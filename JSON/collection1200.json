However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1\/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an \"up\" conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention. A spike protein mutation D614G emerged and became dominant soon after the pandemic started. By engineering the D614G mutation into an authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain, we demonstrate the importance of this mutation to (i) enhanced viral replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, (ii) improved viral fitness in the upper airway of infected hamsters, and (iii) increased susceptibility to neutralization. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this mutation in viral spread, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapy.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jianying Liu","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Xia","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bryan A Johnson","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kumari G Lokugamage","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xianwen Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Antonio E Muruato","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jing Zou","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Camila R Fontes-Garfias","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Divya Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Dionna Scharton","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Birte Kalveram","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N Freiberg","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.278366","rel_title":"An intestinal cell type in zebrafish is the nexus for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contributes to COVID-19 comorbidities","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.278366","rel_abs":"People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTGenomic analyses identify zebrafish orthologs of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contribute to COVID-19 comorbidities and single-cell transcriptomics show that they act in a specialized intestinal cell type.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Postlethwait","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Dylan R Farnsworth","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Adam C Miller","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Xia","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bryan A Johnson","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kumari G Lokugamage","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xianwen Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Antonio E Muruato","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jing Zou","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Camila R Fontes-Garfias","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Divya Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Dionna Scharton","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Birte Kalveram","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N Freiberg","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"developmental biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.278952","rel_title":"Structural Variants in SARS-CoV-2 Occur at Template-Switching Hotspots","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.278952","rel_abs":"The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been carefully monitored since the COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019, however, analysis has focused primarily on single nucleotide polymorphisms and largely ignored the role of structural variants (SVs) as well as recombination in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Using sequences from the GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions are also enriched for 5 and 3 breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in \"arms\" of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting that secondary structure may be a mechanism for TRS-independent template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. These insights into the relationship between structural variation and recombination in SARS-CoV-2 can improve our reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history as well as our understanding of the process of RdRp template-switching in RNA viruses.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brianna Chrisman","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kelley Paskov","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nate Stockham","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tabatabaei","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jae-Yoon Jung","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter Washington","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Maya Varma","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Min Woo Sun","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sepideh Maleki","author_inst":"University of Texas Austin"},{"author_name":"Dennis Paul Wall","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Divya Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Dionna Scharton","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Birte Kalveram","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N Freiberg","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.277780","rel_title":"Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with a human intestine-on-chip device","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.277780","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a global pandemic. The gastrointestinal symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin). Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yaqiong Guo","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Luo","author_inst":"Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yaqing Wang","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pengwei Deng","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Min Zhang","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wang","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kangli Cui","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tingting Tao","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhongyu Li","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Chen","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yongtang Zheng","author_inst":"Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Qin","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Birte Kalveram","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N Freiberg","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.02.20186759","rel_title":"Deep-learning convolutional neural networks with transfer learning accurately classify COVID19 lung infection on portable chest radiographs","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.02.20186759","rel_abs":"Portable chest x-ray (pCXR) has become an indispensable tool in the management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung infection.

This retrospect study employed deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning to classify based on pCXRs COVID-19 pneumonia (N=455) on pCXR from normal (N=532), bacterial pneumonia (N=492), and non-COVID viral pneumonia (N=552). The data was split into 75% training and 25% testing. A five-fold cross-validation was used. Performance was evaluated using receiver-operating curve analysis. Comparison was made with CNN operated on the whole pCXR and segmented lungs. CNN accurately classified COVID-19 pCXR from those of normal, bacterial pneumonia, and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients in a multiclass model. The overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.79, 0.93, and 0.79, 0.85 respectively (whole pCXR), and were 0.91, 0.93, 0.88, and 0.89 (CXR of segmented lung). The performance was generally better using segmented lungs. Heatmaps showed that CNN accurately localized areas of hazy appearance, ground glass opacity and\/or consolidation on the pCXR. Deep-learning convolutional neural network with transfer learning accurately classifies COVID-19 on portable chest x-ray against normal, bacterial pneumonia or non-COVID viral pneumonia. This approach has the potential to help radiologists and frontline physicians by providing more timely and accurate diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shreeja Kikkisetti","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Jocelyn Zhu","author_inst":"stony brook university"},{"author_name":"Beiyi Shen","author_inst":"stony brook university"},{"author_name":"Haifang Li","author_inst":"stony brook university"},{"author_name":"Tim Duong","author_inst":"Stony Brook Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peng Wang","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kangli Cui","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tingting Tao","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhongyu Li","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Chen","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yongtang Zheng","author_inst":"Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Qin","author_inst":"Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Birte Kalveram","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N Freiberg","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.20185074","rel_title":"Fully automated detection and differentiation of pandemic and endemic coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, HKU1, OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) on the Hologic Panther Fusion","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.20185074","rel_abs":"The Hologic Panther Fusion (PF) platform provides fully automated CE marked diagnostics for respiratory viruses, including recently SARS-coronavirus 2 by a transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assay, but not for the endemic human coronaviruses (hCoV).

The novel CE marked Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV were validated with 321 diagnostic specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract in comparison to two SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs (PF E-gene LDT and genesig RT-PCR, 157 specimens) or the R-GENE hCoV \/ hParaFlu RT-PCR (164 specimens), respectively. For the endemic hCoV, results were 96.3% concordant with two specimens discordantly positive in the PF and four specimens discordantly positive in the R-GENE assay. All discordantly positive samples had Ct values between 33 and 39. The PF hCoV LDT identified 23 hCoV positive specimens as NL63, 15 as 229E, 15 as HKU1 and 25 as OC43. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA gave 99.4 % concordant results compared to the consensus results with a single specimen discordantly positive.

To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity2,3 and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology4. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis5-8. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data9. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Reyes","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael R.

Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply. Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed samples, albeit with approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR. We demonstrate that adding lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold. Overall, the limit of detection (LOD) of RT-LAMP using direct nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples without RNA extraction is 1x105-1x106 copies\/ml. This LOD is sufficient to detect samples from which infectious virus can be cultured. Therefore, samples that test positive in this assay contain levels of virus that are most likely to perpetuate transmission. Furthermore, purified RNA in this assay achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR and we provide a revised method to work directly with saliva as starting material. These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 screening programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dawn M Dudley","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Christina M.

Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.\n\nIMPORTANCEReporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felix Pahmeier","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Christopher John Neufeldt","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Berati Cerikan","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Vibhu Prasad","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Constantin Pape","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Vibor Laketa","author_inst":"University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Alessia Ruggieri","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Ralf Bartenschlager","author_inst":"University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Mirko Cortese","author_inst":"University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"David H.

These include smartphone apps, Bluetooth-based proximity detection, location tracking, and automatic exposure notification features. Evidence on the effectiveness of alternative approaches to digital contact tracing is so far limited. We use an age-structured branching process model of the transmission of COVID-19 in different settings to estimate the potential of manual contact tracing and digital tracing systems to help control the epidemic. We investigate the effect of the uptake rate and proportion of contacts recorded by the digital system on key model outputs: the effective reproduction number, the mean outbreak size after 30 days, and the probability of elimination. We show that effective manual contact tracing can reduce the effective reproduction number from 2.4 to around 1.5. The addition of a digital tracing system with a high uptake rate over 75% could further reduce the effective reproduction number to around 1.1. Fully automated digital tracing without manual contact tracing is predicted to be much less effective. We conclude that, for digital tracing systems to make a significant contribution to the control of COVID-19, they need be designed in close conjunction with public health agencies to support and complement manual contact tracing by trained professionals.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury, NZ"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Arco van der Spek","author_inst":"Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA)"},{"author_name":"Paulien Tolsma","author_inst":"Municipal health Services GGD Brabant-Zuidoost"},{"author_name":"Ariene Rietveld","author_inst":"Municipal health Services GGD Hart voor Brabant"},{"author_name":"Miranda Brouwer","author_inst":"Municipal health Services GGD Limburg-Noord"},{"author_name":"Noortje Bouwmeester-Vincken","author_inst":"Municipal health Services GGD Limburg-Noord"},{"author_name":"Frank Harders","author_inst":"Wageningen Bioveterinary Research"},{"author_name":"Renate Hakze-van der Honing","author_inst":"Wageningen Bioveterinary Research"},{"author_name":"Marjolijn C.A.

Tocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody. METHODS Patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard care were randomized (2:1) to double-blinded intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg\/kg or placebo. The primary outcome measure was clinical status on a 7-category ordinal scale at day 28 (1, discharged\/ready for discharge; 7, death). RESULTS Overall, 452 patients were randomized; the modified-intention-to-treat population included 294 tocilizumab-treated and 144 placebo-treated patients. Clinical status at day 28 was not statistically significantly improved for tocilizumab versus placebo (P=0.36). Median (95% CI) ordinal scale values at day 28: 1.0 (1.0 to 1.0) for tocilizumab and 2.0 (1.0 to 4.0) for placebo (odds ratio, 1.19 [0.81 to 1.76]). There was no difference in mortality at day 28 between tocilizumab (19.7%) and placebo (19.4%) (difference, 0.3% [95% CI, -7.6 to 8.2]; nominal P=0.94). Median time to hospital discharge was 8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (20.0 and 28.0, respectively; nominal P=0.037; hazard ratio 1.35 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.79]). Median duration of ICU stay was 5.8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (9.8 and 15.5, respectively; nominal P=0.045). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 34.9% of 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 38.5% of 143 in the placebo arm. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients, tocilizumab did not improve clinical status or mortality. Potential benefits in time to hospital discharge and duration of ICU stay are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan Rosas","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Norbert Br\u00e4u","author_inst":"James J.

However, studies evaluating the clinical performance of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples have demonstrated conflicting results regardless of the collection being in healthcare or community settings. Further, pooled testing with saliva remains a challenge owing to the ambiguous sensitivity, limit of detection (LoD), and processing challenges. To overcome these limitations, SalivaAll protocol was developed and validated as a cost-effective measure that must be used on saliva collected in health care or community settings with pooling utility for SARS-CoV-2 mass surveillance. Methods: The study evaluated 429 matched NPS and saliva samples collected from 344 individuals in either healthcare or community setting. In phase I (protocol U), 240 matched NPS, and saliva samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR. In phase II (SalivaAll protocol), 189 matched NPS and saliva samples were tested, with an additional sample homogenization step for saliva before RNA extraction, followed by RT-PCR. Eighty-five saliva samples were evaluated with both protocols (U and SalivaAll). Subsequently, adopting SalivaAll protocol, a five-sample pooling strategy was evaluated for saliva samples based on FDA recommendations. Results: In phase I, 28.3% (68\/240) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from either saliva, NPS, or both. The detection rate was lower in saliva compared to NPS samples (50.0% vs. 89.7%). In phase II, 50.2% (95\/189) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from either saliva, NPS, or both. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (97.8% vs. 78.9%). Of the 85 saliva samples evaluated by both protocols, 57.6% (49) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with either protocol U, SalivaAll, or both. The detection rate was 100% for samples tested with SalivaAll, whereas it was 36.7% with protocol U. Also, the LoD with SalivaAll protocol was 20 copies\/ml. The pooled testing approach demonstrated a 95% positive and 100% negative percent agreement. Conclusion: This single-site study demonstrated the variability of results reported in the literature for saliva samples, and found that the discrepancies are explained by processing challenges associated with saliva samples. We have optimized a protocol for saliva samples that results in higher sensitivity compared to NPS samples and also breaks the barrier to using pooled saliva testing for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil Shri Sahajpal","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Ashis K Mondal","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Sudha Ananth","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Allan Njau","author_inst":"Aga Khan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Ahluwalia","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Alka Chaubey","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Vamsi Kota","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Caspary","author_inst":"Georgia Army National Guard, Marietta, GA, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Ted M Ross","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Michael Farrell","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael P Shannon","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA."},{"author_name":"Amyn M Rojiani","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Ravindra Kolhe","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Antonio Cubillo Gracian","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario HM Sanchinarro, Centro Integral, Oncologico Clara Campal and Departamento de Ciencias Medicas Clinicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad"},{"author_name":"David J.

Here, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum specimens from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed patients, including patient with mild symptoms but also more severe form including those that require intensive care. We show that nAb titers were strongly correlated with disease severity and with anti-Spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers, whereas patients with milder disease symptoms displayed heterogenous nAb titers and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient care patients had no or poor nAb levels. We found that the nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery, as compared to individuals infected with alternative coronaviruses. We show the absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAb against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which has recently been identified as the major variant now found in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to the understanding of the immune correlate of SARS-CoV-2 induced disease and claim for a rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vincent Legros","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and VetAgro Sup"},{"author_name":"Sol\u00e8ne Denolly","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Manon Vogrig","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Boson","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Josselin Rigaill","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Pillet","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Florence Grattard","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Gonzalo","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Paul Verhoeven","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Omran Allatif","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Philippe Berthelot","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Carole P\u00e9lissier","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Thierry","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Botelho-Nevers","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Paul","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Thierry Walzer","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois-Lo\u00efc Cosset","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bourlet","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Bruno Pozzetto","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Balpreet Matharu","author_inst":"Roche Products Ltd"},{"author_name":"Helen Spotswood","author_inst":"Roche Products Ltd"},{"author_name":"Larry Tsai","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Atul Malhotra","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182766","rel_title":"Modeling Dynamic Network Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Control on a Cruise Ship","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182766","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have occurred on several nautical vessels, driven by the high-density contact networks on these ships. Optimal strategies for prevention and control that account for realistic contact networks are needed. We developed a network-based transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess outbreak to characterize transmission dynamics and to estimate the epidemiological impact of outbreak control and prevention measures. This model represented the dynamic multi-layer network structure of passenger-passenger, passenger-crew, and crew-crew contacts, both before and after the large-scale network lockdown imposed on the ship in response to the disease outbreak. Model scenarios evaluated variations in the timing of the network lockdown, reduction in contact intensity within the sub-networks, and diagnosis-based case isolation on outbreak prevention. We found that only extreme restrictions in contact patterns during network lockdown and idealistic clinical response scenarios could avert a major COVID-19 outbreak. Contact network changes associated with adequate outbreak prevention were the restriction of passengers to their cabins, with limited passenger-crew contacts. Clinical response strategies required for outbreak prevention included early mass screening with an ideal PCR test (100% sensitivity) and immediate case isolation upon diagnosis. Public health restrictions on optional leisure activities like these should be considered until longer-term effective solutions such as a COVID-19 vaccine become widely available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel M Jenness","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn S Willebrand","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Amyn A Malik","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Lopman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Pillet","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Florence Grattard","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Gonzalo","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Paul Verhoeven","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Omran Allatif","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Philippe Berthelot","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Carole P\u00e9lissier","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Thierry","author_inst":"University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Botelho-Nevers","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Paul","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Thierry Walzer","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois-Lo\u00efc Cosset","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bourlet","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Bruno Pozzetto","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie and University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne"},{"author_name":"Balpreet Matharu","author_inst":"Roche Products Ltd"},{"author_name":"Helen Spotswood","author_inst":"Roche Products Ltd"},{"author_name":"Larry Tsai","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Atul Malhotra","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182246","rel_title":"Prevalence and risk factors of disability and anxiety in a retrospective cohort of 432 survivors of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (Covid-19) from China","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182246","rel_abs":"Objective: To estimate the prevalence of disability and anxiety in Covid-19 survivors at discharge from hospital and analyze relative risk by exposures. Design: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. Setting: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. Methods: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). Results: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63- 33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations. Conclusion: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siyi Zhu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wenguang Xia","author_inst":"Hubei Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiguo Cai","author_inst":"Henan Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanping Hui","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Di Zhu","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Guiqing Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Shihezi University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Wu","author_inst":"The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Zhou","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Baotou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongfei Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of General Bureau of Agricultural Reclamation of Heilongjiang Province"},{"author_name":"Changjie Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhang","author_inst":"Nanchong central hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianrong Yang","author_inst":"Garze People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mei Feng","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhong Ni","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Baoyu Chen","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chunping Du","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hongchen He","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Qu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Quan Wei","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chengqi He","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jan D.

This paper reports tools to classify patients based on symptom profiles based on 236 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and 564 controls, accounting for the time course of illness at point of assessment. Clinical differentiators of cases and controls were used to derive model-based risk scores. Significant symptoms included abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, fever, headache, muscle ache, runny nose, sore throat, temperature between 37.5{degrees}C and 37.9{degrees}C, and temperature above 38{degrees}C, but their importance varied by day of illness at assessment. With a high percentile threshold for specificity at 0.95, the baseline model had reasonable sensitivity at 0.67. To further evaluate accuracy of model predictions, we firstly used leave-one-out cross-validation, which confirmed high classification accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92. For the baseline model, sensitivity decreased to 0.56. Secondly, in a separate ongoing prospective study of 237 COVID-19 and 346 primary care patients presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, the baseline model had a sensitivity of 0.57 and specificity of 0.89, and in retrospective notes review of 100 COVID-19 cases diagnosed in primary care, sensitivity was 0.56. A web-app based tool has been developed for easy implementation as an adjunct to laboratory testing to differentiate COVID-19 positive cases among patients presenting in outpatient settings.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yinan Mao","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yi-Roe Tan","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tun-Linn Thein","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Louis Chai","author_inst":"National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Alex Cook","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore\/ Department of Statistics and Applied P"},{"author_name":"Borame Dickens","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yii-Jen Lew","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Fong Seng Lim","author_inst":"Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jue Tao Lim","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yinxiaohe Sun","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Meena Sundaram","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Alexius Soh","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases\/ Department of Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"},{"author_name":"Glorijoy Tan","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases\/ Department of Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"},{"author_name":"Franco Wong","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Young","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kangwei Zeng","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Mark Chen","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases\/ Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapor"},{"author_name":"Desmond Ong","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Zhong Ni","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Baoyu Chen","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chunping Du","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hongchen He","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Qu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Quan Wei","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chengqi He","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jan D.

Chest X-Rays are one of the noninvasive tools to detect this disease as the manual PCR diagnosis process is quite tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we propose an automated COVID-19 classifier, utilizing available COVID and non-COVID X-Ray datasets, along with High Resolution Network (HRNet) for feature extraction embedding with the UNet for segmentation purposes. To evaluate the proposed dataset, several baseline experiments have been performed employing numerous deep learning architectures. With extensive experiment, we got 99.26% accuracy, 98.53% sensitivity, and 98.82% specificity with HRNet which surpasses the performances of the existing models.

SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted between people in close contact and causes disproportionately severe disease in older people. Methods Data and SARS-CoV-2 samples were collected from patients in the East of England (EoE) between 26th February and 10th May 2020. Care home residents were identified using address search terms and Care Quality Commission registration information. Samples were sequenced at the University of Cambridge or the Wellcome Sanger Institute and viral clusters defined based on genomic and time differences between cases. Findings 7,406 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from 6,600 patients were identified, of which 1,167 (18.2%) were residents from 337 care homes. 30\/71 (42.3%) care home residents tested at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) died. Genomes were available for 700\/1,167 (60%) residents from 292 care homes, and 409 distinct viral clusters were defined. We identified several probable transmissions between care home residents and healthcare workers (HCW). Interpretation Care home residents had a significant burden of COVID-19 infections and high mortality. Larger viral clusters were consistent with within-care home transmission, while multiple clusters per care home suggested independent acquisitions.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William L Hamilton","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gerry Tonkin-Hill","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Emily Smith","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire County Council, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Houldcroft","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Warne","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Luke Meredith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Myra Hosmillo","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aminu Jahun","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Martin Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Caller","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah Caddy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Malte Pinckert","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Iliana Georgana","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yasmin Chaudhry","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sonia Goncalves","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Roberto Amato","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ewan Harrison","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Mathew Beale","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Spencer Chapman","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"David Jackson","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Johnston","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Alex Alderton","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"John Sillitoe","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Cordelia Langford","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dominic Kwiatowski","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

Design, setting, participants We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 that was open to any healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout as measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety and distress as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Scale-7, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were recorded along with subjective measures of stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. Results Of 539 persons responding to the survey, 90% were female, and 26% were aged 41-50 years, 53% were nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% [206\/424] versus 33% [38\/115] under 40 years, P=0.004), and more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P=0.031). They were twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.3, P=0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, P<0.001), and were almost 4-times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-5.9, P=0.012). A supportive workplace team and male sex protected against burnout reducing the odds by 40% (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7, P<0.001) and 70% (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion Independent predictors of burnout were younger staff, redeployment to a new working area, working with patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and being female or having a previous history of depression.

As universities around the world decide whether to remain open or to close their campuses because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they often are doing so without objective information on the preferences and risk tolerance of their students. Objectives. To quantify: 1) risk tolerance for in-person instruction; 2) willingness to pay for in-person instruction versus online-only instruction; and 3) risk-tolerance for social activities held off campus among knowledgable students. Design, Setting, and Participants. We developed an automated survey tool that administered a standard gamble exercise grounded in game theory to 46 Columbia University public health graduate students who were knowledgeable about COVID-19 and who had experience with both online and offline coursework. Students were asked to trade between the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and: 1) attending classes in-person versus online and 2) attending parties in the greater New York City area. We also assessed their willingness to pay for online only tuition, and plans to travel off campus. Main Outcome Measures. The decision point in iterative trade-offs between risk of infection with COVID-19 and a desired goal (taking classes in-person or attending social events). Results. On average, students were willing to accept a 23% (standard error [SE]: 4%) risk of infection on campus over the semester in exchange for the opportunity to attend classes in-person. Students were willing-to-pay only 48% (SE: 3%) of typical in-person tuition were courses held exclusively online, and no students were willing to pay full price for online-only instruction. Students planned to leave campus an average of 3.6 times per week (SE: 0.54), and 15% of the students would be willing to attend a party in the community surrounding the university even if the prevalence of circulating COVID-19 were high. Conclusions and Relevance. Students with a strong knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and risks are an enigma: they are willing to pay only around 50% for online classes but likely to engage in activities that present significant barriers to holding in-person classes. This enigma underscores the conundrum facing universities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zafar Zafari","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Lee Goldman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Katia Korvizhkin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Peter Muennig","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ben Warne","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Luke Meredith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Myra Hosmillo","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aminu Jahun","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Martin Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Caller","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah Caddy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Malte Pinckert","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Iliana Georgana","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yasmin Chaudhry","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sonia Goncalves","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Roberto Amato","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ewan Harrison","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Mathew Beale","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Spencer Chapman","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"David Jackson","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Johnston","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Alex Alderton","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"John Sillitoe","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Cordelia Langford","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dominic Kwiatowski","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

Materials and methods: Serum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR and\/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM\/IgG was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China\/Healgen Scientific, LLC, U.S.A.]). Results: One hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than or equal to 900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI greater than or equal to 700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and\/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69\/74; 95% CI: 85.1% - 97.1%) and 87.8% (65\/74; 95% CI: 78.5% - 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93\/100; 95% CI: 86.3% - 96.6%) and 100.0% for IgG (100\/100; 95% CI: 96.3% - 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100% for IgM (200\/200; 95% CI: 98.1% - 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199\/200; 95% CI: 97.2% - 99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG. Conclusion: The rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 specific IgM\/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. While the specificity was not affected by production lot, external validation of separate lots of rapid POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tove Hoffman","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Linda Kolstad","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Bengt Ronnberg","author_inst":"Uppsala University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ake Lundkvist","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Ben Warne","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Luke Meredith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Myra Hosmillo","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aminu Jahun","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Martin Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Caller","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah Caddy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Malte Pinckert","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Iliana Georgana","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yasmin Chaudhry","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sonia Goncalves","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Roberto Amato","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ewan Harrison","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Mathew Beale","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Spencer Chapman","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"David Jackson","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Johnston","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Alex Alderton","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"John Sillitoe","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Cordelia Langford","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dominic Kwiatowski","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

To be prepared for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall, it seems of utmost importance to analyze the epidemiological and socio-economic characteristics of the spring outbreak in the population. Method: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test when having been tested. These associations were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyzes using a hybrid tree-based regression model. Results: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. 7.6% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyzes adjusted on exposure factors show that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were sex and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. Conclusion: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rodolphe Jantzen","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nolwenn Noisel","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sophie Camilleri-Broet","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Labbe","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Thibault de Malliard","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yves Payette","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Philippe Broet","author_inst":"CARTaGENE, CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, 3175 Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, H3T1C5, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Aminu Jahun","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Martin Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Caller","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah Caddy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Malte Pinckert","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Iliana Georgana","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yasmin Chaudhry","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sonia Goncalves","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Roberto Amato","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ewan Harrison","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Mathew Beale","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Spencer Chapman","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"David Jackson","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Johnston","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Alex Alderton","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"John Sillitoe","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Cordelia Langford","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dominic Kwiatowski","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

A recent longitudinal cohort from Italy including 143 patients recovered after hospitalisation with COVID-19 reported that 87% had at least one ongoing symptom at 60 day follow-up. Early indications suggest that patients with COVID-19 may need even more psychological support than typical ICU patients. The assessment of risk factors for longer term consequences requires a longitudinal study linked to data on pre-existing conditions and care received during the acute phase of illness. Methods and analysis This is an international open-access prospective, observational multi-site study. It will enrol patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19. Tier 1 is developed for following up patients day 28 post-discharge, additionally at 3 to 6 months intervals. This module can be used to identify sub-sets of patients experiencing specific symptomatology or syndromes for further follow up. A Tier 2 module will be developed for in-clinic, in-depth follow up. The primary aim is to characterise physical consequences in patients post-COVID-19. Secondary aim includes estimating the frequency of and risk factors for post-COVID- 19 medical sequalae, psychosocial consequences and post-COVID-19 mortality. A subset of patients will have sampling to characterize longer term antibody, innate and cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Ethics and dissemination This collaborative, open-access study aims to characterize the frequency of and risk factors for long-term consequences and characterise the immune response over time in patients following a diagnosis of COVID-19 and facilitate standardized and longitudinal data collection globally. The outcomes of this study will inform strategies to prevent long term consequences; inform clinical management, direct rehabilitation, and inform public health management to reduce overall morbidity and improve outcomes of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise Sigfrid","author_inst":"ISARIC Global Support Centre,  University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Muge Cevik","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Edwin Jesudason","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Lim","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jordi Rello","author_inst":"Vall d Hebron Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"John Humphrey Amuasi","author_inst":"Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and Kumasi Center for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fernando Bozza","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Carlo Palmieri","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Daniel Munblit","author_inst":"Institute of Childs Health, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University)"},{"author_name":"Jan Cato Holter","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anders Benjamin Kildal","author_inst":"University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Antonia Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Thomas M Drake","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Anna Beltrame","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katrina Hann","author_inst":"Sustainable Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Richard Bangura","author_inst":"Dorothy Springer Trust"},{"author_name":"Rob Fowler","author_inst":"Sunnybrook hospital, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Lakoh","author_inst":"Sustainable Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Colin Berry","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"David J Lowe","author_inst":"Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanne McPeake","author_inst":"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, University of Glasgow Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Madiha Hashmi","author_inst":"Critical Care Medicine, Ziauddin University, Pakistan Registry of Intensive CarE (PRICE)"},{"author_name":"Anne Margarita Dyrhol-Riise","author_inst":"Oslo University hospital"},{"author_name":"Chloe Donohue","author_inst":"Liverpool Clinical Trials Centre, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Plotkin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hayley Hardwick","author_inst":"National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Liverpool, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Natalie Elkheir","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"Usher Institute"},{"author_name":"Annemarie B Docherty","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"Usher Institute,  University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kenneth J Baille","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Gail Carson","author_inst":"ISARIC, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Semple","author_inst":"Health Protection Research Unit In Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Janet T Scott","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182709","rel_title":"Cardiometabolic Risk Factors for COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182709","rel_abs":"Importance: Early epidemiological studies report associations of diverse cardiometabolic conditions especially body mass index (BMI), with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, but causality has not been established. Identifying causal risk factors is critical to inform preventive strategies aimed at modifying disease risk. Objective: We sought to evaluate the causal associations of cardiometabolic conditions with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Design: Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) Study. Setting: Population-based cohorts that contributed to the genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Participants: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosed by RNA PCR, serologic testing, or clinician diagnosis. Population controls defined as anyone who was not a case in the cohorts. Exposures: Selected genetic variants associated with 17 cardiometabolic diseases, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and BMI, at p<5 x 10-8 from published largescale GWAS. Main outcomes: We performed an inverse-variance weighted averages of variant-specific causal estimates for susceptibility, defined as people who tested positive for COVID-19 vs. population controls, and severity, defined as patients hospitalized with COVID-19 vs. population controls, and repeated the analysis for BMI using effect estimates from UKBB. To estimate direct and indirect causal effects of BMI through obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases, we performed pairwise multivariable MR. We used p<0.05\/17 exposure\/2 outcomes=0.0015 to declare statistical significance. Results: Genetically increased BMI was causally associated with testing positive for COVID-19 [6,696 cases \/ 1,073,072 controls; p=6.7 x 10-4, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.08 (1.03, 1.13) per kg\/m2] and a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization [3,199 cases\/897,488 controls; p=8.7 x 10-4, 1.12 (1.04, 1.21) per kg\/m2]. In the multivariable MR, the direct effect of BMI was abolished upon conditioning on the effect on type 2 diabetes but persisted when conditioning on the effects on coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and c-reactive protein. No other cardiometabolic exposures tested were associated with a higher risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Genetic evidence supports BMI as a causal risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. This relationship may be mediated via type 2 diabetes. Obesity may have amplified the disease burden of the COVID-19 pandemic either single-handedly or through its metabolic consequences.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aaron Leong","author_inst":"MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL"},{"author_name":"Joanne Cole","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura N.

While the landscape of diagnostics is rapidly evolving, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold-standard of nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays, in part due to its reliability, flexibility, and wide deployment. To address a critical local shortage of testing capacity persisting during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital set up a molecular based laboratory developed test (LDT) to accurately and safely diagnose SARS-CoV-2. We describe here the process of developing an emergency-use LDT, in the hope that our experience will be useful to other laboratories in future outbreaks and will help to lower barriers to fast and accurate diagnostic testing in crisis conditions.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Melis N.

The national survey 'COVID-19 related Anxiety and StreSs in prEgnancy, poSt-partum and breaStfeeding' (COVID-ASSESS) was conducted during the first month of full lockdown in Italy. The questionnaire was specifically developed to examine COVID-19 concerns and included the psychometric tests NSESSS for PTSD and STAI-Y for anxiety. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to explore the association of the concern, anxiety and PTSD symptoms with age, gestational weeks, parity, days of lockdown, assisted reproductive technology use, psychopathological history and previous perinatal losses. Out of 1015 pregnant women reached, 737 (72.6%) fully answered the questionnaire; no woman reported a COVID-19 infection. Median age was 34.4 years [quartiles 31.7, 37.2], median days in lockdown were 13.1 [11.0, 17.0], median gestational weeks were 27.8 [19.8, 34.0]. Clinically significant PTSD symptoms were present in 75 women (10.2%, NSESSS cut-off 24) and clinically significant anxiety symptoms were present in 160 women (21.7%, STAI-Y1 cut-off 50). Women were less worried about their own health than the health of their baby and of their elderly relatives. Previous anxiety predicted higher concern and PTSD symptoms; previous depression and anxiety were independently associated with current PTSD symptoms.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia Ravaldi","author_inst":"PeaRL Perinatal Research Laboratory, University of Florence; CiaoLapo Foundation for Perinatal Health, Prato, Italy"},{"author_name":"Valdo Ricca","author_inst":"Psychiatry Unit, Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alyce Wilson","author_inst":"Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health Program, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Caroline Homer","author_inst":"Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health Program, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Vannacci","author_inst":"PeaRL Perinatal Research Laboratory, University of Florence; CiaoLapo Foundation for Perinatal Health, Prato, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gordon Adams","author_inst":"Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen F.

With regards to long-term consequences, biomarkers of physiological effects as well as the psychological experiences are of significant importance for comprehensively understanding the whole COVID-19 recovery period. The present research surveys the IgG antibody titers and the impact of COVID-19 as a traumatic experience in the aftermath of the active infection period, around two months after diagnosis, in a subset of COVID-19 patients from the first wave of the outbreak in Northern Cyprus. Associations of antibody titers and psychological survey measures with baseline characteristics and disease severity were explored, and correlations among various measures were evaluated. Of the 47 serology tests conducted for presence of IgG antibodies, 39 (83%) were positive. We identified trends demonstrating individuals experiencing severe or critical COVID-19 disease and\/or those with comorbidities are more heavily impacted both physiologically and mentally, with higher IgG titers and negative psychological experience compared to those with milder disease and without comorbidities. We also observed that more than half of the COVID-19 cases had negative psychological experiences, being subjected to discrimination and\/or verbal harassment\/insult, by family\/friends. In summary, as the first study co-evaluating immune response together with mental status, our findings suggest that further multidisciplinary research in larger sample populations as well as community intervention plans are needed to holistically address the physiological and psychological effects of COVID-19 among the cases in the long-term.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burc Barin","author_inst":"The Emmes Company, Rockville, Maryland, USA."},{"author_name":"Banu Elcin Yoldascan","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Cyprus International University, Nicosia, North Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Fatma Savaskan","author_inst":"Headnursing Department, Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital, Nicosia, North Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Goncagul Ozbalikci","author_inst":"Microbiology Laboratory, Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital, Nicosia, North Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Tugce Karaderi","author_inst":"Disease Systems Biology Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhag"},{"author_name":"Huseyin Cakal","author_inst":"School of Psychology, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, Staffordshire, UK."},{"author_name":"Stephen F.

The importance of indoor, airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized; nevertheless, no quantitative measures have been proposed to protect against it. In this article, we build upon models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive a safety guideline that would impose a precise upper bound on the cumulative exposure time, the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate the manner in which this bound depends on the ventilation rate and dimensions of the room; the breathing rate, respiratory activity and face-mask use of its occupants; and the infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols, a disease-specific parameter that we estimate from available data. Case studies are presented, implications for contact tracing considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Z.
