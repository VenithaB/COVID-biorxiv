Despite rapid advances in diagnostic test development and scale-up, there remains an ongoing need for SARS-CoV-2 tests which are highly sensitive, specific, minimally invasive, cost-effective and scalable for broad testing and surveillance. Here we report development of a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay on the automated HD-X platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood (fingerstick). In pre-pandemic and clinical sample sets, the assay has 100% specificity and 97.4% sensitivity for serum \/ plasma samples. The limit of detection (LoD) estimated by titration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus is 0.2 pg\/ml, corresponding to 0.05 Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) per ml, > 2000 times more sensitive than current EUA approved antigen tests. No cross-reactivity to other common respiratory viruses, including hCoV229E, hCoVOC43, hCoVNL63, Influenza A or Influenza B, was observed. We detected elevated N-protein concentrations in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic PCR+ individuals using capillary blood from a finger-stick collection device. The Simoa SARS-CoV-2 N-protein assay has the potential to detect COVID-19 infection via antigen in blood with similar or better performance characteristics of molecular tests, while also enabling at home and point of care sample collection.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dandan Shan","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Johnson","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Syrena C Fernandes","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Muriel Mendes","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hannah Suib","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Marcella Holdridge","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Elaine M Burke","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Katie G Beauregard","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Megan Cleary","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Samantha Xu","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yao","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Purvish P Patel","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Plavina","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"David H Wilson","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim M Kaiser","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Jacob Natterman","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn, and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF),"},{"author_name":"Susanne V Schmidt","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Eicke Latz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn and German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.15.20175588","rel_title":"A data-driven epidemiological model to explain the Covid-19 pandemic in multiple countries and help in choosing mitigation strategies","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.15.20175588","rel_abs":"Accurate models are fundamental to understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate different mitigation strategies.

The good quality of the fits makes it possible to explore different scenarios and evaluate the impact of both individual and collective behaviors and government- level decisions to mitigate the epidemic. We identify robust alternatives to lockdown, such as self- protection measures, and massive testing. Furthermore, communication and risk perception are fundamental to modulate the success of different strategies.

Design We used an online survey to conduct this cross-sectional study among nursing staff in different settings. Data collection was carried out between 12 May and 13 July 2020. Methods The survey included questions that allowed us to collect demographic data (e.g. age), professional qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and data regarding the federal states and settings in which the participants worked. In additon, we asked the participants to describe their COVID-19 symptoms, if any were experienced, and the result of COVID-19 testing that they underwent. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis methods to calculate differences. Findings More than 80% of the nursing staff (N = 2600) were women, nearly half of these staff members worked in the province of Styria and about three-quarters worked in hospitals. In general, nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces with regard to the COVID-19 symptoms reported, but not the test results. The highest porportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria and in the primary care sector. In total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, as well as about 1% of the nurses who worked in the nursing homes. The highest number of tests were carried out in Vienna followed by the province of Burgenland. In total, all of the nurses who underwent testing were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions Only 1% of the nurses who worked in nursing homes were tested. This group of nurses takes care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group in Austrian society. Therefore, the nursing home staff should have the possibility to be tested even though they did not experience\/report any symptoms. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in the primary care sector. In the future during a pandemic, health care staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings. Clinical Relevance Providing insights into COVID-19 symptoms experienced by nursing staff workforce and testing for COVID-19 can help us address these aspects in future pandemics more efficiently. In addition, these insights can help to shift the perspectives from critical and acute settings to other settings, e.g. nursing homes. This is an important change in perspectives, as these nurses have worked with the most vulnerable and high-risk group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the safety of nursing home residents and providing, high-quality nursing care and interventions can reduce hospital admission rates, decrease health care costs during such pandemics and might even reduce secondary morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuela Hoedl","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Doris Eglseer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bauer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Joana Goncalves-Sa","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

Clinical findings indicated that the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b) protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I\/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK{varepsilon} rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitates the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity, thus, facilitate virus replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 impaired antiviral immunity and providing an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lulu Han","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity of Shandong Province, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong"},{"author_name":"Meng-Wei Zhuang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity of Shandong Province, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Mei-Ling Nan","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Chengjiang Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity of Shandong Province, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong"},{"author_name":"Katie G Beauregard","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Megan Cleary","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Samantha Xu","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yao","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Purvish P Patel","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Plavina","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"David H Wilson","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim M Kaiser","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Jacob Natterman","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn, and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF),"},{"author_name":"Susanne V Schmidt","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Eicke Latz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn and German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.252676","rel_title":"A lesson from COVID-19 on inaccessibility of web-based information for disabled populations worldwide","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.252676","rel_abs":"Many government websites and mobile content are inaccessible for people with vision, hearing, and cognitive disabilities.

All these findings indicated that public clones might not occur by random and they might exert essential functions. However, the frequencies and functions of public clones in a population have never been studied. Here, we integrated 2,449 Rep-seq datasets from 767 donors and discovered 5.07 million public clones - ~10% of the repertoire are public in population. We found 38 therapeutic clones out of 3,390 annotated public clones including anti-PD1 clones in healthy people. Moreover, we also revealed clones neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV-1 viruses in healthy individuals. Our result demonstrated that these clones are predisposed in the human antibody repertoire and may exert critical functions during particular immunological stimuli and consequently benefit the donors.

Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1\/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nehemya Friedman","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Jacob-Hirsch","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Yaron Drori","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Eran Eyal","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Nitzan Kol","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Omri Nayshool","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Ella Mendelson","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Gidi Rechavi","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Michal Mandelboim","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chengrui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Wenxi Xie","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Cuiyu Ma","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Guan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Shixin Guo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Sen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Changqing Chang","author_inst":"Integrate Microbiology Research Center, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lai Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen Univer"},{"author_name":"Zhenhai Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174961","rel_title":"Rates of COVID-19-related Outcomes in Cancer compared to non-Cancer Patients","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174961","rel_abs":"Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, healthcare exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled prior to the pandemic in a large academic biobank (n=67 cancer patients and n=256 non-cancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.12-4.18) and 30-day mortality (OR 5.67, CI 1.49-21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lova Sun","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Surya Sanjna","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anh Le","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Heena Desai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Abigail Doucette","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Peter Gabriel","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Marylyn Ritchie","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rader","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ivan Maillard","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Bange","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Alexander Huang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Robert H Vonderheide","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Angela DeMichele","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anurag Verma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ronac Mamtani","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kara N Maxwell","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lai Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen Univer"},{"author_name":"Zhenhai Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174805","rel_title":"The basic reproduction number can be accurately estimated within 14 days after societal lockdown: The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174805","rel_abs":"Objective: Early identification of the basic reproduction number (BRN) is imperative to political decision making during an epidemic. In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). Results: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020. Conclusion: We believe our model provides a valuable tool for decision makers to reliably estimate the effect of a politically determined lockdown during an epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Brink Valentin","author_inst":"Danish Center for Clinical Health Services Research (DACS), Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University and Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmar"},{"author_name":"Henrik M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"The Danish Clinical Registries (RKKP), Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Paaske Johnsen","author_inst":"Danish Center for Clinical Health Services Research (DACS), Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University and Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmar"},{"author_name":"Heena Desai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Abigail Doucette","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Peter Gabriel","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Marylyn Ritchie","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rader","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ivan Maillard","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Bange","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Alexander Huang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Robert H Vonderheide","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Angela DeMichele","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anurag Verma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ronac Mamtani","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kara N Maxwell","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lai Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen Univer"},{"author_name":"Zhenhai Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175299","rel_title":"Newborn dried blood spots for serological surveys of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175299","rel_abs":"As COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe, the need for inexpensive, large-scale prevalence surveillance testing increases.

We found that relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated authentic virus-neutralizing titers and antibody levels against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 region of spike protein. Unlike disease severity, age and sex played lesser roles in serological responses. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. RBD- and S2-specific and neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated and stable for at least 2-3 months post-onset, whereas those against N were more variable with rapid declines in many samples. Testing of 5882 self-recruited members of the local community demonstrated that 1.24% of individuals showed antibody reactivity to RBD. However, 18% (13\/73) of these putative seropositive samples failed to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of the neutralizing, but only 1 of the non-neutralizing samples, also displayed potent reactivity to S2. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays markedly improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the viral antigen. In contrast to other reports, we conclude that immunity is durable for at least several months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tyler J Ripperger","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Uhrlaub","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Makiko Watanabe","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Rachel Wong","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Castaneda","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Hannah A Pizzato","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Mallory R Thompson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christine Bradshaw","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Craig C Weinkauf","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christian Bime","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Heidi L Erickson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175265","rel_title":"Assessment of physiological signs associated with COVID-19 measured using wearable devices","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175265","rel_abs":"Respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability are some health metrics that are easily measured by consumer devices and which can potentially provide early signs of illness. Furthermore, mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 - a symptom-based approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced, age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 - July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and 0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +\/- 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +\/- 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a specific day with 4 previous days of history. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while heart rate variability is decreased. Measuring these metrics can help in early diagnosis, and in monitoring the progress of the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aravind Natarajan","author_inst":"Fitbit"},{"author_name":"Hao-Wei Su","author_inst":"Fitbit"},{"author_name":"Conor Heneghan","author_inst":"Fitbit"},{"author_name":"Rachel Wong","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Castaneda","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Hannah A Pizzato","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Mallory R Thompson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christine Bradshaw","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Craig C Weinkauf","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christian Bime","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Heidi L Erickson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175018","rel_title":"Socio-demographic, clinical, hospital admission and oxygen requirement characteristics of COVID-19 patients of Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175018","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Clinical presentation hospital admission and outcome of COVID-19 pandemic are different from one country to another.

A preformed questionnaire adapted in Google form and circulated through online to collect data. Informed consent was ensured before participation in this study. Results: We have studied of 305 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients mean age was 36.32(+\/-12.369) years with male predominance and majority were doctor 46.9%. 48.8% of the patients family members affected along with them. After COVID-19 pandemic 31.7% did not go out of their house. For prevention (72.4%)of the patients used mask and 38.8% used hand gloves during outing. 28.7% reported to be affected while working in hospital 21.8%were affected in their office. Fever (80.1%) cough (57.7%) pain in throat (50.8%) rhinitis (45.9%) and loss of smell (45%) and taste sensation (45.6%) were the most common symptoms. Sample was given average 3 (+\/- 3.384) days after onset of the symptoms and report was delivered average 4.57 days after giving sample. After getting result 32.1% of the patients seek treatment in telemedicine and 23% directly consulted in Government hospital only 2% reported to be treated by the Government designated telephone number. 73.1% of the patient took both steam inhalation and warm water gargling. Paracetamol and antihistamine was the most commonly use drugs 69.8% and 71.5% respectively besides 47.5% took ivermectin 41.6% took azithromycin 35.1% steroid 34.8% took doxycyclin and 21.6% hydroxychloroquine. Among the patients only 20.3% needed hospital admission. The patients admitted in hospital average 5 (+\/-3.922) days after onset of symptoms and hospital staying was 9.2 days (average). Breathless (54.83%) was the major cause of hospital admission and 19.35% patients admitted due to fear. 14% patients needed oxygen and average duration of oxygen was 4.84 days. 81.3% patients has taken oxygen in hospital and 18.8% at their home. Among the patient 2.2% needed ICU and artificial ventilation needed for 1.1% patients. The patients recovered after 17.74 days (average) from the onset of symptom. COVID-19 became negative (RT-PCR) at15th day from onset of symptom. 91.8%) were in mental stress to become the cause of infection spread to other family members 20.7%) reported that they were anxious that they would not get oxygen or ICU if required and 27.9% were suffering from fear of death. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom in 57.4% cases. Average time required for coming back to normal life was 21.59 days (+\/-7.901) ranging a wide range from 5 to 60 days. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients were mostly male health worker. Fever cough pain in throat were most common symptoms. Hospital admission required in only one-fifth cases and ICU required for only 2% patients. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom.

A better understanding of symptoms, comorbidities and medication used for pre-existing conditions in patients with COVID-19 could help healthcare workers identify patients at increased risk of developing more severe disease. Here, we have used self-reported data (symptoms, medications and comorbidities) from more than 3 million users from the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker app12 to identify previously reported and novel features predictive of patients being admitted in a hospital setting. Despite previously reported association between age and more severe disease phenotypes, we found that patient's age, sex and ethnic group were minimally predictive when compared to patient's symptoms and comorbidities. The most important variables selected by our predictive algorithm were fever, the use of immunosuppressant medication, mobility aid, shortness of breath and fatigue. It is anticipated that early administration of preventative measures in COVID-19 positive patients (COVID+) who exhibit a high risk of hospitalization signature may prevent severe disease progression.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yingxiang Huang","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"Dina Radenkovic","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin Perez","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"Kari Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Eric Verdin","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"David Furman","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"Jafrin Sultana","author_inst":"Society of General Physicians and Daktarkhana (GP center)"},{"author_name":"Moni Rani","author_inst":"Rajshahi Medical College"},{"author_name":"Craig C Weinkauf","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christian Bime","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Heidi L Erickson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175257","rel_title":"Vaccine optimization for COVID-19, who to vaccinate first?","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175257","rel_abs":"A vaccine, when available, will likely become our best tool to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.

There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. Methods: We addressed both questions using cohort studies derived from an electronic health records (EHR) network of 69 million patients including over 62,000 cases of COVID-19. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Findings: In patients with no prior psychiatric history, COVID-19 was associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric diagnoses in the three months after infection compared to 6 other health events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 2.1 [1.8-2.5] compared to influenza; 1.7 [1.5-1.9] compared to other respiratory tract infections; 1.6 [1.4-1.9] compared to skin infection; 1.6 [1.3.1-9] compared to cholelithiasis; 2.2 [1.9-2.6] compared to urolithiasis, and 2.1 [1.9-2.5] compared to fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The increase was greatest for anxiety disorders but also present for depression, insomnia, and dementia. The results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. There was a ~30% reduction in psychiatric diagnoses in the total EHR population over the same period. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a 65% higher incidence of COVID-19 (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI: 1.59-1.71, p<0.0001). This was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection has both psychiatric sequelae and psychiatric antecedents. Survivors have an increased rate of new onset psychiatric disorders, and prior psychiatric disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. The findings have implications for research into aetiology and highlight the need for clinical services to provide multidisciplinary follow-up, and prompt detection and treatment.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxime Taquet","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sierra Luciano","author_inst":"TriNetX Inc, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"John R Geddes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul J Harrison","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"NICOLA SIGISMONDI","author_inst":"ICT CONSULTANT"},{"author_name":"Stefan Lautenbacher","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Peichl","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timo Wollmershaeuser","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Fuest","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20158535","rel_title":"Impact of contact tracing on COVID-19 mortality: An impact evaluation using surveillance data from Colombia.","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20158535","rel_abs":"Background Contact tracing is a key part of the public health surveillance toolkit. However, it is labor intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations to our knowledge have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country and provides data to support the expansion of contact tracing strategies with the aim of improving infection control. Methods We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N=54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). We proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified, as suggested by WHO guidelines. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental to contain infectious diseases and its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will have a substantial impact on reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andres I.

The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge in the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. Multivariable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46,49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58,61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48,50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ATKURE DEFAR","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Gebeyaw Molla","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Saro Abdella","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Masresha Tessema","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Muhammed Ahmed","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ashenif Tadele","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Fikresilassie Getachew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Bezawit Hailegiorgis","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Eyasu Tigabu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Sabit Ababor Sr.","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ketema Bizuwork","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Assefa Deressa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Geremew Tasew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Addisu kebede","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Daniel Melese","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Andargachew Gashu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kirubel Eshetu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Adamu Tayachew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Mesfin Wossen","author_inst":"mesfinwossen@gmail.com"},{"author_name":"Abduilhafiz Hassen","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Shambel Habebe","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zewdu Assefa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Aschalew Abayneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tollera","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174649","rel_title":"Widespread testing, case isolation and contact tracing may allow safe school reopening with continued moderate physical distancing: a modeling analysis of King County, WA data","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174649","rel_abs":"Background In late March 2020, a \"Stay Home, Stay Healthy\" order was issued in Washington State in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 1, a 4-phase reopening plan began. If implemented without interruptions, all types of public interactions were planned to resume by July 15. We investigated whether adjunctive prevention strategies would allow less restrictive physical distancing to avoid second epidemic waves and secure safe school reopening. Methods We developed a mathematical model, stratifying the population by age (0-19 years, 20-49 years, 50-69 years, and 70+ years), infection status (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, recovered) and treatment status (undiagnosed, diagnosed, hospitalized) to project SARS-CoV-2 transmission during and after the reopening period. The model was parameterized with demographic and contact data from King County, WA and calibrated to confirmed cases, deaths (overall and by age) and epidemic peak timing. Adjunctive prevention interventions were simulated assuming different levels of pre-COVID physical interactions (pC_PI) restored. We made several predictions related to adjunctive interventions or increased pC_PI. Results The best model fit estimated ~35% pC_PI under lockdown. Gradually restoring 75% pC_PI for all age groups between May 15-July 15 resulted in ~350 daily deaths by early September 2020. Maintaining less than 45% pC_PI was required with current testing practices to ensure low levels of daily infections and deaths. If widespread community transmission persisted, isolating the elderly does not lower daily death rates significantly. Increased testing, isolation of symptomatic infections, and contact tracing permitted 60% pC_PI without significant increases in daily deaths before September, although this strategy may not be sufficient to eliminate community transmission. This combination strategy also allowed opening of schools with <15 daily deaths. Inpatient antiviral treatment reduces deaths significantly without lowering cases or hospitalizations. Conclusions We predict that widespread implementation of \"test and isolate\" policy alone is insufficient to prevent the rapid re-emergence of SARS CoV-2 without moderate physical distancing. However, widespread testing, contact tracing and case isolation would allow relaxation of physical distancing, as well as opening of schools, without a surge in local cases and deaths.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chloe Bracis","author_inst":"Ifremer, France"},{"author_name":"Eileen Burns","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"Mia Moore","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"David Swan","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"Daniel B Reeves","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Schiffer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Dobromir T Dimitrov","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Bezawit Hailegiorgis","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Eyasu Tigabu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Sabit Ababor Sr.","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ketema Bizuwork","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Assefa Deressa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Geremew Tasew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Addisu kebede","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Daniel Melese","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Andargachew Gashu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kirubel Eshetu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Adamu Tayachew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Mesfin Wossen","author_inst":"mesfinwossen@gmail.com"},{"author_name":"Abduilhafiz Hassen","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Shambel Habebe","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zewdu Assefa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Aschalew Abayneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tollera","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20168088","rel_title":"Robust, reproducible clinical patterns in hospitalised patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20168088","rel_abs":"Background Severe COVID-19 is characterised by fever, cough, and dyspnoea. Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. However, it is the clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms which influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. In this study, we applied simple machine learning techniques to a large prospective cohort of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 to identify clinically meaningful sub-groups. Methods We obtained structured clinical data on 59 011 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 25 477 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 33 534 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in 4 445 cases recruited to a separate study of community cases. Findings Unsupervised clustering identified distinct sub-groups. First, a core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea, which co-occurred with additional symptoms in three further patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were also identified, alongside a subgroup of patients reporting few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis within the ISARIC-4C study. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4 445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. Interpretation The large scale of the ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom group: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan E Millar","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Lucile Neyton","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sohan Seth","author_inst":"Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"National Infection Service, Public Health England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Laura Merson","author_inst":"ISARIC Global Support Centre, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Srinivas Murthy","author_inst":"BC Childrens Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sean Keating","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Maaike Swets","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Carole H Sudre","author_inst":"School of Biomedical and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Spector","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"ZOE Global Ltd., London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Annemarie B Docherty","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Semple","author_inst":"NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Shambel Habebe","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zewdu Assefa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Aschalew Abayneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tollera","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175240","rel_title":"The limits of estimating COVID-19 intervention effects using Bayesian models","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175240","rel_abs":"To limit the rapid spread of COVID-19, most governments have introduced different non-pharmaceutical interventions, which might have severe costs for society.

This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Several use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these novel, nucleic acid based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. We describe a monomeric, glycan engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 200mg\/L in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100{degrees}C when lyophilized, and upto 70{degrees}C in solution. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59 like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic. These features of high yield, extreme thermotolerance and satisfactory immunogenicity suggest that such RBD subunit vaccine formulations hold great promise to combat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sameer Kumar Malladi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Randhir Singh","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Pandey","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Savitha Gayathri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Kawkab Kanjo","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Shahbaz Ahmed","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Suhail Khan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Parismita Kalita","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Girish","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Aditya Upadhyaya","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Poorvi Reddy","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Ishika Pramanick","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Munmun Bhasin","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Shailendra Mani","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, India"},{"author_name":"Sankar Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, India"},{"author_name":"Jeswin Joseph","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram (IISER TVM), Kerala, India."},{"author_name":"Karthika Thankamani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram (IISER TVM), Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"V.

Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from ten COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb CV07-209 neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 of 3.1 ng\/ml. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 [A] revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jakob Kreye","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"S Momsen Reincke","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Hans-Christian Kornau","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Elisa Sanchez-Sendin","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite -

The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral\/intranasal\/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral\/intranasal\/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David A Meekins","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Igor Morozov","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Jessie D Trujillo","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Natasha N Gaudreault","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Dashzeveg Bold","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Bianca L Artiaga","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Sabarish V Indran","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Taeyong Kwon","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Velmurugan Balaraman","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Daniel W Madden","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamie Henningson","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA and Department of Veterinary Pathobi"},{"author_name":"Udeni B.R.

Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria G Noval","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria E Kaczmarek","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Koide","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bruno A Rodriguez-Rodriguez","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ping Louie","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takuya Tada","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takamitsu Hattori","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Panchenko","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Larizbeth A Romero","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kai Wen Teng","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bazley","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maren de Vries","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Weiser","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Aifantis","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joan Cangiarella","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ludovic Desvignes","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Meike Dittmann","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel R Landau","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria E Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Shohei Koide","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth A Stapleford Jr.","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Paula Charlotte Barthel","author_inst":"Charite -

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K\/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K\/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siqi Wu","author_inst":"1.
