As no approved therapeutics exists to treat Covid-19, the disease associated to SARS-Cov-2, there is an urgent need to propose molecules that could quickly enter into clinics. Repurposing of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time consuming stages of drug development. In this study, we screened the Prestwick Chemical Library(R) composed of 1,520 approved drugs in an infected cell-based assay. 90 compounds were identified. The robustness of the screen was assessed by the identification of drugs, such as Chloroquine derivatives and protease inhibitors, already in clinical trials. The hits were sorted according to their chemical composition and their known therapeutic effect, then EC50 and CC50 were determined for a subset of compounds. Several drugs, such as Azithromycine, Opipramol, Quinidine or Omeprazol present antiviral potency with 2<EC50<20{micro}M.

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yifei Lang","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Wentao Li","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Zeshi Li","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences and Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Utrecht Universit"},{"author_name":"Danielle Koerhuis","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Arthur C.S. van den Burg","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Erik Rozemuller","author_inst":"GenDx B.V., Yalelaan 48, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Berend-Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the +RNA virus family that utilize single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteins - the matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) - and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD lined with arginine residues suggesting a putative RNA binding site. Next, we performed an NMR titration experiment using an RNA duplex. The observed changes in positions of signals in the N-NTD NMR spectra allowed us to construct a model of the N-NTD in complex with RNA.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhurvas Chandrasekaran Dinesh","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Dominika Chalupska","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Jan Silhan","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Vaclav Veverka","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Evzen Boura","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Erik Rozemuller","author_inst":"GenDx B.V., Yalelaan 48, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Berend-Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

The receptor recognition of ACE2 protein by SARS-CoVs or bat-originated coronaviruses is one of the most important determinant factors for the cross-species transmission and human-to-human transmission. To explore the hypothesis of possible intermediate animal host, we employed molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation to examine the binding of bat coronavirus with ACE2 proteins of 47 representing animal species collected from public databases. Our results suggest that intermediate animal host may exist for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we found that tree shrew and ferret may be two putative intermediate hosts for the zoonotic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the continuous surveillance of pneumonia in human and suspicious animal hosts are crucial to control the zoonotic transmission events caused by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Chu","author_inst":"Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhichen Gao","author_inst":"Dalian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ruiqi Cai","author_inst":"Dalian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sijin Wu","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaolin Sun","author_inst":"Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Chen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Yongliang Yang","author_inst":"Dalian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro.\n\nThe main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2 is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ernesto Estrada","author_inst":"Institute of Mathematics and Applications, University of Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Simone Marini","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Mattia Prosperi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Sijin Wu","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaolin Sun","author_inst":"Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Chen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Yongliang Yang","author_inst":"Dalian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

Moreover, cellular ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S protein cleavage) levels did not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles. Thus, only drug testing using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates. Therapeutic concentrations of the approved protease inhibitor aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The efficacy of aprotinin and of remdesivir (currently under clinical investigation against SARS-CoV-2) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold).

Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable \"choke points\" for pharmacologic interventions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving rapid refinements with a two-to-four week release cycle. In a sustained community effort, this consortium is integrating data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Getz","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Yafei Wang","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Gary An","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Becker","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chase Cockrell","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholson Collier","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory, University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Morgan Craig","author_inst":"University of Montreal, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Courtney L.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data. Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of disease prevalence.

The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with greater strength than LPV. ATV blocked Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary monocytes, impairing virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and TNF- levels. Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV\/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia Fintelman-Rodrigues","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Carolina Q Sacramento","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Carlyle Ribeiro Lima","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Franklin Souza da Silva","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Andre Ferreira","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Mayara Mattos","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Caroline S. de Freitas","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Vinicius Cardoso Soares","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Suelen da Silva Gomes Dias","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Jairo R.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.\n\nImportanceVirus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuesen Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Shuangli Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Danying Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Mei Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Guoli Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Hanxin Lin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Western University, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Ontario, Canada."},{"author_name":"Jinhong Chang","author_inst":"Baruch S.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL\/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes).\n\nWe have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL\/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug..\n\nAmantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sandra Smieszek","author_inst":"Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Bart Przychodzen","author_inst":"Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Mihael H Polymeropoulos","author_inst":"Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Douglas W.

Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar \"GA\" rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neha Periwal","author_inst":"Jamai Hamdard"},{"author_name":"Sankritya Sarma","author_inst":"Hansraj College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pooja Arora","author_inst":"Hansraj College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vikas Sood","author_inst":"Jamia Hamdard"},{"author_name":"Zichen Zhou","author_inst":"United Animal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoli Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Hanxin Lin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Western University, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Ontario, Canada."},{"author_name":"Jinhong Chang","author_inst":"Baruch S.

We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs\/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs\/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs\/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs\/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs\/ACEIs or non-ARBs\/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs\/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, much lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs\/ACEIs group than non-ARBs\/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs\/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Zihu Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhou","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Basic Medicine, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jinjin Liu","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jingling Cai","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ru Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Junyan Han","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yafei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaobin He","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aline R.

Along with the anxiety scores, limited personal information such as age, gender, region, education, occupation and specifically, the type and duration of quarantine were collected for analysis. For a total number of 992 valid questionnaires, clinical significance of anxiety symptoms was observed in 9.58% respondents according to clinical diagnostic standards in China. Statistical results showed population with different age, education level, health status and personnel category responded differently. Other characteristics such as gender, marital status, region, and acquaintance with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 did not affect anxiety levels significantly. Respondents experienced different forms of quarantine showed different anxiety levels. Unexpectedly, longer durations of quarantine did not lead to significant increase of anxiety level.

However, infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID-19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction. Methods: We searched the terms \"COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2\" AND \"Pediatric OR children\" on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC. Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not usually show the lesions or the detailed features. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and\/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and\/or; lactate progressively increasing and\/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and\/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection\/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Li","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Kun Qian","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Ling-ling Xie","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Xiu-juan Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Min Cheng","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Bjoern W.

While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The substantial number of patients with severe disease have strained intensive care capacities to an unprecedented level. Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13\/40 (32.5%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10-5). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg\/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10-8, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of [&ge;] 80 pg\/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial. Our study shows that IL-6 is an effective marker that might be able to predict upcoming respiratory failure with high accuracy and help physicians correctly allocate patients at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tobias Herold","author_inst":"University Hospital, LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Vindi Jurinovic","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chiara Arnreich","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes C Hellmuth","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael von Bergwelt-Baildon","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Klein","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Weinberger","author_inst":"Department of Medicine I, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ru Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Junyan Han","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yafei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaobin He","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aline R.

A cost effective and efficient diagnostic tool as near to the point of care (PoC) as possible would be a game changer in current testing. We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 minutes, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. Methods: This service improvement project piloted a research RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents in an NHS Category 1 care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a single RT-LAMP swab compared to RT-PCR, as per STARD guidelines. We also recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information. Findings: The novel method accurately detected 8\/10 PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a 'gold standard', the sensitivity and specificity of the novel test were 80% and 73% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. We also observed hypothermia to be a significant early clinical sign in a number of COVID-19 patients in this setting. Interpretation: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. Definitive studies to evaluate this method in larger cohorts are underway. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the point of care. This method could be deployed in mobile testing units in the community, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc F Osterdahl","author_inst":"Department of Ageing & Health, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Karla A Lee","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mary Ni Lochlainn","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Stuart Wilson","author_inst":"MicrosensDx Ltd, 2 Royal College Street, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Department of Infection, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Rachel Horsfall","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alyce Sheedy","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Simon D Goldenberg","author_inst":"Department of Infection, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Christoper J Stanley","author_inst":"MicrosensDx Ltd, 2 Royal College Street, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim D Spector","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Aline R.

Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required as the number of cases imported from other countries is increasing.","rel_num_authors":41,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Lu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and

Wuhan","rel_date":"2020-04-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20043794","rel_abs":"Recent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a global pandemic cross the world. Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicentre or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that can access effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. It extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations to 119610, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Its success heavily relied on sufficiently external support from other places of China. This mode were not suitable to other countries that have no sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a large portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home and did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak. One limitation of our model was that our prediction of infections and deaths depended on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. It assumed that each intervention had equivalent effects on the reproduction number R in different regions over time.
