However, robust estimates are limited, with scientific focus on the time-insensitive basic reproduction number R0. Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we consistently estimate that European COVID-19 cases doubled every three days when unconstrained, with the impact of physical distancing interventions typically seen about nine days after implementation, during which time cases grew eight-fold. The combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries' response better than large values of R0 alone, and warns against relaxing physical distancing measures too quickly. Testing and tracing are fundamental in shortening such delays, thus preventing cases from escalating unnoticed.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Francesca Scarabel","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Helena B Stage","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Christopher E Overton","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Lauren H K Chappell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Lythgoe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Fearon","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jacob Curran-Sebastian","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Rajenki Das","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Martyn Fyles","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hugo Lewkowicz","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Pang","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Bindu Vekaria","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Luke Webb","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas A House","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060632","rel_title":"FFP-2 respirator masks in times of crisis","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060632","rel_abs":"Given the current shortage of respirator masks and the resulting lack of personal protective equipment for use by clinical staff, we examined bottom-up solutions that would allow hospitals to fabricate respirator masks that: (i) meet requirements in terms of filtering capacities, (ii) are easy to produce rapidly and locally, and (iii) can be constructed using materials commonly available in hospitals worldwide. We found that Halyard H300 material used for wrapping of surgical instruments and routinely available in hospitals, met these criteria. Specifically, three layers of material achieved a filter efficiency of 94%, 99%, and 100% for 0.3 um, 0.5 um, and 3.0 um particles, respectively; importantly, these values are close to the efficiency provided by FFP2 and N95 masks. After re-sterilization up to 5 times, the filter's efficiency remains sufficiently high for use as an FFP1 respirator mask. Finally, using only one layer of the material satisfies the criteria for use as a 'surgical mask'. This material can therefore be used to help protect hospital staff and other healthcare professionals who require access to suitable masks but lack commercially available solutions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johanna H.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and often leads to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and death in the elderly and subjects with pre-existing conditions, but the reason for this age dependence is unclear. Here, we found that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in Italy, Spain, South Korea, and China, with the doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality. In addition, men and those with multiple age-related diseases are characterized by increased mortality. Moreover, similar mortality patterns were found for all-cause pneumonia. We further report that the gene expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, grows in the lung with age, except for subjects on a ventilator. Together, our findings establish COVID-19 as an emergent disease of aging, and age and age-related diseases as its major risk factors. In turn, this suggests that COVID-19, and deadly respiratory diseases in general, may be targeted, in addition to therapeutic approaches that affect specific pathways, by approaches that target the aging process.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Didac Santesmasses","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Pedro Castro","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aleksandr A Zenin","author_inst":"Lomonosov Moscow State University"},{"author_name":"Anastasia V Shindyapina","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maxim V Gerashchenko","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bohan Zhang","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Csaba Kerepesi","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sun Hee Yim","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter O Fedichev","author_inst":"Lomonosov Moscow State University"},{"author_name":"Vadim N Gladyshev","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martyn Fyles","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hugo Lewkowicz","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Pang","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Bindu Vekaria","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Luke Webb","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas A House","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.040667","rel_title":"COVID-19 Knowledge Graph: a computable, multi-modal, cause-and-effect knowledge model of COVID-19 pathophysiology","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.040667","rel_abs":"SummaryThe past few weeks have witnessed a worldwide mobilization of the research community in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world, a typical founder effect. The genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivair Jose Morais Junior","author_inst":"Universidade de Brasilia"},{"author_name":"Richard Costa Polveiro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Vicosa"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Medeiros Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Daniel Inserra Bortolin","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Flavio Tetsuo Sassaki","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Alison Talis Martins Lima","author_inst":"Unversidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Christian Ebeling","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Vadim N Gladyshev","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martyn Fyles","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hugo Lewkowicz","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Pang","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Bindu Vekaria","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Luke Webb","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas A House","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.041228","rel_title":"The FDA-approved gold drug Auranofin inhibits novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) replication and attenuates inflammation in human cells","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.041228","rel_abs":"SARS-COV-2 has recently emerged as a new public health threat.

The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target. Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins. With the limited number of sequences this was the only frequent novel non-synonymous change observed from Indian strains, thereby making this change vulnerable for investigation in future. This paper has a special focus on tracking of Indian viral sequences submitted in public domain.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditi Joshi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Paul","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur"},{"author_name":"Janhavi Natekar","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Pratima Kumari","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Komal Arora","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Mukesh Kumar","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Christian Ebeling","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Vadim N Gladyshev","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martyn Fyles","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hugo Lewkowicz","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Pang","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Bindu Vekaria","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Luke Webb","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas A House","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.041434","rel_title":"Genetic Variability of Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) Among Various Ethnic Populations","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.041434","rel_abs":"There appears to be large regional variations for susceptibility, severity and mortality for Covid-19 infections.

In-depth analyses of autophagy signaling and metabolomics indicate that SARS-CoV-2 reduces glycolysis and protein translation by limiting activation of AMP-protein activated kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Infection also downregulates autophagy-inducing spermidine, and facilitates AKT1\/SKP2-dependent degradation of autophagy-initiating Beclin-1 (BECN1). Targeting of these pathways by exogenous administration of spermidine, AKT inhibitor MK-2206, and the Beclin-1 stabilizing, antihelminthic drug niclosamide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation by 85, 88, and >99%, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for treating COVID-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and vaccines.\n\nIn order for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the proprotein convertase furin at the S1\/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2 site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication.\n\nOur data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dorothea Bestle","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Miriam Ruth Heindl","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hannah Limburg","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thuy Van Lam van","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pilgram","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hong Moulton","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA"},{"author_name":"David A.

Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively).

Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1\/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation.

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome.\n\nMethodsHere, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene.\n\nResultsWe identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.\n\nConclusionOur study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tayaza Fadason","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Sreemol Gokuladhas","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Evgeniia Golovina","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ho","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Sophie Farrow","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Denis M Nyaga","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Hong Pan","author_inst":"Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)"},{"author_name":"Neerja Karnani","author_inst":"Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)"},{"author_name":"Conroy Wong","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Middlemore Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antony Cooper","author_inst":"Australian Parkinsons Mission, Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"William Schierding","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Catharine Bosio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Sarah Anzick","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.036285","rel_title":"Genome based Evolutionary study of SARS-CoV-2 towards the Prediction of Epitope Based Chimeric Vaccine","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.036285","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems of human and has already become an unprecedented threat to global healthcare system. COVID-19, the most serious public condition caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved vaccine has made the recovery of COVI-19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins (S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis. Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID-19. The designed constructs were characterized based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and Normal Mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level. In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein. Molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct V3 and HLA cells, as well as with different host receptors. Microbial expression and translational efficacy of the constructs were checked using pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. The development of preventive measures to combat COVID-19 infections might be aided the present study. However, the in vivo and in vitro validation might be ensured with wet lab trials using model animals for the implementation of the presented data.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mst Rubaiat Nazneen Akhand","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Kazi Faizul Azim","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Syeda Farjana Hoque","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Mahmuda Akther Moli","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Bijit Das Joy","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Akter","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural university"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Khalil Afif","author_inst":"Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Nadim Ahmed","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Mahmudul Hasan","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Antony Cooper","author_inst":"Australian Parkinsons Mission, Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"William Schierding","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Catharine Bosio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Sarah Anzick","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.042010","rel_title":"Humanized Single Domain Antibodies Neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by Targeting Spike Receptor Binding Domain","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.042010","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across more than 200 countries and regions, leading to an unprecedented medical burden and live lost.

In humans, it binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the help a structural protein on its surface called the S-spike. Further, cleavage of the viral spike protein (S) by the proteases like transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) or Cathepsin L (CTSL) is essential to effectuate host cell membrane fusion and virus infectivity. COVID-19 poses intriguing issues with imperative relevance to clinicians. The pathogenesis of GI symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases. Tissue specific variations of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry related receptors expression in healthy individuals can help in understanding the pathophysiological basis the aforementioned collection of symptoms.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe data were downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas available at (https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/humanproteome\/sars-cov-2) and the tissue specific expressions (both mRNA and protein) of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as yielded from the studies with RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were analyzed as a function of the various components of the digestive tract. A digestive system specific functional enrichment map of ACE2 gene was created using g:profiler (https:\/\/biit.cs.ut.ee\/gprofiler\/gost) utility and the data were visualized using Cytoscape software, version 3.7.2 (https:\/\/cytoscape.org\/).\n\nResultsThe correlated expression (transcriptomic and proteomic) of ACE2 (to which SARS-CoV-2 binds through the S-spike) was found to be enriched in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (highest in small intestine, followed by colon and rectum), and was undetectable in the upper GIT components: mouth cavity (tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary glands), esophagus, and stomach. High expression of ACE2 was noted in the glandular cells as well as in the enterocytes in the lining epithelium (including brush border epithelium). Among other digestive system organs, Gall bladder (GB) showed high expression of ACE2 in glandular cells, while any protein expression was undetectable in liver and pancreas. TMPRSS2 was found enhanced in GIT and exocrine glands of pancreas, and co-localized with ACE2 in enterocytes.\n\nConclusionsBased on the findings of this study and supportive evidence from the literature we propose that a SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 mediates dysregulation of the sodium dependent nutrient transporters and hence may be a plausible basis for the digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1 or SLC5A1) in the intestinal epithelium also links it to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus which can be a possible reason for the associated mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. High expression of ACE2 in mucosal cells of the intestine and GB make these organs potential sites for the virus entry and replication. Continued replication of the virus at these ACE2 enriched sites may be a basis for the disease recurrence reported in some, thought to be cured, patients.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Etiologically Elusive Disorders Research Network (EEDRN)","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Anatomy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, India"},{"author_name":"Muneeb A.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes conserved RNA elements that offer potential targets for RNA-targeting small-molecule drugs, but 3D structures of most of these elements have not been experimentally characterized. Here, we provide a dataset called  FARFAR2-SARS-CoV-2, a collection of 3D coordinates modeled using Rosettas FARFAR2 algorithm, including de novo models for thirteen RNA elements in SARS-CoV-2 and homology models for a fourteenth. These elements comprise SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, SL5, putative SL6 and SL7 in the extended 5' UTR, as well as the entire extended 5' UTR; the frameshifting element (FSE) from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a\/b gene and a putative dimer of FSE; and the extended pseudoknot, hypervariable region, and the s2m of the 3' UTR, as well as the entire 3' UTR. For five of these elements (SL1, SL2, SL3, FSE, s2m), convergence of lowest predicted energy structures supports their accuracy in capturing low energy states that might be targeted for small molecule binding. To aid efforts to discover small molecule RNA binders guided by computational models, we provide a second benchmarking dataset called  FARFAR2-Apo-Riboswitch, which consists of similarly prepared Rosetta-FARFAR2 models for RNA riboswitch aptamer regions that bind small molecules. Both datasets include up to 400 3D models for each RNA element, which may facilitate drug discovery approaches targeting dynamic ensembles of low-energy excited states of RNA molecules.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramya Rangan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M.

Design: Observational, descriptive study of ICUs monitored by a tele-ICU system across Northwell Health. Inclusion criteria: All patients admitted to Northwell Health tele-ICUs during 2019 and between March 23, 2020 and April 6, 2020. Exposure: A data extract was developed to collect data every hour for each ICU bed in the Northwell tele-critical care program as a quality reporting initiative to understand ICU capacity and resource utilization. A similar extract was developed for each hour of 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average of any given hour during the pre-COVID-19 and pandemic periods for the following metrics: proportion of beds occupied, proportion of ventilated patients, severity of illness (measured by the ICU Discharge Readiness Score (DRS)), and length of stay (LOS). Results: Hourly analysis of data from 186 ICU beds from 14 ICUs and 9 hospitals were included, representing 10,714 patients in 2019 and 465 patients between March 23 and April 6, 2020. Average hourly occupancy increased from 64% to 78%, while the proportion of patients invasively ventilated increased from 33.9% to 84.2%. Median DRS (severity of illness score) increased from 1.08 (IQR: 0.24-6.98) to 39.38 (IQR: 12.00-71.28). Proportion of patients with Hispanic ethnicity doubled (7.8% to 16.6%; p<0.01) and proportion of female patients decreased from 46.3% to 32.9% (p<0.01). Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to the expected increase in ICU occupancy and ventilator requirements, this large group of ICUs in midst of the COVID-19 epidemic are faced with managing a cohort of ICU patients with a dramatically higher severity of illness than their typical census.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Badawi","author_inst":"Philips Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Xinggang Liu","author_inst":"Philips Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Iris Berman","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Amelung","author_inst":"Philips Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Martin Doerfler","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Chandra","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Pranav Prasoon","author_inst":"Pittsburgh Center for Pain Research, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Pavan Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA"},{"author_name":"Maheswari Kulandhasamy","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Chiman Kumari","author_inst":"Department of Anatomy, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Kamla Kant","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhatinda, India"},{"author_name":"Himanshu N.

When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0=2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively.

The outbreak has a significant threat to international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19. Method and analysis: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random\/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo. Ethics and dissemination: This study does not require ethical approval, because no participants data will be involved in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings of this study will be published in reputable and peer-reviewed journal. Registration: This review protocol is submitted in PROSPERO database for registration and we will include the registration number in the revised version of the manuscript.

The accuracy of early diagnosis is critical in the control of the spread of the virus. Although the real-time RT-PCR detection of the virus nucleic acid is the current golden diagnostic standard, it has high false negative rate when only apply single test. Objective Summarize the baseline characteristics and laboratory examination results of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analyze the factors that could interfere with the early diagnosis quantitatively to support the timely confirmation of the disease. Methods All suspected patients with COVID-19 were included in our study until Feb 9th, 2020. The last day of follow-up was Mar 20th, 2020. Throat swab real-time RT-PCR test was used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. The difference between the epidemiological profile and first laboratory examination results of COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were compared and analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to assess the potential diagnostic value in factors, which had statistical differences in regression analysis. Results In total, 315 hospitalized patients were included. Among them, 108 were confirmed as COVID-19 patients and 207 were non-COVID-19 patients. Two groups of patients have significance in comparing age, contact history, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.10). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, contact history and decreasing lymphocyte count could be used as individual factor that has diagnostic value (p<0.05). The AUC of first RT-PCR test was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), AUC of cumulative two times of RT-PCR tests was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for cumulative three times of RT-PCR tests. Ninety-six patients showed typical pneumonia radiological features in first CT scan, AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.73). The AUC of patients age, contact history with confirmed people and the decreased lymphocytes were 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), 0.67 (95% CI 0.61-0.73), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), respectively. Taking chest CT scan diagnosis together with patients age and decreasing lymphocytes, AUC would be 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90). The age threshold to predict COVID-19 was 41.5 years, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79) and a specificity of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.66). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.71 and 0.50, respectively. Threshold of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19 was 1.53x109\/L, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.88) and a specificity of 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.64 and 0.37, respectively. Conclusion Single RT-PCR test has relatively high false negative rate. When first RT-PCR test show negative result in suspected patients, the chest CT scan, contact history, age and lymphocyte count should be used combinedly to assess the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinwei Ai","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junyan Gong","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Limin Xing","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Renjiao He","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fangtao Tian","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Wang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengduo Polo Pei","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"Leiden University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Huang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059758","rel_title":"A Scalable Method of Applying Heat and Humidity for Decontamination of N95 Respirators During the COVID-19 Crisis","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059758","rel_abs":"A lack of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 crisis has placed healthcare workers at risk.

We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lo\u00efc Anderegg","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Cole Meisenhelder","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Chiu Oan Ngooi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Lei Liao","author_inst":"4C Air"},{"author_name":"Wang Xiao","author_inst":"4C air"},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"John M Doyle","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"Leiden University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Huang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059261","rel_title":"COVID-19 in India: Predictions, Reproduction Number and Public Health Preparedness","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059261","rel_abs":"Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 has emerged as a global concern for public health due to large scale outbreak. The number of confirmed cases has also been increased in India in the past few weeks. The predictions for the COVID-19 can provide insights into the epidemiology of the disease, which helps policymakers to check health system capacities. Methods: We obtained data on daily confirmed, recovered and death cases for a period of 21 days and have implemented the exponential growth model to predict future cases for all the three components. The mathematical model was used to calculate the average reproduction number and herd immunity. We estimated the number of active cases till the 30th of April. We have also tried to analyze the public health capacity to combat COVID-19 in India. Results: If the exponential growth in the number of cases continues then the total number of active cases will be 2,49,635 until the end of April. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity as 61%. The cumulative cases predicted by the mathematical model was 1,20,203. Discussion: This prediction provides an alarming situation for India in terms of public health preparedness. The number of tests is needed to increase to detect all the cases of COVID-19 in India. Though some serious preventive measures have been implemented, but India should be ready to face any sudden community outbreak.

We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national\/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pengcheng Xu","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Tan","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanujit Chakraborty","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Tan","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya. Methods We developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak. Results We find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 - 2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel P C Brand","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Rabia Aziza","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Ivy K Kombe","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Charles N Agoti","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Kat S Rock","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Andrea Parisi","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"D James Nokes","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme and University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Matt Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059832","rel_title":"Standardization and Age-Distribution of COVID-19: Implications for Variability in Case Fatality and Outbreak Identification","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059832","rel_abs":"Background: Epidemiological data from the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated variability in attack rates by age, and country-to-country variability in case fatality ratio (CFR). Objective: To use direct and indirect standardization for insights into the impact of age-specific under-reporting on between-country variability in CFR, and apparent size of COVID-19 epidemics. Design: Post-hoc secondary data analysis (case studies), and mathematical modeling. Setting: China, global. Interventions: None. Measurements: Data were extracted from a sentinel epidemiological study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) that describes attack rates and CFR for COVID-19 in China prior to February 12, 2020. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. Age-specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak recognition for identical age-specific attack rates. Results: SMR demonstrated that 50-70% of cases were likely missed during the Chinese epidemic. Adjustment for under-recognition of younger cases decreased CFR from 2.4% to 0.8% (assuming 50% case ascertainment in older individuals). Standardizing the Chinese epidemic to countries with older populations (Italy, and Japan) resulted in larger apparent epidemic sizes, higher CFR and earlier outbreak recognition. The opposite effect was demonstrated for countries with younger populations (Indonesia, and Egypt). Limitations: Secondary data analysis based on a single country at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no attempt to incorporate second order effects (ICU saturation) on CFR. Conclusion: Direct and indirect standardization are simple tools that provide key insights into between-country variation in the apparent size and severity of COVID-19 epidemics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Charles N Agoti","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Kat S Rock","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Andrea Parisi","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"D James Nokes","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme and University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Matt Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
