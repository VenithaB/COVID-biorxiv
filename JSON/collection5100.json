Due to this extremely recent association with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may not yet be fully adapted to its human host. This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral. Recurrent mutations also seem primarily induced by the human immune system via host RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaptation to the novel human host. In conclusion, we find no evidence at this stage for the emergence of significantly more transmissible lineages of SARS-CoV-2 due to recurrent mutations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucy van Dorp","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Damien Richard","author_inst":"Cirad"},{"author_name":"Cedric CS Tan","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Liam P.

Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Here, we devised a model that estimates the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions regarding age, gender, presence of prior medical conditions, general feeling, and the symptoms fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and loss of taste or smell, all of which have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel over the past 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. We successfully validated the model on held-out individuals from Israel where it achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 46.3% at a 10% sensitivity and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel by further validating it on an independently collected symptom survey dataset from the U.K., U.S. and Sweden, where it achieved a PPV of 34.7% at 10% sensitivity. Moreover, evaluating the model's performance on this latter independent dataset on entries collected one week prior to the PCR test and up to the day of the test we found the highest performance on the day of the test. As our tool can be used online and without the need of exposure to suspected patients, it may have worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified and isolated.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saar Shoer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tal Karady","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Hagai Rossman","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amir Gavrieli","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tomer Meir","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amit Lavon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Kolobkov","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Carole Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105783","rel_title":"How many patients will need ventilators tomorrow?","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105783","rel_abs":"This paper develops an algorithm to predict the number of Covid-19 patients who will start to use ventilators tomorrow.

We predict symptoms' incidence using binomial models for spatially discrete data, and we introduce these as a covariate in the spatial analysis of COVID-19 incidence, as reported by the Belgian government during the days following a survey round. The symptoms' incidence predictions explain a significant proportion of the variation in the relative risks based on the confirmed cases, and exceedance probability maps of the symptoms' incidence and the confirmed cases' relative risks pinpoint the same high-risk region.

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. Methods To find out the risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence, a negative binomial design was applied to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Results 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P<0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median and high prevalence counties . The segregation between non-Whites and Whites and higher Hispanic population had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties. Conclusions The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race\/ethnicity, and outdoor environment. The increasing awareness of the impact of these significant factors may lead to the reduction in the mortality of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liyuan Hu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Congyuan Duan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhongfei Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Beutels","author_inst":"University of Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Carole Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105494","rel_title":"Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Covid-19 versus Patients with Influenza","rel_date":"2020-05-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105494","rel_abs":"Importance: Case series without control groups suggest that Covid-19 may cause ischemic stroke, but whether Covid-19 is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke than would be expected from a viral respiratory infection is uncertain. Objective: To compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with Covid-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously linked to stroke. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Setting: Two academic hospitals in New York City. Participants: We included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 from March 4, 2020 through May 2, 2020. Our comparison cohort included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with influenza A or B from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018 (calendar years spanning moderate and severe influenza seasons). Exposures: Covid-19 infection confirmed by evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharynx by polymerase chain reaction, and laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B. Main Outcomes and Measures: A panel of neurologists adjudicated the primary outcome of acute ischemic stroke and its clinical characteristics, etiological mechanisms, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of Covid-19 patients with ischemic stroke versus the proportion among patients with influenza. Results: Among 2,132 patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19, 31 patients (1.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0%-2.1%) had an acute ischemic stroke. The median age of patients with stroke was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-78) and 58% were men. Stroke was the reason for hospital presentation in 8 (26%) cases. For our comparison cohort, we identified 1,516 patients with influenza, of whom 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0-0.6%) had an acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was significantly higher with Covid-19 than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.3-24.9). Conclusions and Relevance: Approximately 1.5% of patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 experienced ischemic stroke, a rate 7.5-fold higher than in patients with influenza. Future studies should investigate the thrombotic mechanisms in Covid-19 in order to determine optimal strategies to prevent disabling complications like ischemic stroke.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander E.

In case of COVID-19 this spreading behaviour is quantitatively better described with a mobility-driven SIR-SEIR model [2] rather than the homogenous mixing models. Lockdown has dramatically slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in UK, and even more significantly, has changed the growth in the total number of infected from exponential to quadratic. This significant change is due to a transition from a mobility-driven epidemic spreading to a spatial epidemic which is dominated by slow growth of spatially isolated clusters of infected population. Our results strongly indicate that, to avoid a return to exponential growth of COVID-19 (also known as second wave), mobility restrictions should not be prematurely lifted. Instead mobility should be kept restricted while new measures, such as wearing of masks and contact tracing, get implemented in order to prevent health services becoming overwhelmed due to a resurgence of exponential growth.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maziar Nekovee","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Felix Mairanowski","author_inst":"Husmann"},{"author_name":"Mohammed A.

We report the main features of the development of a novel freely accessible model intended to urgently help researchers and decision makers to predict the evolution of the pandemic in their country. Methods and findings We built a SIR-type compartmental model with additional compartments and features. We made the hypothesis that the number of contagious individuals in the population was negligible as compared to the population size. We introduced a compartment D corresponding to the deceased patients and a compartment L representing the group of individuals who will die but who will not infect anybody (due to social or medical isolation). Our model integrated a time-dependent transmission rate, whose variations can be thought to be related to the public measures taken by each country and a cosine function to incorporate a periodic weekly component linked to the way in which numbers of cases and deaths are counted and reported, which can change from day to day. The model was able to accurately capture the different changes in the dynamics of the pandemic for nine different countries whatever the type of pandemic spread or containment measures. The model provided very accurate forecasts in the relatively short term (10 days). Conclusions In early evaluation of the performance of our model, we found a high level of accuracy between prediction and observed data, regardless of the country. The model should be used by the community to help public health decisions as we will refine it over time and further investigate its performance.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"Inria"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Faron","author_inst":"Gustave Roussy"},{"author_name":"jeremie lefevre","author_inst":"sorbonne universite"},{"author_name":"Jean-David Zeitoun","author_inst":"Centre Epidemiologie Clinique, Hotel Dieu"},{"author_name":"Olumuyiwa Otegbeye","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal"},{"author_name":"Queeneth O Ahman","author_inst":"University of Nigeria, Nsukka"},{"author_name":"Godwin C.

We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates amongst children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. Well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that M[a]ori and Pacific peoples are at higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing, and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Kate Hannah","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Amit K Shukla","author_inst":"University of Rennes 1, France"},{"author_name":"Haruna Chiroma","author_inst":"Future Technology Research Center, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Samuel S.

As the growth rates {lambda}(t) of tested positive COVID-19 cases have crossed the threshold in many countries, with negative numbers as surrogate for disease transmission deceleration, lockdowns lifting are linked to the behavior of the momentary reproduction numbers r(t), often called R0. Important to note that this concept alone can be easily misinterpreted as it is bound to many internal assumptions of the underlying model and significantly affected by the assumed recovery period. Here we present our experience, as part of the Basque Country Modeling Task Force (BMTF), in monitoring the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, by considering not only the behaviour of r(t) estimated for the new tested positive cases - significantly affected by the increased testing capacities, but also the momentary growth rates for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deceased and recovered cases, in assisting the Basque Health Managers and the Basque Government during the lockdown lifting measures. Two different data sets, collected and then refined during the COVID-19 responses, are used as an exercise to estimate the momentary growth rates and reproduction numbers over time in the Basque Country, and the implications of using those concepts to make decisions about easing lockdown and relaxing social distancing measures are discussed.

Hence it is important to be able to forecast hospitalizations reasonably accurately. Methods We propose on phenomenological grounds a generalized diffusion equation which in- corporates the effect of social distancing to forecast the temporal evolution of the probability of having a given number of hospitalizations. The probability density function is log-normal in the number of hospitalizations, which is useful in describing pandemics where the number of hospital- izations is very high. Findings We used this insight and data to make forecasts for states using Monte Carlo methods. Back testing validates our approach, which yields good results about a week into the future. States are beginning to reopen at the time of publication and our forecasts indicate possible precursors of increased hospitalizations. Additionally we studied the reproducibility Ro in New York (Italian strain) and California (Wuhan strain). We find that even if there is a difference in the transmission of the two strains, social distancing has been able to control the progression of COVID 19.

Methods: UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, were asked to log symptoms daily from 24th March 2020 to 23rd April 2020. Participants reporting that they did not feel physically normal were taken through a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and any hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the association between current smoking and the development of classic symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity. In addition, association of subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of ACE2, both the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and a potential mediator of disease severity, with smoking status was assessed in a subset of 541 twins from the TwinsUK cohort. Results: Data were available on 2,401,982 participants, mean(SD) age 43.6(15.1) years, 63.3% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0%. 834,437 (35%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms.

Evidence suggests that superspreaders who transmit the virus to a large number of people, play a substantial role in transmission; recent estimates suggest that about 1-20 percent of people with the virus are the source for about 80 percent of infections. We used an agent-based model to explore the interplay between social structure, mitigation and superspreading. Methods: We developed an agent-based model with a subset of superspreader agents that transmit disease far more efficiently. These agents act in a social network that allows transmission during contacts in three sectors: home, work\/school and other. We simulated the effect of various mitigation strategies that limit contacts in each of these sectors, and used the model to fit COVID-19 mortality data from Sweden. Findings: Reducing contacts in the other sector had a far greater impact on epidemic trajectory than did reducing home or work\/school contacts; this effect was substantially enhanced when the infectivity of children was reduced relative to that of adults. The model fit Swedish hospitalization data with reasonable assumptions about the effect of Sweden's mitigation policies on contacts in the different sectors.

Multiple candidate vaccines, designed to elicit protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein, are rapidly advancing to clinical trial. However, the immunogenic properties of the spike protein in humans are unresolved. To address this, we undertook an in-depth characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike in humans following mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find serological antibody responses against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising activity and capacity to block ACE2\/RBD interaction. Expanded populations of spike-specific memory B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) were detected within convalescent donors, while responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) constitute a minor fraction. Using regression analysis, we find high plasma neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody, but notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets. Thus both qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immunity to spike constitute informative biomarkers of the protective potential of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer A Juno","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Hyon-Xhi Tan","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi Lee","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Arnold Reynaldi","author_inst":"Kirby Institute, UNSW"},{"author_name":"Hannah G Kelly","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Wragg","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Robyn Esterbauer","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Helen E Kent","author_inst":"Melbourne Sexual Health Centre"},{"author_name":"C Jane Batten","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Mordant","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Gherardin","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Phillip Pymm","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Melanie H Dietrich","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nichollas E Scott","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wai-Hong Tham","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Dale I Godfrey","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Kanta Subbarao","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza"},{"author_name":"Miles P Davenport","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute, UNSW"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Kent","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Adam K Wheatley","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Cenai Zhang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Babak B.

Our results indicate that the S-, RBD-, and N- specific IgG generation of severe\/critical COVID-19 patients is one week later than mild\/moderate cases, while the levels of these antibodies are 1.5-fold higher in severe\/critical patients during hospitalization (P<0.01). The decrease of these IgG levels indicates the poor outcome of severe\/critical patients. The RBD- and S-specific IgG levels are 2-fold higher in virus-free patients (P<0.05).

Serial experiments were carried out to evaluate various factors that might affect aforementioned methodologies, such as types of virus transport mediums, methods of specimen pretreatment and template preparation, specimen vortex strength, specimen storage temperature and duration. The results showed that using {Delta}Cq values as indexes, among various factors that might affect analytical performance, it was better to store specimens in the normal saline transport mediums, inactivate pathogens using water or metal bath, release more virus particles from swabs by vortex mixing, extract nucleic acids with centrifuge methods, and perform amplification assays timely. Aforementioned opinions and optimum conditions were further confirmed by SRAS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and clinical positive specimens. Altogether, the results of this study indicated that the routine specimens from healthy individuals could be used to evaluate the analytical performance of real-time fluorescent RT-PCR targeting SRAS-CoV-2, of which the indexes were the {Delta}Cq values between IRC genes of a specimen and QC.

To allow every laboratory or hospital access to an inhouse assay, we developed two low cost SARSCoV2 detection assay protocols using inhouse primers and reagents equipment on hand in most biology or diagnostic laboratories a SYBR Green based RTPCR and PCR assays. RNA extraction has also become a major bottleneck due to limited supplies and the required labor. Thus, we validated alternative RNA extraction protocols. Methods SARSCoV2 genome sequences deposited into the GISAID database were retrieved to design and synthesize inhouse primers. Forty patient samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab, coded, and used to develop and validate the assay protocols. Both assays used TRIzol and heat-processing techniques to extract RNA from patient samples and to inactivate the virus; thus, testing was conducted in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the primers were evaluated using samples previously confirmed positive for SARSCoV2. The positive amplicons were sequenced to confirm the results. The assay protocols were developed, and the specificity of each PCR product was confirmed using melting curve analyses. The most accurate heat processing technique for primers with short amplicon lengths was 95C for 15 mins. Of 40 samples, both the SYBR Green based quantitative RTPCR assay and the PCR assay detected SARSCoV2 target genes in 28 samples, with no false positive or false-negative results. These findings were concordant with those of the diagnostic laboratory that tested the same samples using a Rotor Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARSCoV2 kit (R2=0.889). Conclusions These approaches are reliable, repeatable, specific, sensitive, simple, and low cost tools for the detection of SARSCoV2 in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory, offering alternative approaches when commercial kits are unavailable or cost ineffective.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatimah Alhamlan","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Alqahtani","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Dana Bakheet","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Marie Bohol","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Sahar Althawadi","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Maysoon Mutabagani","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Reem Almaghrabi","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Dalia Obeid","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Kun Wei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Wei-Ping Lu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Shao-Li Deng","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Qing Huang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, P.R.China."},{"author_name":"Bakwatanisa Bosco","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenhua Gan","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211166, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Qiao","author_inst":"Medical and Technical Support Department, Pingdingshan Medical District, the 989th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force, Pingdingshan, Henan, 467000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wu","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, China"},{"author_name":"qianghu wang","author_inst":"Nanjing medical university"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210006, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"Joint Expert Group for COVID-19, Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei 430100, China"},{"author_name":"Cenai Zhang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Babak B.

Since the first observations of COVID-19 patients, significant hypoalbuminemia was detected. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19 patients is due to pulmonary capillary leakage and to test its correlation with indicators of respiratory function. Methods: 174 COVID-19 patients, 92 admitted to the Intermediate Medicine ward (IMW), and 82 to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan were included in this study. Findings: Serum albumin concentration was decreased in the whole cohort, with ICU patients displaying lower values than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g\/L, p<0.0001]. Lower albumin values were found in patients belonging to a more compromised group (lower PaO2 to FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings). In a subset of 26 patients, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) highlighted high protein concentrations, which were correlated to Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-10 BALF concentration. The length of hospitalisation [20 (15-29) vs 8 (5-14) days, p<0.0001] and death rate (52.4% vs 21.7%, p<0.0001) were higher in ICU than in IMW patients, while a strict relation between hypoalbuminemia and 30 day-survival was detected in the whole cohort. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten autopsy lung tissues showed diffuse loosening of interendothelial junctional complex.

Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome secondary to the hyperinflammatory state plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction and should be regarded as a therapeutic target.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Alessandra Wu","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Fossali","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Laura Pandolfi","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Luca Carsana","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Davide Ottolina","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Frangipane","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Roberto Rech","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Antonella Tosoni","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Andrea Agarossi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Marchini","author_inst":"University of  Milan"},{"author_name":"Manuela Nebuloni","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Catena","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Qiao","author_inst":"Medical and Technical Support Department, Pingdingshan Medical District, the 989th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force, Pingdingshan, Henan, 467000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wu","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, China"},{"author_name":"qianghu wang","author_inst":"Nanjing medical university"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210006, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"Joint Expert Group for COVID-19, Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei 430100, China"},{"author_name":"Cenai Zhang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Babak B.

Lung ultrasound has been proposed to diagnose and it. However, little is known about ultrasound findings in these patients. Our aim is to present an overview of lung ultrasound characteristics in critically ill patients with SARS CoV2 pneumonia overall and in relation to the duration of symptoms and clinical parameters. Methods: On the Intensive Care Unit of two academic hospitals, adult patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 were included. Images were analyzed for pleural line characteristics, number and appearance of B-lines, BLUE-profiles (Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency), pathology in the PLAPS (Postero Lateral Alveolar and Pleural Syndrome) point and a LUS-score (lung ultrasound). The primary outcomes were frequencies, percentages and differences in lung ultrasound findings overall and between short ([&le;]14 days) and long (>14 days) duration of symptoms and their correlation with clinical parameters. Results: In this pilot observational study, 61 patients were included with 75 examinations for analysis. The most prevalent ultrasound findings were decreased lung sliding (36%), thickening of the pleural line (42%) and a C-profile per view (37%). Patients with ''long'' duration of symptoms presented more frequently with a thickened and irregular pleural line (21% (32) vs 9% (11), p=.01), C-profile per patient (47% (18) vs. 25% (8),p=.01) and pleural effusion (19% (14) vs 5% (3),p=.02) compared to patients with short duration of symptoms. Lung ultrasound findings did not correlate with P\/F ratio, fluid balance or dynamic compliance, with the exception of the LUS-score and dynamic compliance (R2=0.27, p=.02). Conclusion: SARS CoV2 results in significant ultrasound changes, with decreased lung sliding, thickening of the pleural line and a C-profile being the most observed. With time, a thickened and irregular pleural line, C-profile and pleural effusion become more common findings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Evert Haaksma","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc"},{"author_name":"Micah L.A.

This has instigated stigma among the general population as the wet market is viewed as a high-risk location for getting infected with coronavirus. Objective This study investigated the prevalence of facemask use among general population visiting the wet market. This study also investigated the demographic factors contributing to unacceptable facemask practice. Setting This prospective observational study was done among visitor to a district wet market selling range of live or freshly slaughtered animals during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Methods Individuals entering through dedicated entry point were observed for the type, category and practice of wearing personal protective equipment. Inclusion criteria for this study were any individuals entering the wet market. Subjects were categorized into two groups of acceptable and unacceptable facemask practice. The Pearson chi-square was used to test for differences in investigated variables in the univariate setting and Binary Logistic regression model was used in the multivariate setting. Main outcome measure Prevalence, acceptance practice and odds ratio of unacceptance of facemask use. Results Among 1697 individuals included in the final analysis, 1687 (99.7%) was observed wearing facemask with 1338 (78.8%) using medical-grade facemask. Among them, 1615 (95.7%) individuals facemask practice was acceptable while the reaming 72 (4.3%) individuals were observed with unacceptable facemask practice. Individuals using medical-grade facemask and high-risk age group are 6.4 times (OR=6.40; 95% CI, 2.00-20.43; p=.002) and 2.06 times practice (OR=2.06; 95% CI, 1.08-3.94; p=.028). More likely to practice unacceptable facemask use respectively. Conclusion High saturation of facemask among the general population is an adequate indicator of public hygiene measures strategy which can help to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic impact. Alarmingly, the unacceptable facemask practice among high-risk population raises the need for a targeted approach by healthcare authorities to ensure satisfactory facemask use.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gobi Hariyanayagam Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sera Selvanthan Sundram Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shargunan Selvanthan Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nur Syafina Insyirah Zaimi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nor Amirah Abdul Halim","author_inst":"Ministry of health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Jip Suzanne Nooitgedacht","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc"},{"author_name":"Carlos V.

It has prompted researchers to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus\u2019 pathways of infection, host-protein interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy, there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity. In this work, we found that 6 of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells with EC50 values ranging from 2.0 to 13 \u00b5M and selectivity indices ranging from 1.5 to &gt;10-fold. Immunofluorescence staining for LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining assays in several cell lines indicated their potency and efficacy for inhibiting autophagy correlated with the measurements in the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. Our data suggest that autophagy pathways could be targeted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and become an important component of drug combination therapies to improve the treatment outcomes for COVID-19.One Sentence Summary Blocking SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effects with selective autophagy inhibitors underlying the clinical benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirill Gorshkov","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z.

The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Kirpich","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Koniukhovskii","author_inst":"EPAM Systems"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Shvartc","author_inst":"EPAM Systems"},{"author_name":"Pavel Skums","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Thomas A.

We are employing pneumatic artificial muscles, such as air cylinders, in the reverse mode of operation to achieve mechanical ventilation. The current design of the device can operate in two modes: controlled mode and assisted mode. Unlike most ICU ventilators, our device does not need a high-pressure air pipeline to operate. With the current design, mechanical ventilation for respiration rate ranging from 10 b\/min to 30 b\/min with a tidal volume range of 150 mL to 1000 mL and I:E ratio of 1:1 to 1:5 can be performed.
