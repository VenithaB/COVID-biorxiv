A total of 102 D-values (time to obtain a log10 reduction of virus infectivity), including values for SARS-CoV-2, were collected from 26 published studies. The values obtained from the different coronaviruses and studies were found to be generally consistent. Five different models were fitted to the global dataset of D-values. The most appropriate model considered temperature and relative humidity. A spreadsheet predicting the inactivation of coronaviruses and the associated uncertainty is presented and can be used to predict virus inactivation for untested temperatures, time points or new coronavirus strains.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laurent Guillier","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Sandra Martin-Latil","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Estelle Chaix","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Anne Thebault","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pavio","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Sophie Le Poder","author_inst":"ENVA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Batejat","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Biot","author_inst":"IRBA"},{"author_name":"Lionel Koch","author_inst":"IRBA"},{"author_name":"Don Schaffner","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Moez Sanaa","author_inst":"ANSES"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20112797","rel_title":"Variation in Covid-19 Cases Across New York City","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20112797","rel_abs":"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, relative to population size, has varied greatly throughout the United States and even within the same city. In different zip codes in New York City, the epicentre of the epidemic, the number of cases per 100,000 residents has ranged from 437 to 4227, a 1:10 ratio. To guide policy decisions regarding containment and reopening of the economy, schools, and other institutions, it is vital to identify the factors that drive this large variation. This paper reports on a statistical study of incidence variation by zip code across New York City. Among many socio-economic and demographic measures considered, the average household size emerges as the single most important explanatory variable: an increase in average household size by one member increases the zip code incidence rate, in our final model specification, by at least 876 cases, 23% of the range of incidence rates, at a 95% confidence level. The percentage of the population above the age of 65, the percentage below the poverty line, and their interaction term are also strongly positively associated with zip code incidence rates, In terms of ethnic\/racial characteristics, the percentages of African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians within the population, are significantly associated, but the magnitude of the impact is considerably smaller. (The proportion of Asians within a zip code has a negative association.) These significant associations may be explained by comorbidities, known to be more (less) prevalent among the black and Hispanic (Asian) population segments. In turn, the increased prevalence of these comorbidities among the black and Hispanic population, is, in large part, the result of poorer dietary habits and more limited access to healthcare, themselves driven by lower incomes Contrary to popular belief, population density, per se, does not have a significantly positive impact. Indeed, population density and zip code incidence rates are negatively correlated, with a -33% correlation coefficient. Our model specification is based on a well-established epidemiologic model that explains the effects of household sizes on R0, the basic reproductive number of an epidemic. Our findings support implemented and proposed policies to quarantine pre-acute and post-acute patients, as well as nursing home admission policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Awi Federgruen","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sherin R Naha","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Estelle Chaix","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Anne Thebault","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pavio","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Sophie Le Poder","author_inst":"ENVA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Batejat","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Biot","author_inst":"IRBA"},{"author_name":"Lionel Koch","author_inst":"IRBA"},{"author_name":"Don Schaffner","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Moez Sanaa","author_inst":"ANSES"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114652","rel_title":"A SARS-CoV-2 serological assay to determine the presence of blocking antibodies that compete for human ACE2 binding","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114652","rel_abs":"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread around the world, there is an urgent need for new assay formats to characterize the humoral response to infection. Convalescent serum is being used for treatment and for isolation of patient-derived antibodies. However, currently there is not a simple means to estimate serum bulk neutralizing capability. Here we present an efficient competitive serological assay that can simultaneously determine an individual's seropositivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and estimate the neutralizing capacity of anti-Spike antibodies to block interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. In this ELISA-based assay, we present natively-folded viral Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then supplemented with soluble ACE2-Fc to compete for RBD-binding serum antibodies, and antibody binding quantified. Comparison of signal from untreated serum and ACE2-Fc-treated serum reveals the presence of antibodies that compete with ACE2 for RBD binding, as evidenced by loss of signal with ACE2-Fc treatment. In our test cohort of nine convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, we found all patients had developed anti-RBD antibodies targeting the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement. This assay provides a simple and high-throughput method to screen patient sera for potentially neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies to enable identification of candidate sera for therapeutic use.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James R.

Our aim was to compare the sensitivity of two testing metrics--population testing number and testing coverage--to population mortality outcomes and identify a benchmark for testing adequacy with respect to population mortality and capture of potential disease burden. This ecological study aggregated publicly available data through April 12 on testing and outcomes related to COVID-19 across 36 OECD (Organization for Economic Development) countries and Taiwan. All OECD countries and Taiwan were included in this population-based study as a proxy for countries with highly developed economic and healthcare infrastructure. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the aforementioned metrics and following outcome measures: deaths per 1 million people, case fatality rate, and case proportion of critical illness. Fractional polynomials were used to generate scatter plots to model the relationship between the testing metrics and outcomes. Testing coverage, but not population testing number, was highly correlated with population mortality (rs= -0.79, P=5.975e-09 vs rs =- 0.3, P=0.05) and case fatality rate (rs= -0.67, P=9.067e-06 vs rs = -0.21, P=0.20). A testing coverage threshold of 15-45 signified adequate testing: below 15, testing coverage was associated with exponentially increasing population mortality, whereas above 45, increased testing did not yield significant incremental mortality benefit. Testing coverage was better than population testing number in explaining country performance and can be used as an early and sensitive indicator of testing adequacy and disease burden. This may be particularly useful as countries consider re-opening their economies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Chien-Chang Lee","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Chun Hsu","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ting Hsu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Chang-Chuan Chan","author_inst":"College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Shyr-Chyr Chen","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Jen Chen","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Charles Y.

In contrast to a standard SIR model, we find that the incidence of COVID-19 spread is concave in the number of contagious individuals, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. This concave shape has a significant impact on forecasted COVID-19 cases. In particular, our model forecasts that the number of COVID cases would only have an exponential growth for a brief period at the beginning of the contagion event or right after a reopening, but would quickly settle into a prolonged period of time with stable, slightly declining levels of disease spread. This pattern is consistent with observed levels of COVID-19 cases in the US, but inconsistent with standard SIR modeling. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng Liu","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Raphael Thomadsen","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Song Yao","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ting Hsu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Chang-Chuan Chan","author_inst":"College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Shyr-Chyr Chen","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Jen Chen","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Charles Y.

METHODS We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and\/or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer [&ge;]1:160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2\/FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. RESULTS The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, 30 on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2\/FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days. The upper one-sided 90%CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2\/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95%CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95%CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively. Weaning from CPAP was obtained in 26\/30 patients and 3\/7 were extubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2 likely, 2 possible treatment related). CONCLUSIONS Hyperimmune plasma in Covid-19 shows promising benefits, to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. This proof of concept study could open to future developments including hyperimmune plasma banking, development of standardized pharmaceutical products and monoclonal antibodies.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesare Perotti","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Fausto Baldanti","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Bruno","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Delfante","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Elena Seminari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Casari","author_inst":"Calo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Elena Percivalle","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Glingani","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Valeria Musella","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Mirko Belliato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Martina Garuti","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Marilena Frigato","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Antonio Di Sabatino","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Catherine Klersy","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinco San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Donno","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Massimo Franchini","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113167","rel_title":"A pilot study to investigate the fecal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 virus genome in COVID-19 patients in Odisha, India","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113167","rel_abs":"In infectious diseases, the routes of transmission play major roles in determining the rate and extent of disease spread.

Hence, the major objective of this study was to get the experimental evidence whether in Indian COVID-19 patients fecal dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 genome occurs or not.

The median time for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in the study population was 21 days (IQR 15-27) from symptom onset, with a range of 4 to 45 days. The results of this study suggest that in young and healthy adult patients with COVID-19, the median duration of viral positivity is around three weeks. This duration is higher than previously reported in other populations. Young and healthy adults comprise much of the population workforce, and the results of this study may assist in determining the isolation period for symptomatic adults and confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms.

Objective: To determine the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all HCW. Methods. Cross-sectional study (April 14th- 27th , 2020) of all HCW at Hospital Universitario Fundacion Alcorcon, a second level teaching hospital in Madrid, Spain. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured by ELISA. HCW were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Results: Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (90.5%) were evaluated. Mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1) and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive, with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Among them, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high (33.1%) and medium (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p=0.007), but no difference was found for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p=NS). HCW with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, seropositivity was associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), or nurse- assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27) Conclusions: Seroprevalence uncovered a high rate of infection previously unnoticed among HCW.

Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Denmark is currently opening up after a lockdown in mid-March.Methods We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries.Result Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark and in at least one case find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes is stable after lockdown.Conclusion Our work shows how genetic data can be used to identify routes of introduction of a virus into a region and provide alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission chains suggesting that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted; thus challenging the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality. Our methods can be applied to other countries, regions or even highly localised outbreaks. When used in real-time, we believe they can serve to identify transmission events and supplement traditional methods such as contact tracing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andreas Bluhm","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Matthias Christandl","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Fulvio Gesmundo","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Frederik Ravn Klausen","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Laura Mancinska","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Vincent Steffan","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stilck Franca","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Albert Werner","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"- Working Group Alcorcon COVID-19 investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mirko Belliato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Martina Garuti","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Marilena Frigato","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Antonio Di Sabatino","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Catherine Klersy","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinco San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Donno","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Massimo Franchini","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.122366","rel_title":"Evidence of significant natural selection in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, not humans","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.122366","rel_abs":"RNA viruses are proficient at switching host species, and evolving adaptations to exploit the new hosts cells efficiently.

While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting on the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in ancestral hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor [~]1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species.

Using normal and malignant models and tissues from the aerodigestive and respiratory tracts, we investigated the expression and regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We find that ACE2 expression is restricted to a select population of highly epithelial cells and is repressed by ZEB1, in concert with ZEB1s established role in promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, infection of lung cancer cells with SARS-CoV-2 induces metabolic and transcriptional changes consistent with EMT, including upregulation of ZEB1 and AXL, thereby downregulating ACE2 post-infection. This suggests a novel model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in which infected cells shift toward an increasingly mesenchymal state and lose ACE2 expression, along with its acute respiratory distress syndrome-protective effect, in a ZEB1-dependent manner. AXL-inhibition and ZEB1-reduction, as with bemcentinib, offers a potential strategy to reverse this effect.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"C.

We model isolation by separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group consisting of people that are enforced\/recommended to stay at home. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of R0 and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more lives can be saved. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Soledad Aronna","author_inst":"FGV\/EMAp"},{"author_name":"Roberto Guglielmi","author_inst":"FGV\/EMAp"},{"author_name":"Lucas Machado Moschen","author_inst":"FGV\/EMAp"},{"author_name":"Zhesheng He","author_inst":"Institute of High Energy Physcis"},{"author_name":"Xingfa Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Wenchao Niu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M.

Countries are being gradually exposed to its devastating threat without being properly prepared and with inadequate response. COVID 19 first two cases were reported in Pakistan on February 26, 2020. We present a model depicting progression of epidemiology curve for Pakistan with and without interventions in view of its health system response capacity in near future. Methodology We used a modified compartmental epidemiological SEIR model to describe the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan including the possibility of asymptomatic infection and presymptomatic transmission. The behavior of the dynamic model is determined by a set of clinical parameters and transmission rate. Results We estimated that in the absence of a set of proven interventions, the total susceptible population would be 43.24 million, exposed individuals would be almost 32 million, asymptomatic cases would be 13.13 million, mildly infected 30.64 million, severely infected slightly more than 6 million and critical cases would be around 967,000 in number. By that time, almost 760,000 fatalities of infected critical would have taken place. Comparing with the healthcare capacity of Pakistan, if we could flatten the curve to a level below the dashed grey line, the healthcare system will be capable of managing the cases with ideal healthcare facilities, where the grey line representing the healthcare capacity of Pakistan. With the intervention in place, the number of symptomatic infected individuals is expected to be almost 20 million. Conclusion We consider the impact of intervention and control measures on the spread of COVID-19 with 30% reduction in transmission from mild cases in case a set of interventions are judiciously in place to mitigate its impact.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ejaz Ahmad Khan","author_inst":"Health Services Academy, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maida Umar","author_inst":"United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maryam Khalid","author_inst":"Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zhesheng He","author_inst":"Institute of High Energy Physcis"},{"author_name":"Xingfa Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Wenchao Niu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M.

We are especially interested in how the availability of medication could change the necessary quarantine measures for effective control of the disease. We model the transmission by extending the SEIR model to include asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated and medicated population compartments. We calculate the basic reproduction number R_0 and show that for R_0<1 the disease dies out and for R_0>1 the disease is endemic. Using sensitivity analysis we establish that R_0 is most sensitive to the rates of quarantine and medication. We also study how the effectiveness and the rate of medication along with the quarantine rate affect R_0. We devise optimal quarantine, medication and isolation strategies, noting that availability of medication reduces the duration and severity of the lock-down needed for effective disease control. Our study also reinforces the idea that with the availability of medication, while the severity of the lock downs can be eased over time some social distancing protocols need to be observed, at least till a vaccine is found. We also analyze the COVID-109 outbreak data for four different countries, in two of these, India and Pakistan the curve is still rising, and in he other two, Italy and Spain, the epidemic curve is now falling due to effective quarantine measures. We provide estimates of R_0 and the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population for these countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohsin Ali","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences Lahore"},{"author_name":"Mudassar Imran","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science & Technology, Mishref, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Adnan Khan","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhesheng He","author_inst":"Institute of High Energy Physcis"},{"author_name":"Xingfa Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Wenchao Niu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M.

Methods We evaluated whether some specific post-mortem features are observed in these patients and if these changes are related to the presence of the virus in different organs. Complete macroscopic and microscopic autopsies were performed on different organs in 17 COVID-19 non-survivors. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung samples and with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in lung and other organs. Results Pulmonary findings revealed early-stage diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 15 out of 17 patients and microthrombi in small lung arteries in 11 patients. Late-stage DAD, atypical pneumocytes and\/or acute pneumonia were also observed. Four lung infarcts, two acute myocardial infarctions and one ischemic enteritis were observed. There was no evidence of myocarditis, hepatitis or encephalitis. Kidney evaluation revealed the presence of hemosiderin in tubules or pigmented casts in most patients. Spongiosis and vascular congestion were the most frequently encountered brain lesions. No specific SARS-CoV-2 lesions were observed in any organ. IHC revealed positive cells with a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs of 11 of the 17 (65%) patients; RT-PCR yielded a wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues, with 8 patients showing viral presence in all tested organs (i.e. lung, heart, spleen, liver, colon, kidney and brain).

Methods We undertook a rapid systematic review of automated or partially-automated contact tracing, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020179822). We searched PubMed, EMBASE, OVID Global Health, EBSCO COVID Portal, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv and Google Advanced for articles relevant to COVID-19, SARS, MERS, influenza or Ebola from 1\/1\/2000-14\/4\/2020. Two authors reviewed all full-text manuscripts. One reviewer extracted data using a pre-piloted form; a second independently verified extracted data. Primary outcomes were the number or proportion of contacts (and\/or subsequent cases) identified; secondary outcomes were indicators of outbreak control, app\/tool uptake, resource use, cost-effectiveness and lessons learnt. The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool or CHEERS checklist were used in quality assessment. Findings 4,033 citations were identified and 15 were included. No empirical evidence of automated contact tracing's effectiveness (regarding contacts identified or transmission reduction) was identified. Four of seven included modelling studies suggested that controlling COVID-19 requires high population uptake of automated contact-tracing apps (estimates from 56% to 95%), typically alongside other control measures. Studies of partially-automated contact tracing generally reported more complete contact identification and follow-up, and greater intervention timeliness (0.5-5 hours faster), than previous systems. No meta-analyses were possible. Interpretation Automated contact tracing has potential to reduce transmission with sufficient population uptake and usage. However, there is an urgent need for well-designed prospective evaluations as no studies provided empirical evidence of its effectiveness.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isobel Braithwaite","author_inst":"UCL Public Health Data Science Research Group, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Tom Callender","author_inst":"Department of Applied Health Research, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Miriam Bullock","author_inst":"UCL Collaborative Centre for Inclusion Health, University College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Robert W Aldridge","author_inst":"UCL Public Health Data Science Group, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Camille Verocq","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Lebrun","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Philomene Lavis","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Marie Lucie Racu","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Anne Laure Trepant","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Calliope Maris","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Rorive","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Olivier De Witte","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"John V.

The number of cases and deaths increased dramatically in some countries from March 2020. The objective of our study was to examine potential associated factors with country-variation in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the world. Methods: We performed a retrospective geographic study including all countries with the most recent available data on free access on the web. We analyzed univariate and multivariable correlation between both the number of reported cases and deaths by country and demographic, socioeconomic characteristics, lockdown as major control measure, average annual temperature and relative humidity. We performed simple linear regression, independent t test and ANOVA test for univariate analyses and negative binomial regression model for multivariable analyses. Results: We analyzed data of 186 countries from all world regions. As of 13th April 2020, a total of 1 804 302 COVID-19 cases and 113 444 deaths were reported. The reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by countries was associated with the number of days between the first case and lockdown, the number of cases at lockdown, life expectancy at birth, average annual temperature and the socio-economic level. Countries which never implemented BCG vaccination reported higher mortality than others. Conclusions: The pandemic is still ongoing and poses a global health threat as there is no effective antiviral treatment or vaccines. Thus, timing of control measure implementation is a crucial factor in determining the spread of the epidemic. It should be a lesson for this pandemic and for the future.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hedia Bellali","author_inst":"Tunis El Manar University"},{"author_name":"Neila Chtioui","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Statistics department, A Mami Hospital, Ariana"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Chahed","author_inst":"Medical Faculty of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Robert W Aldridge","author_inst":"UCL Public Health Data Science Group, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Camille Verocq","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Lebrun","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Philomene Lavis","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Marie Lucie Racu","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Anne Laure Trepant","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Calliope Maris","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Rorive","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Olivier De Witte","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"John V.

To determine the presence of and magnitude of associations between baseline associations and anxiety and depression in the US general population, we performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race- stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 45 (16), and 494 (48.8%) were male. Baseline demographic data were similar between those that were (n=663, 66.2%) and were not (n=339, 33.8%) under a shelter in place\/ stay at home order, with the exception of sex and geographic location. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%) meeting clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.49, 0.87]) and living in a larger home (OR 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. Rural location (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03, 1.89]), loneliness (OR 4.92, 95% CI [3.18, 7.62]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.04, 95% CI [1.38, 3.03]), were associated with increased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. 232 subjects (23.6%) met criteria for clinical depression. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.71, 95% CI [0.53, 0.95]), increased time outdoors (OR 0.51, 95% CI [0.29, 0.92]), and living in a larger home (OR 0.35, 95% CI [0.18, 0.69]), were associated with decreased odds of meeting depression criteria. Having lost a job (OR 1.64, 95% CI [1.05, 2.54]), loneliness (OR 10.42, 95% CI [6.26, 17.36]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.42, 95% CI [1.62, 3.62]), were associated with an increased odds of meeting depression criteria. Income, media consumption, and religiosity were not associated with mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression are common in the US general population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are associated with potentially modifiable factors.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bella Nichole Kantor","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kantor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Chahed","author_inst":"Medical Faculty of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Robert W Aldridge","author_inst":"UCL Public Health Data Science Group, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Camille Verocq","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Lebrun","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Philomene Lavis","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Marie Lucie Racu","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Anne Laure Trepant","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Calliope Maris","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Rorive","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Olivier De Witte","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"John V.
