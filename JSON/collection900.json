Implicit solvation methodology may be particularly useful in the early stages of such research, as it can offer valuable insights into the binding process, quickly. Here we evaluate the potential of the related molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGB\/SA) approach to estimate the binding free energy {Delta}Gbind between the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and the human ACE2 receptor. The calculations are based on a recent flavor of the generalized Born model, GBNSR6. Two estimates of {Delta}Gbind are performed: one based on standard bondi radii, and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. We take the average of the resulting two {Delta}Gbind values as the consensus estimate. For the well-studied Ras-Raf protein-protein complex, which has similar binding free energy to that of the SARS-CoV-2\/ACE2 complex, the consensus {Delta}Gbind = -11.8 {+\/-} 1 kcal\/mol, vs. experimental -9.7 {+\/-} 0.2 kcal\/mol.\n\nThe consensus estimates for the SARS-CoV-2\/ACE2 complex is {Delta}Gbind = -9.4 {+\/-} 1.5 kcal\/mol, which is in near quantitative agreement with experiment (-10.6 kcal\/mol). The availability of a conceptually simple MMGB\/SA-based protocol for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 \/ACE2 binding may be beneficial in light of the need to move forward fast.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Negin Forouzesh","author_inst":"California State University, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Alexey V Onufriev","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.256339","rel_title":"Highly potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-DARPin therapeutic candidates","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.256339","rel_abs":"Globally accessible preventive and therapeutic molecules against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. DARPin molecules are an emerging class of novel therapeutics based on naturally occurring repeat proteins ([~]15 kDa in size) and can be rapidly produced in bacteria in large quantities. Here, we report the identification of 380 DARPin molecules specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein selected from a naive library of 1012 DARPin molecules. Using extensive biophysical and biochemical characterization, (pseudo)virus neutralization assays and cryo-EM analysis, 11 mono-DARPin molecules targeting either the receptor binding domain (RBD), the S1 N-terminal-domain (NTD) or the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were chosen. Based on these 11 mono-DARPin molecules, 31 anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-DARPin molecules were constructed which can broadly be grouped into 2 types; multi-paratopic RBD-neutralizing DARPin molecules and multi-mode DARPin molecules targeting simultaneously RBD, NTD and the S2 domain. Each of these multi-DARPin molecules acts by binding with 3 DARPin modules to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, leading to potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection down to 1 ng\/ml (12 pM) and potentially providing protection against viral escape mutations. Additionally, 2 DARPin modules binding serum albumin, conferring an expected half-life of about 3 weeks in humans, were included in the multi-DARPin molecules. The protective efficacy of one multi-DARPin molecule was studied in a Golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model, resulting in a significant reduction in viral load and pathogenesis. In conclusion, the multi-DARPin molecules reported here display very high antiviral potency, high-production yield, and a long systemic half-life, and thereby have the potential for single-dose use for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcel Walser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Rothenberger","author_inst":"Spiez Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Daniel L.

Nearly 0.4 million mutations were identified so far in [~]60,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. In this study, we compared 207 of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported from different parts of Bangladesh and their comparison with 467 globally reported sequences to understand the origin of viruses, possible patterns of mutations, availability of unique mutations, and their apparent impact on pathogenicity of the virus in victims of Bangladeshi population. Phylogenetic analyses indicates that in Bangladesh, SARS-CoV-2 viruses might arrived through infected travelers from European countries, and the GR clade was found as predominant in this region. We found 2602 mutations including 1602 missense mutations, 612 synonymous mutations, 36 insertions and deletions with 352 other mutations types. In line with the global trend, D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein was predominantly high (95.6%) in Bangladeshi isolates. Interestingly, we found the average number of mutations in ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M and N of genomes, having nucleotide shift at G614 (n=459), were significantly higher (p[&le;]0.001) than those having mutation at D614 (n=215). Previously reported frequent mutations such as P4715L, D614G, R203K, G204R and I300F were also prevalent in Bangladeshi isolates. Additionally, 87 unique amino acid changes were revealed and were categorized as originating from different cities of Bangladesh. The analyses would increase our understanding of variations in virus genomes circulating in Bangladesh and elsewhere and help develop novel therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Mahbub Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Rasel Das","author_inst":"Global Innovation Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 816-8580, Japan"},{"author_name":"Md.

We developed the Global COVID Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model with continually improving precision that combines actual mortality counts with Bayesian inference, to predict COVID trends, currently until December 1, 2020. In Colombia, the GCAM analysis found the peak of COVID mortality around August 12 and an expected total of COVID deaths of 24,000-31,000, or 48%-92% over the total through August 21. In Peru, a first mortality peak occurred around May 24, and given the current trajectory, a second peak is predicted around September 6. Peru can expect 29,000-43,000 COVID deaths, representing an increase of 7%-55% over COVID deaths through August 21. GCAM projections are also used to estimate medical surge capacity needs. To gauge the reliability of COVID mortality forecasts, we compared all-cause mortality from January through June 2020 with average all-cause mortality in previous years in Colombia and Peru, and found that the excesses were consistent with GCAM forecast, most notably a doubling of overall mortality from May 25-June 7th of weeks in Peru. The GCAM results predict that as a percentage of all adult deaths in previous years, Colombia can expect about 13% excess from COVID deaths, whereas Peru can expect 34% excess. Comparisons of GCAM analyses of several other countries with Colombia and Peru demonstrate the extreme variability that characterizes COVID mortality around the world, emphasizing the need for country-specific analyses and ongoing monitoring as more mortality data become available.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick E Brown","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto; Department of Statistical Sciences, Unive"},{"author_name":"Zo\u00eb R Greenwald","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Luis Ernesto Salinas","author_inst":"World Bank, Human Development Network and Colombia Country Office"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Aguirre Martens","author_inst":"World Bank, Human Development Network and Colombia Country Office"},{"author_name":"Leslie Newcombe","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Peter S Rodriguez","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Hellen Gelband","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Veillard","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto; World Bank, Human Development Network and"},{"author_name":"Prabhat Jha","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Andreas Cornelius","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Patricia Schildknecht","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Mirela Matzner","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Martin Haenggi","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Marco Franchini","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Kaufmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Iris Schlegel","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Chloe Iss","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Thamar Loser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Susanne Mangold","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christel Herzog","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Dieter Schiegg","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christian Reichen","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Filip Radom","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bosshart","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lehmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Micha A.

Several countries have used large scale SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing as one of the important strategies for combating the pandemic. In order to process the massive needs for coronavirus testing, the usual throughput of routine clinical laboratories has reached and often surpassed its limits and new approaches to cope with this challenge must be developed. This study has aimed to evaluate the use pool of samples as a strategy to optimize the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in a general population. A total of 220 naso\/orofaryngeal swab samples were collected and tested using two different protocols of sample pooling. In the first protocol (Protocol A); 10 clinical samples were pooled before RNA extraction. The second protocol (Protocol B) consisted of pooling the already extracted RNAs from 10 individual samples. Results from Protocol A were identical (100% agreement) with the individual results. However, for results from Protocol B, reduced agreement (91%) was observed in relation to results obtained by individual testing. Inconsistencies observed were related to RT-qPCR results with higher Cycle Thresholds (Ct > 32.73). Furthermore, in pools containing more than one positive individual, the Ct of the pool was equivalent to the lowest Ct among the individual results. These results provide additional evidence in favor of the clinical use of pooled samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR and suggest that pooling of samples before RNA extraction is preferrable in terms of diagnostic yield.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabiana Volpato","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Daiana Lima-Morales","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Priscila Lamb Wink","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Julia Willig","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Fernanda de-Paris","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Patricia Ashton-Prolla","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Afonso Luis Barth","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Veillard","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto; World Bank, Human Development Network and"},{"author_name":"Prabhat Jha","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Andreas Cornelius","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Patricia Schildknecht","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Mirela Matzner","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Martin Haenggi","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Marco Franchini","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Kaufmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Iris Schlegel","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Chloe Iss","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Thamar Loser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Susanne Mangold","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christel Herzog","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Dieter Schiegg","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christian Reichen","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Filip Radom","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bosshart","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lehmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Micha A.

For this reason, efforts to determine changes in laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as biomarkers are urgent. Lipids are essential components of the human body, and their modulation has been observed implicated in some viral infections. Methods: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile changes in Mexican COVID-19 patients, the lipid profile of one hundred two COVID-19 positive patients from three hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa in northwest Mexico, was analyzed. ROC curves and binary logistic regression analysis were used as a predictive model to determine their clinical diagnostic utility. Results: Significant changes in the serum lipid profile of patients with COVID-19, such as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high triglycerides and VLDL were observed. The same abnormalities in the lipid profile among non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients were detected. The predictive model analysis suggests that cholesterol and LDL have AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively, for COVID-19 (p= 0.0002 and p= <0.0001), and LDL low levels might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 (OR= 2.07, 95% IC: 1.18 to 3.63; p= 0.01).

Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological reprogramming of ER stress pathways can be exploited to suppress CoV replication. We found that the ER stress inducer thapsigargin efficiently inhibits coronavirus (HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) replication in different cell types, (partially) restores the virus-induced translational shut-down, and counteracts the CoV-mediated downregulation of IRE1 and the ER chaperone BiP. Proteome-wide data sets revealed specific pathways, protein networks and components that likely mediate the thapsigargin-induced antiviral state, including HERPUD1, an essential factor of ER quality control, and ER-associated protein degradation complexes. The data show that thapsigargin hits a central mechanism required for CoV replication, suggesting that thapsigargin (or derivatives thereof) may be developed into broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs.\n\nOne Sentence Summary \/ Running titleSuppression of coronavirus replication through thapsigargin-regulated ER stress, ERQC \/ ERAD and metabolic pathways","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed Samer Shaban","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Christin Mueller","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Christin Mayr-Buro","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Weiser","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Benadict Vincent Albert","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Axel Weber","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Uwe Linne","author_inst":"Philipps University Marburg"},{"author_name":"Torsten Hain","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Ilya Babayev","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Nadja Karl","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Nina Hofmann","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Stephan Becker","author_inst":"Philipps University Marburg"},{"author_name":"Susanne Herold","author_inst":"Justus Liebig University Giessen"},{"author_name":"M.

Further species were shown to be susceptible under experimental conditions. The extent of natural infections of animals, however, is still largely unknown. Serological methods will be useful tools for tracing SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals once test systems are validated for use in different species. Here, we developed an indirect multi-species ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The newly established ELISA was validated using 59 sera of infected or vaccinated animals including ferrets, raccoon dogs, hamsters, rabbits, chickens, cattle and a cat, and a total of 220 antibody-negative sera of the same animal species. Overall, a diagnostic specificity of 100.0% and sensitivity of 98.31% was achieved, and the functionality with every species included in this study could be demonstrated. Hence, a versatile and reliable ELISA protocol was established that enables high-throughput antibody detection in a broad range of animal species, which may be used for outbreak investigations, to assess the seroprevalence in susceptible species or to screen for reservoir or intermediate hosts.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kerstin Wernike","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Andrea Aebischer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anna Michelitsch","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Donata Hoffmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Conrad Freuling","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anne Balkema-Buschmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Annika Graaf","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas Mueller","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Melanie Rissmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Dennis Rubbenstroth","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Jacob Schoen","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Claudia Schulz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover"},{"author_name":"Jakob Trimpert","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lorenz Ulrich","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Asisa Volz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover"},{"author_name":"Thomas Mettenleiter","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Beer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thamar Loser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Susanne Mangold","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christel Herzog","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Dieter Schiegg","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christian Reichen","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Filip Radom","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bosshart","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lehmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Micha A.

This protein is involved in modulating the host adaptive immunity through downregulating MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules and innate immune responses by surpassing the interferon mediated antiviral response of the host. To understand the immune perspective of the host with respect to the ORF8 protein, a comprehensive study of the ORF8 protein as well as mutations possessed by it, is performed. Chemical and structural properties of ORF8 proteins from different hosts, that is human, bat and pangolin, suggests that the ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat RaTG13-CoV are very much closer related than that of Pangolin-CoV. Eighty-seven mutations across unique variants of ORF8 (SARS-CoV-2) are grouped into four classes based on their predicted effects. Based on geolocations and timescale of collection, a possible flow of mutations was built. Furthermore, conclusive flows of amalgamation of mutations were endorsed upon sequence similarity and amino acid conservation phylogenies. Therefore, this study seeks to highlight the uniqueness of rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 through the ORF8.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sk.

Among these, antibodies and vaccines are particularly attractive because of their high specificity, low probability of drug-drug interaction, and potentially long-standing protective effects. While the threat at hand justifies the pace of research, the implementation of therapeutic strategies cannot be exempted from safety considerations. There are several potential adverse events reported after the vaccination or antibody therapy, but two are of utmost importance: antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, the depletion or exhaustion of T-cells has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This observation suggests a potential role of vaccines eliciting cellular immunity, which might simultaneously limit the risk of ADE and CSS. Such risk was proposed to be associated with FcR-induced activation of proinflammatory macrophages (M1) by Fu et al. 2020 and Iwasaki et al. 2020. All aspects of the newly developed vaccine (including the route of administration, delivery system, and adjuvant selection) may affect its effectiveness and safety. In this work we use a novel in silico approach (based on AI and bioinformatics methods) developed to support the design of epitope-based vaccines. We evaluated the capabilities of our method for predicting the immunogenicity of epitopes. Next, the results of our approach were compared with other vaccine-design strategies reported in the literature. The risk of immuno-toxicity was also assessed. The analysis of epitope conservation among other Coronaviridae was carried out in order to facilitate the selection of peptides shared across different SARS-CoV-2 strains and which might be conserved in emerging zootic coronavirus strains. Finally, the potential applicability of the selected epitopes for the development of a vaccine eliciting cellular immunity for COVID-19 was discussed, highlighting the benefits and challenges of such an approach.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni Mazzocco","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Iga Niemiec","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Alexander Myronov","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland; Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Piotr Skoczylas","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Jan Kaczmarczyk","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Anna Sanecka-Duin","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Gruba","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland; Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Paulina Kr\u00f3l","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Micha\u0142 Drwal","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marian Szczepanik","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Pyr\u0107","author_inst":"Virogenetics Laboratory of Virology, Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Piotr St\u0119pniak","author_inst":"Ardigen"},{"author_name":"Alex Espinosa","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Wesley Wu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"- CLIAHUB Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Debra A Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andreas Puschnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Norma Neff","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Vida Ahyong","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Steve Miller","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ayscue","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Tato","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Simon Paul","author_inst":"Madera County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Emily Dawn Crawford","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Toni Vagt","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Sigrist","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Marcel Straumann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Karl Proba","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Niina Veitonmaki","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Keith M.

We developed a cell line with inducible ACE2 expression to confirm that D614G more efficiently enters cells with ACE2 levels spanning the different primary cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Using a new assay for crosslinking and directly extracting Spike trimers from the pseudovirus surface, we found an increase in trimerization efficiency and viral incorporation of D614G protomers.

Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site ({Delta}PRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the {Delta}PRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the {Delta}PRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT50 titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2 assays.\n\nImportanceAs COVID-19 has impacted the world, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and causes virulence offers potential pathways to disrupt its disease. By removing the furin cleavage site, we demonstrate the importance of this insertion to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the findings with Vero cells indicate the likelihood of cell culture adaptations in virus stocks that can influence reagent generation and interpretation of a wide range of data including neutralization and drug efficacy. Overall, our work highlights the importance of this key motif in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.\n\nArticle SummaryA deletion of the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 amplifies replication in Vero cells, but attenuates replication in respiratory cells and pathogenesis in vivo. Loss of the furin site also reduces susceptibility to neutralization in vitro.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryan A Johnson","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Birte Kalveram","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kumari G Lokugamage","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Antonio Muruato","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jing Zou","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xianwen Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Terry Juelich","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Smith","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Lihong Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Craig Schindewolf","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Michelle N Vu","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Abigail Vanderheiden","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Scott Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Mehul Suthar","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Laurence Routh","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

To gain entry, the virus uses its spike protein to bind to host hACE-2 receptors on the host cell surface and mediate fusion between viral and cell membranes. As initial steps leading to virus entry involves significant changes in protein conformation as well as in the electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the spike-hACE-2 complex, we explored the sensitivity of the interaction to changes in ionic strength through computational simulations and surface plasmon resonance. We identified two regions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), E1 and E2, which interact differently with hACE-2. At high salt concentration, E2-mediated interactions are weakened but are compensated by strengthening E1-mediated hydrophobic interactions.

This population experiences a higher proportion of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses than the general population and has been shown to have a high morbidity and mortality in relation to COVID-19. Methods We examined the number of hospital discharges to all Welsh adult care homes and the subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring over an 18 week period 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on the incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics (including size, type of provision and health board). Results A total of 1068 care homes were monitored; 330 homes experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, and 511 homes received a discharge from hospital over the study period. The exposure to discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.49, p = 0.28), after adjusting for care home size, which was by far the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison to homes of <10 residents were: 3.4 (2.0, 5.8) for 10-24 residents; 8.3 (5.0, 13.8) for 25-49 residents; and 17.3 (9.6, 31.1) for homes of 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were very similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison to periods when homes were unexposed. Conclusion Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.

Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April-May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer\/COVID-19 patients experience.\n\nAuthor SummaryCancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and non-cancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients. The high number of minor variations can result in the selection of immune escape variants, resistance to potential drugs, and\/or increased pathogenicity. The impact of this higher intrahost variability over time warrants further investigation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliana Siqueira","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Cancer"},{"author_name":"Livia  R.

Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of COVID-19. We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex RT-PCR on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S-amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swab) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (3 hospitals and 3 public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID-hospital, but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplets traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions and faecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by RT-PCR. Monitoring fomites can support evaluation of indirect transmission risks for Coronavirus or other flu-like viruses in the environment.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Piana","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Maria Eugenia Colucci","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Federica Valeriani","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Unit of Public Health-Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biotechnologies, University of Rome Foro Italico"},{"author_name":"Adriano Marcolongo","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Sotgiu","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Cesira Pasquarella","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Lory Marika Margarucci","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Unit of Public Health-Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biotechnologies, University of Rome Foro Italico"},{"author_name":"Andrea Petrucca","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Gianfranceschi","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Unit of Public Health-Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biotechnologies, University of Rome Foro Italico"},{"author_name":"Sergio Babudieri","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Pietro Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

To determine the impact of school reopening with varying levels of operating capacity and face-mask adherence, we used an agent-based model calibrated to and validated against multiple data types from the state of Indiana, USA. In our model, transmission can occur in schools, workplaces, community settings, and households, all of which are structured in a realistic way according to state geography and demography. Using this model, we quantified the burden of COVID-19 on K-12 students, teachers, their families, and the general population under alternative scenarios about school reopening. In our primary analysis, we considered three levels of school operating capacity (50%, 75%, and 100%) and three assumptions about face-mask adherence in schools (50%, 75%, and 100%). Under a scenario in which schools operate remotely, we projected 45,579 (95% CrI: 14,109-132,546) infections and 790 (95% CrI: 176-1680) deaths between August 24 and December 31. Reopening at 100% capacity with 50% face-mask adherence in schools resulted in a proportional increase of 42.9 (95% CrI: 41.3-44.3) times that number of infections and 9.2 (95% CrI: 8.9-9.5) times that number of deaths. In contrast, operating at 50% capacity with 100% face-mask adherence resulted in only an 11% (95% CrI: 5%-18%) increase in the number of infections compared to the scenario in which schools operate remotely. We conclude that reduced capacity and high face-mask adherence in schools substantially reduce the burden of COVID-19, both among those with direct ties to schools and across the state. As Indiana and other states proceed with school reopening, our results illustrate quantitatively the benefits of safety measures that schools are undertaking, underscoring their value for both schools and their communities.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guido Espana","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Rachel J Oidtman","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Carly Barbera","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alan Costello","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Anita Lerch","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Marya Poterek","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

Machine learning (ML) based technologies have played a substantial role in solving complex problems, and several organizations have been swift to adopt and customize them in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review on the role of ML as a comprehensive and decisive technology to fight the COVID-19 crisis in the arena of epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease progression. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify all potentially relevant studies published and made available between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020. The search syntax was built using keywords specific to COVID-19 and ML. A total of 128 qualified articles were reviewed and analyzed based on the study objectives. Results: The 128 publications selected were classified into three themes based on ML applications employed to combat the COVID-19 crisis: Computational Epidemiology (CE), Early Detection and Diagnosis (EDD), and Disease Progression (DP). Of the 128 studies, 70 focused on predicting the outbreak, the impact of containment policies, and potential drug discoveries, which were grouped into the CE theme. For the EDD, we grouped forty studies that applied ML techniques to detect the presence of COVID-19 using the patient's radiological images or lab results. Eighteen publications that focused on predicting the disease progression, outcomes (recovery and mortality), Length of Stay (LOS), and number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days for COVID-19 positive patients were classified under the DP theme. Conclusions: In this systematic review, we assembled the current COVID-19 literature that utilized ML methods to provide insights into the COVID-19 themes, highlighting the important variables, data types, and available COVID-19 resources that can assist in facilitating clinical and translational research.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hafsa Bareen Syeda","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahanazuddin Syed","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wayne Sexton","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shorabuddin Syed","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Salma Begum","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farhan Syed","author_inst":"Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feliciano Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Arkansas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

Yet, current methods for screening mental health issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, blocked by social stigmas and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in mental health profiles of users through a non-invasive manner. Objective: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. Methods: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental health profiles in terms of these features. Results: Of the 49 participants, 41% (n=20) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the PHQ-9 score > 5) in depression, denoted as DEP; 45% (n=22) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the GAD-7 score > 5) in anxiety, denoted as ANX. Of the 5 features proposed to quantify online behavior changes, statistical significances were found between the DEP and non-DEP groups for all of them (P<.01, effect sizes \\eta_{partial}^2 ranging between 0.130 to 0.320); statistical significances were found between the ANX and non-ANX groups for 4 of them (P<.02, effect sizes \\eta_{partial}^2 ranging between 0.115 to 0.231). Significant features included late-night online activities, continuous usages and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs. Conclusions: The results suggested strong discrepancies between college student groups with and without deteriorating mental health conditions in terms of behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube usages during the COVID-19. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anis Zaman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Boyu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Hoque","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Vincent Silenzio","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Henry Kautz","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Farhan Syed","author_inst":"Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feliciano Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Arkansas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

Numerous clinical variables have been retrospectively associated with disease severity, but the predictive value of these variables, and how multiple variables interact to increase risk, remains unclear. Methods: We used machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 severity in 354 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Using clinical variables only collected on or before a patient's COVID-19 positive date (time zero), we sought to classify patients into one of three possible future outcomes: Severe-early (the patient required high levels of oxygen support within 3 days of being tested positive for COVID-19), Severe-late (the patient required high levels of oxygen after 3 days), and Non-severe (the patient never required oxygen support). Results: Our algorithm classified patients into these classes with an AUROC ranging from 70-85%, significantly outperforming prior methods and univariate analyses. Critically, classification accuracy is highest when using a potpourri of clinical variables -- including patient demographics, pre-existing diagnoses, laboratory and radiological work, and underlying cancer type -- suggesting that COVID-19 in cancer patients comes with numerous, combinatorial risk factors. Conclusions: Overall, we provide a computational tool that can identify high-risk patients early in their disease progression, which could aid in clinical decision-making and selecting treatment options.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saket Navlakha","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sejal Morjaria","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Rocio Perez-Johnston","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Allen Zhang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Farhan Syed","author_inst":"Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feliciano Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Arkansas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

The disease dynamics is specified by an age-structured SAPHIRE model whose parameters are estimated by the standard least square method using the epidemic data from New York City. We derive optimal static allocation policies with different objectives under different amounts of daily available vaccines, and examine several dynamic allocation heuristics including old-first policy, infection-first policy, myopic policy, death-weighted myopic policy, and two-day myopic policy. For static policies, our numerical study shows that to minimize the total deaths, it is optimal to allocate limited vaccines to the oldest group first and then the younger group if there are capacities remaining. In contrast, to minimize the total confirmed cases, the optimal static policy allocates a considerable portion of vaccines to younger groups even if the daily available vaccines are very limited. The optimal static policies achieve a much smaller number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to two benchmark policies: a uniform allocation policy that allocates available vaccines equally to each age group, and a proportional allocation policy that allocates available vaccines proportionally to the population of each age group. For dynamic allocation policies, the myopic policy and the two-day myopic policy have similar performance and significantly outperforms the other dynamic heuristics and the static policies in terms of the confirmed cases and deaths.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Chen","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Menglong Li","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"David Simchi-Levi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tiancheng Zhao","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Farhan Syed","author_inst":"Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feliciano Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Arkansas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 578 randomly selected health care workers (HCW) from Hospital Clinic de Barcelona was 11.2%. Methods. A follow-up survey one month after the baseline (April-May 2020) measured SARS-CoV-2 infection by real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and IgM, IgA, IgG and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by Luminex. Prevalence of infection was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and\/or antibody seropositivity. Results. The cumulative prevalence of infection at month 1 was 14.9% (84\/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82\/565) for IgM and\/or IgG and\/or IgA. We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection at baseline (501) and two participants seroreverted for IgM and\/or IgG and\/or IgA. Among seropositive participants at baseline, IgM and IgA levels generally declined at month 1 (antibody decay rates of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.40-0.60) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.26-0.44)), respectively. Eight percent of the participants seroreverted for IgM and 11% for IgA. Subjects reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and laboratory and other technicians had higher risk of infection. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG2, followed by IgG3, with higher levels of IgG1, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the importance of a continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW, particularly in high risk groups. The decay of IgA and IgM levels have implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gemma Moncunill","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Santano","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alfons Jimenez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Marta Vidal","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Marta Tortajada","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sergi Sanz","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Susana Mendez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Ruth Aguilar","author_inst":"ISglobal"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Mikel Martinez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Javier Moreno","author_inst":"ISglobal"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"ISglobal"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alberto L Garcia-Basteiro","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)"},{"author_name":"Heyrhyoung Lyoo","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Wang","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Wentao Li","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Ieva Drulyte","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"H.

The sensitivity of RT-PCR ranged between 79-95%; while increasing with disease severity, it decreased rapidly over time in mild COVID-19 cases.

Recent studies have provided valuable insights regarding the dynamics of the antibody response in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. However, the information regarding the dynamics of the serological and cellular memory in COVID-19 recovered patients in scarce. It is imperative to determine the persistence of humoral memory in COVID-19 recovered patients as it will help to evaluate the susceptibility of recovered patients to re-infection. Here, we describe the dynamics of both the SARS-CoV-2 specific serological and B cell response in COVID-19 recovered patients. We found that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients mount a robust antibody response following infection however, the serological memory decays in recovered patients over the period of 6 months. On the other hand, the B cell response as observed in the SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cell compartment, was found to be stable over time. Moreover, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific B cell plasmablasts was found to be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels. These data, suggests that the differentiation of short-lived plasmablasts to become long-lived plasma cells is impaired and the main contributor of antibody production are the short-lived plasmablasts. Overall, our data provides insights regarding the humoral memory persistence in recovered COVID-19 patients. Notwithstanding the insights from this study, it is still to be determined if the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells can be considered as a correlate of protection in the absence of serological memory.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Vaisman-Mentesh","author_inst":"1The Shmunis School of Biomedicine and Cancer Research, George S.

In the Philippines, with a large population of overseas Filipino contract workers (OFWs), as well as foreign workers in the local online gaming industry and visitors from nearby countries, the first reported cases were from a Chinese couple visiting the country in mid-January 2020. Three months on, by mid-March, the COVID-19 cases in the Philippines had reached its first 100, before it exploded to the present 178,022 cases (as of August 20, 2020). Here, we report a genomic survey of six (6) whole genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus collected from COVID-19 patients seen at the Philippine General Hospital, the major referral hospital for COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila at about the time the Philippines had over a hundred cases. Analysis of commonly observed variants did not reveal a clear pattern of the virus evolving towards a more infectious and severe strain. When combined with other available viral sequences from the Philippines and from GISAID, phylogenomic analysis reveal that the sequenced Philippine isolates can be classified into three primary groups based on collection dates and possible infection sources: (1) January samples collected in the early phases of the pandemic that are closely associated with isolates from Wuhan, China; (2) March samples that are mainly linked to the M\/V Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak; and (3) June samples that clustered with European isolates, one of which already harbor the globally prevalent D614G mutation which initially circulated in Europe. The presence of community-acquired viral transmission amidst compulsory and strict quarantine protocols, particularly for repatriated Filipino workers, highlights the need for a refinement of the quarantine, testing, and tracing strategies currently being implemented to adapt to the current pandemic situation.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francis A.

However, seroprevalence studies have been scarce in South East Asia including India, which, as of now, carries the third largest burden of confirmed cases in the world. The present study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody among hospitalized patients at one of the largest government hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India, recruited consecutive patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or CB-NAAT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels targeting recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS CoV-2 were estimated in serum samples by the ELISA method. Results: A total of 212 hospitalized patients were recruited in the study with mean age (+\/-SD) of 41.2 (+\/-15.4) years and 55% male population. Positive serology against SARS CoV-2 was detected in 19.8% patients(95% CI 14.7-25.8). Residency in Delhi conferred a higher frequency of seropositivity 26.5% (95% CI 19.3-34.7) as compared to that of other states 8% (95% CI 3.0-16.4) with p-value 0.001. No particular age groups or socio-economic strata showed a higher proportion of seropositivity. Conclusion: Around, one-fifth of hospitalized patients, who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 before, demonstrated seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2. While there was no significant difference in the different age groups and socio-economic classes; residence in Delhi was associated with increased risk (relative risk of 3.62, 95% CI 1.59-8.21) Key Words: SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody, Seroprevalence, Hospitalized patient, COVID-19","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Animesh Ray","author_inst":"All India Institute Of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute Of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Souvick Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana"},{"author_name":"Farha Mehdi","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Batra","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana"},{"author_name":"Aakansha Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ayush Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bhavesh M","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Sahni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chaithra R","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chitrakshi Nagpal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gagantej B H","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Umang Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kartikeya Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ranveer Singh Jadon","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashish Datt Upadhyay","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Nischal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naval K Vikram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"R M Pandey","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Alessandra C.

We sought to assess strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital setting via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation, tracing and quarantine, wearing facial masks\/ personal protective equipment. Methods: We developed an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission among healthcare workers in a hospital setting. We calibrated the model using data of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital unit in Wuhan in a Bayesian framework. The calibrated model was used to simulate different intervention scenarios and estimate the impact of different interventions on outbreak size and workday loss. Results: We estimated that work-related stress increases susceptibility to COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers by 52% (90% Credible Interval (CrI): 16.4% - 93.0%). The use of high efficacy facial masks was shown to be able to reduce infection cases and workday loss by 80% (90% CrI: 73.1% - 85.7%) and 87% (CrI: 80.0% - 92.5%), respectively. The use of social distancing alone, through reduced contacts between healthcare workers, had a marginal impact on the outbreak. A strict quarantine policy with the isolation of symptomatic cases and a high fraction of pre-symptomatic\/ asymptomatic cases (via contact tracing or high test rate), could only prolong outbreak duration with minimal impact on the outbreak size. Our results indicated that a quarantine policy should be coupled with other interventions to achieve its effect. The effectiveness of all these interventions was shown to increase with their early implementation. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital's non-COVID-19 unit can be controlled or mitigated by the use of existing non-pharmaceutical measures.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qimin Huang","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Anirban Mondal","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary Ann Horn","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Fei Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"David Gurarie","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Shubham Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chitrakshi Nagpal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gagantej B H","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Umang Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kartikeya Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ranveer Singh Jadon","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashish Datt Upadhyay","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Nischal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naval K Vikram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"R M Pandey","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Alessandra C.

While acute and intermediate interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively, long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remained to be analyzed. Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully capable to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon TCR stimulation. Collectively, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of immune signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"jia liu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuecheng Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua Wang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Ziwei Li","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Deng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Liu jing","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shue Xiong","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Junyi He","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Guo","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Gennadiy Zelinskyy","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Sutter","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Menne","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Feng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Shaira A.
