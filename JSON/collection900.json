The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2s higher infectivity may lie in its host receptor recognition mechanism. This is because experiments show that the human ACE2 protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to CoV-2s spike protein 5-20 fold stronger than SARS-CoVs spike protein. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained and, in fact, a comparison of X-ray structures leads to an opposite proposition. To gain insight, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations indicate that CoV-2s higher affinity is due primarily to differences in specific spike residues that are local to the spike-ACE2 interface, although there are allosteric effects in binding. Comparative analysis of equilibrium simulations reveals that while both CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complexes have similar interfacial topologies, CoV-2s spike protein engages in greater numbers, combinatorics and probabilities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ACE2. We attribute CoV-2s higher affinity to these differences in polar contacts, and these findings also highlight the importance of thermal structural fluctuations in spike-ACE2 complexation. We anticipate that these findings will also inform the design of spike-ACE2 peptide blockers that, like in the cases of HIV and Influenza, can serve as antivirals.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian M.

The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis\/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric R.

Here we apply single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to hACE2, S opens sequentially into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate. Conformational preferences of convalescent plasma and antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either competition with hACE2 for binding to RBD or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry.

Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications. Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265 biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession, PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA,TNF-{propto}, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2). These trends align with proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology. We explore these trends as we put forth a COVID-19 biomarker resource that will help researchers and diagnosticians alike.

Understanding anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in population with different genetic backgrounds and tracking the viral evolution are crucial for successful vaccine design. In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0 algorithm for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a key antigen that is targeted by both B cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601. Our analysis of 1000 S protein sequences from field isolates collected globally over the past few months identified three recurrent point mutations including L5F, D614G and G1124V. Differential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by corresponding HLA alleles were observed. Finally, our multiple alignment analysis indicated the absence of seasonal CoV induced cross-reactive CD8 T cells to drive these mutations. Our findings provided molecular explanations for the observation that individuals with certain HLA alleles such as B*44 are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studying anti-S protein specific CD8 T cell immunity in diverse genetic background is critical for better control and prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hailong Guo","author_inst":"none"},{"author_name":"Elisa Guo","author_inst":"none"},{"author_name":"Keith A Crandall","author_inst":"George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Robel Kahsay","author_inst":"George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Darren A.

At the start of term, students arrive from geographically diverse locations and potentially have higher numbers of social contacts than the general population, particularly if living in university halls of residence accommodation. Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding the potential spread of infection and are being actively used to inform policy about the management of COVID-19. Our aim was to provide a rapid review and appraisal of the literature on mathematical models investigating COVID-19 infection in a university setting. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, bioRxiv\/ medRxiv and sought expert input via social media to identify relevant papers. BioRxiv\/ medRxiv and PubMed\/Web of Science searches took place on 3 and 6 July 2020, respectively. Papers were restricted to English language. Screening of peer-reviewed and pre-print papers and contact with experts yielded five relevant papers - all of which were pre-prints. All models suggest a significant potential for transmission of COVID-19 in universities. Testing of symptomatic persons and screening of the university community regardless of symptoms, combined with isolation of infected individuals and effective contact tracing were critical for infection control in the absence of other mitigation interventions. When other mitigation interventions were considered (such as moving teaching online, social\/physical distancing, and the use of face coverings) the additional value of screening for infection control was limited. Multiple interventions will be needed to control infection spread within the university setting and the interaction with the wider community is an important consideration. Isolation of identified cases and quarantine of contacts is likely to lead to large numbers of students requiring educational, psychological and behavioural support and will likely have a large impact on the attendance of students (and staff), necessitating online options for teaching, even where in-person classes are taking place. Models were highly sensitive to assumptions in the parameters, including the number and type of individuals contacts, number of contacts traced, frequency of screening and delays in testing. Future models could aid policy decisions by considering the incremental benefit of multiple interventions and using empirical data on mixing within the university community and with the wider community where available. Universities will need to be able to adapt quickly to the evolving situation locally to support the health and wellbeing of the university and wider communities.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hannah Christensen","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Katy Turner","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Adam Trickey","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ross D Booton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Gibran Hemani","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Emily Nixon","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks Pollock","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jan Lukas Robertus","author_inst":"National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Gabrani","author_inst":"IBM Research Europe"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosen-Zvi","author_inst":"IBM Research Haifa"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Methods: We performed a survey addressed to patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives for the control of their autoimmune diseases. The survey was distributed with special attention to Spanish patient associations centred on autoimmune diseases and rheumatology and to the general population. A sample of untreated subjects was matched to the treated group according to sex, age range and incidence region. COVID-19 disease prevalence was compared between treated and untreated-matched control sample. Results: A total of 319 surveys of patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives were recovered for further analysis. The prevalence of declared COVID-19 status in the treated group was 5.3% and the mean prevalence among the untreated-matched groups was 3.4%. A community exposition to COVID-19 was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 in both, treated (17.0% vs. 3.2%; p-value<0.001) and untreated groups (13.4% vs. 1.1%; p-value=0.027). Conclusion: We did not find differences of reported COVID-19 cases between treated and untreated groups, indicating a lack of protection by regular administration of chloroquine and its derivative drugs on COVID-19 infection.

Objective: To gain insight into the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs working in elderly care settings. Design: Cross-sectional study among HCWs working in elderly care in the South-East of the Netherlands, testing for SARS-CoV-2, between March 31 and April 17, 2020. Setting: HCWs working in geriatric rehabilitation, somatic and psychogeriatric wards or small-scale living groups and district nursing, with a total of 5245 HCWs within 4 organisations. Participants: 621 HCWs with mild respiratory symptoms. Main Outcomes: Number of HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs, using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, N-gene, and RdRP. HCWs filled out a survey to collect information on symptoms and possible sources of infection. Results: 133\/615 (21.6%) HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 15.6 to 44.4% per elderly care organisation, and from 0 to 64.3% per separate location of the organizations, respectively. 74.6% of tested HCWs were nursing staff, 1.7% elderly care physicians, 20.3% other HCWs with patient contact and 3.4% HCWs without patient contact. In the univariate analysis, fever, runny or stuffy nose, anosmia, general malaise, myalgia, headache and ocular pain were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while gastro-intestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms, other than runny or stuffy nose were not. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity were contact with patients or colleagues with suspected or proven COVID-19. Whole genome sequencing of 22 samples in 2 facilities strongly suggests spread within facilities. Conclusions and Relevance: We found a high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs in nursing homes and district nursing, supporting the hypothesis of undetected spread within elderly care facilities.

Objectives: To evaluate the degree of correlation between neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) binding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG levels measured by four commercial immunoassays in sera drawn from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients and Methods: Ninety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were assayed by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays. Results: Overall, the results obtained with the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test showed the highest agreement with the NtAb assay ({kappa}, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1). The most sensitive tests were the pseudotyped virus NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay (92.2% for both). Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Rho=0.73) and moderate for the remaining assays (Rho=0.48 to 0.59). The kinetic profile of serum NtAb50 titers could not be reliably predicted by any of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays. Conclusions: the suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arantxa Valdivia","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Torres","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Victor Latorre","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carla Frances-Gomez","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Eliseo Albert","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Roberto Gozalbo","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Alcaraz","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Javier Buesa","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jesus Rodriguez-Diaz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ron Geller","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Gabrani","author_inst":"IBM Research Europe"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosen-Zvi","author_inst":"IBM Research Haifa"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective, secondary database review study was conducted. The information was collected from an epidemiological surveillance activity in close contacts (co-inhabitants) in 52 households in Metropolitan Lima with only one member with COVID-19. A reevaluation was carried out in 10 households. Epidemiological and clinical variables were evaluated and its association with the result of the rapid serological test (presence of IgG, IgM or both). Results: Secondary cases were found in 40 households, which represents an average of 49.9% identification per household. A secondary attack rate of 53.0% (125 cases) was found among cohabitants, with 77.6% of cases being symptomatic (symptomatic \/ asymptomatic ratio: 3.5). The presence of fever and \/ or chills was found in 40.0% of people with a positive result, followed by a sore throat, in 39.2%. Ageusia and anosmia were present in 22.4% and 20.8% of cases, respectively. A reevaluation in 40 family members 33.6 +\/- 2.7 days after the first evaluation, show the persistence of positive IgM and IgG in the 20 positive cases in the first evaluation. Conclusion: Having a primary case of COVID-19 in home, the secondary attack rate of this infection is 53%; however, in a significant proportion of households evaluated there was no positive case, beyond the primary case. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics found in this case were in accordance with what has already been reported in other international series.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yolanda Angulo-Baz\u00e1n","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Gilmer Solis","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Joshi Acosta","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Fany Cardenas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Ana Jorge","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9sar Cabezas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Alcaraz","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Javier Buesa","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jesus Rodriguez-Diaz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ron Geller","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Gabrani","author_inst":"IBM Research Europe"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosen-Zvi","author_inst":"IBM Research Haifa"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Given the rapid and intense spread of SARS-CoV-2, digital contact tracing has emerged as a potential complementary tool to support containment and mitigation efforts. Early modelling studies highlighted the potential of digital contact tracing to break transmission chains, and Google and Apple subsequently developed the Exposure Notification (EN) framework, making it available to the vast majority of smartphones. A growing number of governments have launched or announced EN-based contact tracing apps, but their effectiveness remains unknown. Here, we report early findings of the digital contact tracing app deployment in Switzerland. We demonstrate proof-of-principle that digital contact tracing reaches exposed contacts, who then test positive for SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that digital contact tracing is an effective complementary tool for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Continued technical improvement and international compatibility can further increase the efficacy, particularly also across country borders.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcel Salath\u00e9","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Interfaculty Platform for Data and Computational Science (INPUT), University"},{"author_name":"Nanina Anderegg","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Daniele Antonioli","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Tala Ballouz","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Edouard Bugnion","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Srjan Capkun","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dennis Jackson","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sang-Il Kim","author_inst":"Federal Office of Public Health, Liebefeld, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"James Larus","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wouter Lueks","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Cedric Moullet","author_inst":"Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mathias Payer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20188003","rel_title":"The Geography of Excess Deaths in England during the Covid-19 pandemic: Longer term impacts and monthly dynamics","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20188003","rel_abs":"Physical social interaction relevant to the spread of infectious diseases occurs, by its nature, at a local level.

The second part examines monthly mortality dynamics in relation to predictions from a spatial SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model of infection introduced by Bisin and Moro (2020). The analysis indicates that during the peak months of the Covid-19 pandemic, a larger non-white population and higher social deprivation in an area were associated with higher excess mortality, particularly among men. Regarding dynamics, higher population density accelerated the growth in mortality during the upsurge in infection and increased its rate of decline after the peak of the epidemic, thereby producing a more peaked mortality profile. There is also evidence of a slower post-peak decline in mortality in more socially deprived areas but a more rapid decline in areas with a larger non-white population.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Breen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nanina Anderegg","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Daniele Antonioli","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Tala Ballouz","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Edouard Bugnion","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Srjan Capkun","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dennis Jackson","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sang-Il Kim","author_inst":"Federal Office of Public Health, Liebefeld, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"James Larus","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wouter Lueks","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Cedric Moullet","author_inst":"Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mathias Payer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.04.20188235","rel_title":"Trend prediction of COVID-19 based on ARIMA model in mainland of China","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188235","rel_abs":"Abstract: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has aroused widespread concern around the world and poses a severe threat to public health worldwide.

To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Design: Baseline data from a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Australia, 27th March to 12th June 2020. Participants: Australians aged 18+ years, employed in a paid job prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey. Main Outcome Measures: Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress. Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score <= 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results: 2,603 respondents including groups who had lost their job (N=541), were not working but remained employed (N=613), were working less (N=789) and whose work was unaffected (N=789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR=2.22-3.66), poor mental (AOR=1.78-2.27) and physical health (AOR=2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR=5.43-8.36), poor mental (AOR=1.92-4.53) and physical health (AOR=1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion: Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources. Responses that increase financial security and enhance social connections may partially alleviate the health impacts of work loss.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Griffiths","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Luke Sheehan","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Caryn Van Vreden","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Dennis Petrie","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Grant","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Peter Whiteford","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Sim","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Alex Collie","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Sang-Il Kim","author_inst":"Federal Office of Public Health, Liebefeld, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"James Larus","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wouter Lueks","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Cedric Moullet","author_inst":"Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mathias Payer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20164947","rel_title":"Effectiveness of digital interventions to improve household and community infection prevention and control behaviours and to reduce incidence of respiratory and\/or gastro-intestinal infections: A rapid systematic review","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20164947","rel_abs":"Background Digital interventions have potential to efficiently support improved hygiene practices to reduce transmission of COVID-19. Objective To evaluate the evidence for digital interventions to improve hygiene practices within the community. Methods We reviewed articles published between 01 January 2000 and 26 May 2019 that presented a controlled trial of a digital intervention to improve hygiene behaviours in the community. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure and grey literature. Trials in hospitals were excluded, as were trials aiming at prevention of sexually transmitted infections; only target diseases with transmission mechanisms similar to COVID-19 (e.g. respiratory and gastrointestinal infections) were included. Trials had to evaluate a uniquely digital component of an intervention. Study designs were limited to randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time series analyses. Outcomes could be either incidence of infections or change in hygiene behaviours. The Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess study quality. Results We found seven studies that met the inclusion criteria. Six studies reported successfully improving self-reported hygiene behaviour or health outcomes, but only one of these six trials confirmed improvements using objective measures (reduced consultations and antibiotic prescriptions), Germ Defence. Settings included kindergartens, workplaces, and service station restrooms. Modes of delivery were diverse: WeChat, website, text messages, audio messages to mobiles, electronic billboards, and electronic personal care records. Four interventions targeted parents of young children with educational materials. Two targeted the general population; these also used behaviour change techniques or theory to inform the intervention. Only one trial had low risk of bias, Germ Defence; the most common concerns were lack of information about the randomisation, possible bias in reporting of behavioural outcomes, and lack of an analysis plan and possible selective reporting of results. Conclusion There was only one intervention that was judged to be at low risk of bias, Germ Defence, which reduced incidence and severity of illness, as confirmed by objective measures. Further evaluation is required to determine the effectiveness of the other interventions reviewed.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalie Gold","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK; Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yang Hu","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Denford","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School (PHS), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bristol; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ru-Yu Xia","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China"},{"author_name":"Lauren Towler","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Julia Groot","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Rachel Gledhill","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Merlin Willcox","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Ben Ainsworth","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Sascha Miller","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Moore","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Little","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Aml\u00f4t","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Chadborn","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20189449","rel_title":"Mitigation Strategies and Compliance in the Covid-19 Fight; How Much Compliance is Enough?","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20189449","rel_abs":"Today, with only 4% of the world's population, the U.S. is bearing a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections. Seeking to understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Drilling down to the state level, we create specific state indices suitable for the U.S. to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. In this, we build on the Oxford Stringency Index. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator to reduce the transmission, is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states. These are New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one; this is the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. States successful in combating the pandemic were able to achieve a suitable combination. Understanding of this relationship by the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swati Mukerjee","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Clifton Chow","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Mingfei Li","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Ru-Yu Xia","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China"},{"author_name":"Lauren Towler","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Julia Groot","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Rachel Gledhill","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Merlin Willcox","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Ben Ainsworth","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Sascha Miller","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Moore","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Little","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Aml\u00f4t","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Chadborn","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20187666","rel_title":"Gastrointestinal involvement attenuates COVID-19 severity and mortality","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20187666","rel_abs":"Given that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a prominent extrapulmonary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated the impact of GI infection on disease pathogenesis in three large cohorts of patients in the United States and Europe. Unexpectedly, we observed that GI involvement was associated with a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality, with an accompanying reduction in key inflammatory proteins including IL-6, CXCL8, IL-17A and CCL28 in circulation. In a fourth cohort of COVID-19 patients in which GI biopsies were obtained, we identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) within small intestinal enterocytes for the first time in vivo but failed to obtain culturable virus. High dimensional analyses of GI tissues confirmed low levels of cellular inflammation in the GI lamina propria and an active downregulation of key inflammatory genes including IFNG, CXCL8, CXCL2 and IL1B among others. These data draw attention to organ-level heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis and highlight the role of the GI tract in attenuating SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation with related mortality benefit.","rel_num_authors":43,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra E Livanos","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Divya Jha","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Francesca Cossarini","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Ana S Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Minami Tokuyama","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tommaso L Parigi","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Irene Ramos","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Katie Dunleavy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Brian Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Dixon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Steven T Chen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Martinez-Delgado","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Satish Nagula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Jason Reidy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Steven Naymagon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Ari Grinspan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Jawad Ahmad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Michael Tankelevich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Ronald Gordon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Keshav Sharma","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Graham J Britton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Alice Chen-Liaw","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Spindler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tamar Plitt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Pei Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Andrea Cerutti","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY;

Methods: We performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary hospitals in Spain, from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by Inverse Probability of the Treatment Weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab effect in patients receiving steroids during the 48h following inclusion was analyzed. Results: During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days (IQR 8-14). Global mortality was 23.7%. Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls (16.8% versus 31.5%, HR 0.514 [95CI 0.355-0.744], p<0.001; weighted HR 0.741 [95CI 0.619-0.887], p=0.001). Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment (RRR 46.7%). We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone (10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 [95CI 0.352-0.741], p=0.036; weighted HR 0.6 [95CI 0.449-0.804], p<0.001) (Interaction p=0.094). Conclusions: These results show that survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those not treated, and that tocilizumab effect adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated cases with COVID-19 during the first 48 hours of presenting with respiratory failure despite of oxygen therapy. Randomised controlled studies are needed to confirm these results.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Belen Ruiz-Antoran","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Aranzazu Sancho-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ferran Torres","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic, Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Victor Moreno-Torres","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Itziar de Pablo Lopez de Abechuco","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal"},{"author_name":"Paulina Garcia Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Torrecardenas"},{"author_name":"Francisco Abad-Santos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Clara Maria Rosso Fernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio"},{"author_name":"Ana Aldea-Perona","author_inst":"Consorcio Parc Salut Mar"},{"author_name":"Eva Montane","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Germans Trias i Pujol"},{"author_name":"Ruth M Aparicio-Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de la Defensa Gomez Ulla"},{"author_name":"Roser LLop Rius","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge"},{"author_name":"Consuelo Pedros","author_inst":"Hospital General Universitari de Valencia"},{"author_name":"Paloma Gijon","author_inst":"Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez Carballo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Nuestra Senora Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Pedrosa Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerto Real"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Prada-Ramallal","author_inst":"Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Santiago de Compostela (FIDIS)"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Cabrera Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Clinico San Carlos"},{"author_name":"Josefa Andrea Aguilar Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Costa del Sol Marbella"},{"author_name":"Rocio Sanjuan-Jimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Iveth Ortiz Barraza","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal"},{"author_name":"Enrique Sanchez Chica","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ana Fernandez-Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"- TOCICOV-study group.","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Matthew P Spindler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tamar Plitt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Pei Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Andrea Cerutti","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY;

Coronavirus lead pandemic is a new found disease with no gold standard diagnostic and therapeutic guideline across the globe. Amidst this scenario our aim is to develop a prediction model that makes mass screening easy on par with reducing strain on hospitals diagnostic facility and doctors alike. For this prediction model, a neural network based on Chest X-ray images has been developed. Alongside the aim is also to generate a case record form that would include prediction model result along with few other subclinical factors for generating disease identification. Once found positive then only it will proceed to RT-PCR for final validation. The objective was to provide a cheap alternative to RT-PCR for mass screening and to reduced burden on diagnostic facility by keeping RT-PCR only for final confirmation. Methods: Datasets of chest X-ray images gathered from across the globe has been used to test and train the network after proper dataset curing and augmentation. Results: The final neural network-based prediction model showed an accuracy of 81% with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 90%. The AUC score obtained is 93.7%. Discussion and Conclusion: The above results based on the existing datasets showcase our model capability to successfully distinguish patients based on Chest X-ray (a non-invasive tool) and along with the designed case record form it can significantly contribute in increasing hospitals monitoring and health care capability.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akash Bararia","author_inst":"Tata Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Abhirup Ghosh","author_inst":"Jio Platforms Ltd, Navi Mumbai"},{"author_name":"Chiranjit Bose","author_inst":"IPGME&R and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Debarati Bhar","author_inst":"R.

Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality. Methods. We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings. Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received [&ge;]2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation. We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among patients who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J DeVito","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian MacKenna","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Morton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy P Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Schultze","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William J Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Richard Croker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henry Drysdale","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Medicine and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William G Dixon","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Noam Harpaz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Silvio Danese","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Nikhil A Kumta","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Alessio Aghemo","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Petralia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Mehandru","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20189860","rel_title":"Ongoing natural selection drives the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genomes","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20189860","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a new RNA virus affecting humans and spreads extensively through world populations since its first outbreak in late December, 2019. Whether the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is actively evolving, and driven by adaptation to the new host and environments is still unknown. Understanding the evolutionary mechanism underlying epidemiological and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 is essential for predicting the epidemic trend, and providing guidance for disease control and treatments. Interrogating 22,078 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of 84 countries, we demonstrate with convincing evidence that (i) SARS-CoV-2 genomes are overall conserved under purifying selection. (ii) Ongoing positive selection is actively driving the evolution of specific genes. Notably, genes related to coronavirus infection and host immune system defense are under adaptive evolution while genes related to viral RNA replication, transcription and translation are under purifying selection. A spatial and temporal landscape of 54 critical mutants is constructed based on their divergence among viral haplotype clusters, of which multiple mutants potentially conferring viral transmissibility, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Yali Hou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Yimin Bao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Yongbiao Xue","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Hua Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics"},{"author_name":"William J Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Richard Croker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henry Drysdale","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Medicine and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William G Dixon","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Noam Harpaz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Silvio Danese","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Nikhil A Kumta","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Alessio Aghemo","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Petralia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Mehandru","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20189597","rel_title":"COVID-19 control across urban-rural gradients","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20189597","rel_abs":"Controlling the regional re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 after its initial spread in ever-changing personal contact networks and disease landscapes is a challenging task. In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases, or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks, have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test and trace strategies, is pivotal to reduce the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an urban-rural gradient in epidemic size as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatics only. Our results emphasise the importance of test-and-tracing strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling COVID19 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Konstans Wells","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Lurgi","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Brendan Collins","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Policy, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GB, UK"},{"author_name":"Biagio Lucini","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Swansea University, Swansea SA2 8PP, Wales, UK"},{"author_name":"Rowland Raymond Kao","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alun L.

Available resource dynamics is governed by the well-known logistic growth model, in which the reproduction coefficient depends on the disease outbreak spreading dynamics. We further investigate the feedback interaction of the disease spread dynamics and resource growth dynamics with the premise that the quality of treatment depends on the current economic situation. The very inclusion of mortality rates and economic considerations in the same model may be incongruous under certain positions, but in this model, we take a 'realpolitik' approach by exploring all of these factors together as it is done in reality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S.

Methods: A public dataset of 1110 COVID-19 patients (1 CT\/patient) was used. Using CTs and clinical data, each patient was classified into mild, moderate, and severe by two observers: (1) dataset provider and (2) a board-certified radiologist. For each CT, 107 radiomic features were extracted. The dataset was randomly divided into a training (60%) and holdout validation (40%) set. During training, features were selected and combined into a logistic regression model for predicting severe cases from mild and moderate cases. The models were trained and validated on the classifications by both observers. AUC quantified the predictive power of models. To determine model robustness, the trained models was cross-validated on the inter-observer classifications. Results: A single feature alone was sufficient to predict mild from severe COVID-19 with AUC_valid^provider=0.85 and AUC_valid^radiologist=0.74 (p<<0.01). The most predictive features were the distribution of small size-zones (GLSZM-SmallAreaEmphasis) for provider classification and linear dependency of neighboring voxels (GLCM-Correlation) for radiologist classification. Cross-validation showed that both AUC_valid^ {approx}0.80 (p<<0.01). In predicting moderate from severe COVID-19, first-order-Median alone had sufficient predictive power of AUC_valid^provider=0.65 (p=0.01). For radiologist classification, the predictive power of the model increased to AUC_valid^radiologist=0.66 (p<<0.01) as the number of features grew from 1 to 5. Cross-validation yielded AUC_valid^radiologist=0.63 (p=0.002) and AUC_valid^provider=0.60 (p=0.09). Conclusions: Radiomics significantly predicted different levels of COVID-19 severity. The prediction was moderately sensitive to inter-observer classifications, and thus need to be used with caution.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen S.F.

When the COVID-19 pandemic let to closure of medical schools in these countries, the Bhutanese medical students were repatriated in March-April 2020. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and attitude as part of preparedness towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19. Method: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. This survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in 21-day facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and a convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1\/20. Cumulative score of score of >=80% was categorized as \"good knowledge\", score of >=60-79% was considered \"satisfactory knowledge\", and score <60% was considered \"poor knowledge.\" Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response were tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1. Results: 120 medical students responded to this survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilations and on the home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with duration of clinical clerkship (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported in only in 8.7%. Conclusions: The medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and were self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The students held positive attitude towards participation in the government's COVID-19 response.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thinley Dorji","author_inst":"Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital"},{"author_name":"Saran Tenzin Tamang","author_inst":"Faculty of Postgraduate Medicine, Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan, Thimphu"},{"author_name":"TVSVGK Tilak","author_inst":"Armed Forces Medical College, Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, India"},{"author_name":"John Kim","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Andrej Studen","author_inst":"University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"},{"author_name":"Luciano Rivetti","author_inst":"FUESMEN-FADESA, Mendoza, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Robert Jeraj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin, Madison"},{"author_name":"Mike B.

Using quantitative methods, we examined the advance of published research on ten of the vaccine technologies incorporated in the 165 candidate vaccines entering development through July 2020 as well as the NIH funding that supported this research. Live, attenuated virus, inactivated virus, and adjuvant technologies have been used in successful products since the 1950s and continue to exhibit steady advance. Synthetic (recombinant) vaccines, viral vectors, DNA, and TLR9 agonists as adjuvants emerged since the 1980s, and exhibit a logistic, \"S-curve\" pattern of growth characteristic of emerging technologies that have passed an analytically-defined established point. In contrast, mRNA, virus-like particle, and nanoparticle technologies show exponential growth characteristic of technologies short of their established points. The body of research and NIH funding for established and emerging vaccine technologies exhibited sustained growth through the late 2010s, supported by >16,000 thousand project years of NIH funding totaling over $17.2 billion (2000-2019), the majority through cooperative agreements and intramural programs. NIH funding for published research on vaccines for recognized zoonotic threats including coronavirus, Zika, Ebola, and dengue, however, has been inconsistent and reactive to disease outbreaks. These data are considered in the context of the high failure rate for candidate vaccines and evidence that technological maturity is a significant factor in the efficiency of product development. Sustained funding for both enabling technologies and vaccine development is essential to ensure a rapid response to COVID and future pandemic threats.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony E Kiszewski","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Ekaterina I Galkina Cleary","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Jackson","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Fred D Ledley","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Andrej Studen","author_inst":"University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"},{"author_name":"Luciano Rivetti","author_inst":"FUESMEN-FADESA, Mendoza, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Robert Jeraj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin, Madison"},{"author_name":"Mike B.

The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of six immunoassays to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: three lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), one ELISA and two chemiluminescence assays (CLIAs). Methods: We evaluated three LFAs (Alltest, One Step and SeroFlash), one ELISA (Dia.Pro) and two CLIAs (Elecsys and COV2T). To assess the specificity, 60 pre-pandemic sera were used. To evaluate the sensitivity, we used 80 serum samples from patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Agreement between techniques was evaluated using the kappa score (k). Results: All immunoassays showed a specificity of 100% except for SeroFlash (96.7%). Overall sensitivity was 61.3%, 73.8%, 67.5%, 85.9%, 88.0% and 92.0% for Alltest, One Step, SeroFlash, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T, respectively. Sensitivity increased throughout the first two weeks from the onset of symptoms, reaching sensitivities over 85% from 14 days for all LFAs, being One Step the most sensitive (97.6%), followed by SeroFlash (95.1%). Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T showed sensitivities over 97% from 14 days, being 100% for COV2T. One Step showed the best agreement results among LFAs, showing excellent agreement with Dia.Pro (agreement=94.2%, k=0.884), COV2T (99.1%, k=0.981) and Elecsys (97.3%, k=0.943). Dia.Pro, COV2T and Elecsys also showed excellent agreement between them. Conclusions: One Step, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T obtained the best diagnostic performance results. All these techniques showed a specificity of 100% and sensitivities over 97% from 14 days after the onset of symptoms, as well as excellent levels of agreement.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Ramon Perez-Tanoira","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Maria Esther Iglesias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Juan Romanyk","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Teresa Arroyo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Pena Gomez-Herruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Rosa Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Juan Cuadros-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Richard Croker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henry Drysdale","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Medicine and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William G Dixon","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Noam Harpaz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Silvio Danese","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Nikhil A Kumta","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Alessio Aghemo","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Petralia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Mehandru","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20191213","rel_title":"Airborne contamination of COVID-19 in hospitals: a scoping review of the current evidence.","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20191213","rel_abs":"Introduction A controversy remains worldwide regarding the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings. We reviewed the current evidence on the air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings, and the factors associated to the contamination including the viral load and the particles size. Methods The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science databases were systematically interrogated for original English-language articles detailing COVID-19 air contamination in hospital settings between 1 December 2019 and 21 July 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patient. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per m3 of air were pooled and their distribution were described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or TCID50 per m3 were analysed after categorization of sizes in <1 micrometers, 1-4 micrometers, and >4 micrometers. Results Among 2,034 records identified, 17 articles were included in the review. Overall, 27.5% (68\/247) of air sampled from close patients environment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, without difference according to the setting (ICU: 27\/97, 27.8%; non-ICU: 41\/150, 27.3%; p=0.93), the distance from patients (<1 meter: 1\/64, 1.5%; 1-5 meters: 4\/67, 6%; p=0.4). In other areas, the positivity rate was 23.8% (5\/21) in toilets, 9.5% (20\/221) in clinical areas, 12.4% (15\/121) in staff areas, and 34.1% (14\/41) in public areas. A total of 78 viral cultures were performed in three studies, and 3 (4%) were positive, all from close patients environment. The median SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.103 copies per m3 (IQR: 0.4.103-9.103) in clinical areas to 9.7.103 (5.1.103-14.3.103) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. The protective equipment removal and patients rooms had high concentrations\/titre of SARS-CoV-2 with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the <1 micrometers region, and staff offices in the >4 micrometers region. Conclusion In hospital, the air near and away from COVID-19 patients is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with however, rare proofs of their viability. High viral loads found in toilet\/bathrooms, staff and public hallways suggests to carefully consider these areas.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"GABRIEL BIRGAND","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nathan PEIFFER-SMADJA","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Sandra Fournier","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kerneis","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Francois Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Lucet","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Rosa Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Juan Cuadros-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Richard Croker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henry Drysdale","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Medicine and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William G Dixon","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Noam Harpaz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Silvio Danese","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Nikhil A Kumta","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Alessio Aghemo","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Petralia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Mehandru","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20180448","rel_title":"EARLY VIRAL CLEARANCE AMONG COVID-19 PATIENTS WHEN GARGLING WITH POVIDONE-IODINE AND ESSENTIAL OILS: A PILOT CLINICAL TRIAL","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20180448","rel_abs":"Background: Gargling had been reported to have significant roles in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of regular gargling to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Methodology: This pilot, open labeled, randomized, parallel study compared the effect of 30 seconds, 3 times\/day gargling using 1% povidone-iodine (PVP-I), essential oils and tap water on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Progress was monitored by day 4,6 and 12 PCR (Ct value), gargling and symptoms diary as well as clinical observations. Results: Five confirmed Stage 1 COVID-19 patients were recruited for each arm. The age range was from 22 to 56 years old. The majority were males. Two respondents had co-morbidities, which were asthma and obesity. Viral clearance was achieved at day 6 in 100%, 80%, 20% and 0% for 1% PVP-I, essential oils, tap water and control group respectively. Analysis of 1% PVP-I group versus control group showed significant p-value for comparison of PCR results on Day 4, Day 6 and Day 12. Conclusions: This preliminary study showed that gargling with 1% PVP-I and essential oils show great potential to be part of the treatment and management of Stage 1 COVID-19. Larger studies are required to ascertain the benefit of gargling for different stages of COVID-19 patients.
