Currently there are few treatment options and very few long-lasting disinfectants available to prevent the spread. While masks and protective clothing and social distancing may offer some protection, their use has not always halted or slowed the spread. Several vaccines are currently undergoing testing; however there is still a critical need to provide new methods for inactivating the virus before it can spread and infect humans. In the present study we examined the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by synthetic conjugated polymers and oligomers developed in our laboratories as antimicrobials for bacteria, fungi and non-enveloped viruses. Our results show that we can obtain highly effective light induced inactivation with several of these oligomers and polymers including irradiation with near-UV and visible light. With both the oligomers and polymers, we can reach several logs of inactivation with relatively short irradiation times. Our results suggest several applications involving the incorporation of these materials in wipes, sprays, masks and clothing and other Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) that can be useful in preventing infections and the spreading of this deadly virus and future outbreaks from similar viruses.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirk S Schanze","author_inst":"University of Texas at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"David G Whitten","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alison M Kell","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Eva Y Chi","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Linnea K Ista","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Florencia A Monge","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Pradeepkumar Jagadesan","author_inst":"University of Texas at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Virginie Bondu","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Patrick L Donabedian","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.06.20207597","rel_title":"Consideration for the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.06.20207597","rel_abs":"Objective: Worldwide countries are experiencing viral load in their population, leading to potential infectivity of asymptomatic COVID-19. Current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the role of asymptomatic infection worldwide reported in family-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers. Design: Online literature search (PubMed, Google Scholar, medRixv, and BioRixv) was accomplished using standard Boolean operators, studies published till 07th June 2020. Setting: Studies were included from case reports, short communication, and retrospective to cover sufficient asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission reported. Participants: Familial-clusters, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers. Results: We observed asymptomatic transmission among familial-cluster, adults, children, health care workers, and travelers with a proportion of 32% 37%, 26%, 6%, and 32%, respectively. This study observed an overall proportion of 31% (95%CI: 0.19-0.44) with heterogeneity of I2 (97.28%, p=<0.001) among all asymptomatic populations mentioned in this study. Among children and healthcare workers, this study showed no heterogeneity; to overcome the interpretation from a fixed model, the random effect model was also applied to estimate the average distribution across studies included in the meta-analysis. Conclusion: We found and suggest the rigorous epidemiological history, early isolation, social distancing, and increased quarantine period (at least 28 days) after screening asymptomatic cases as well as their close contacts for chest CT scan even after their negative nucleic acid testing to minimize the spread among the community. This systematic review and meta-analysis support asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission between person to person depending on the variation of virus incubation period among individuals. Children especially, school-going aged <18 years, need to be monitored and prevention strategy, e.g., chest CT and social distancing required to prevent the community transmission of COVID-19 in asymptomatic mode.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khaiwal Ravindra","author_inst":"PGIMER, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Vivek Singh Malik","author_inst":"Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh"},{"author_name":"Bijaya K Padhi","author_inst":"Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"},{"author_name":"Sonu Goel","author_inst":"Post graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh"},{"author_name":"Madhu Gupta","author_inst":"Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh"},{"author_name":"Florencia A Monge","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Pradeepkumar Jagadesan","author_inst":"University of Texas at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Virginie Bondu","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Patrick L Donabedian","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.01.20204214","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Inactivation Potential of Metal Organic Framework Induced Photocatalysis","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.01.20204214","rel_abs":"As the world recovers from the lockdown imposed by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, returning to shared indoor spaces is considered a formidable risk.

Several layering technologies are being explored to mitigate indoor transmission in the hopes of re-opening business, schools and transportation systems. Here we coupled the water adsorptive and photocatalytic capacity of novel Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to demonstrate the capture and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2.

The early symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. Therefore, during the epidemic, patients with similar symptoms will be tested for multiple pathogens at the same time. In order to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, China has taken many measures. Under this special situation, have the types and epidemic characteristics of respiratory viruses changed? The nucleic acid test results of influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as the antibody test results of 8 common respiratory viruses of Jinan Central Hospital were collected before and after the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and age distribution and time distribution characteristics were statisticed. Furthermore the epidemiological characteristics of this new virus before and after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was compared. In the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus nucleic acid test samples were large, and the positive rate of the three viruses was high. After that, the sample size and positive rate decreased significantly. No co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was found in our hospital. The sample size before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was larger than that after the outbreak, but the positive rate of the outbreak was lower than that after the outbreak. And the infection rate of children decreased in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. This is because since January 23, in order to prevent the spread of the new crown epidemic, my country has adopted measures such as wearing masks, not gathering together, and quarantining at home. This not only prevents the spread of the new crown virus, but also prevents the common respiratory tract. The spread of the virus has reduced the incidence of residents.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weihua Yang","author_inst":"Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Department of Chinese Medicine, Jinan central hospital affiliated to Shandong university"},{"author_name":"Mingjie Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory, Jinan central hospital affiliated to Shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory, Jinan central hospital affiliated to Shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Huanjie Li","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory, Jinan central hospital affiliated to Shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory, Jinan central hospital affiliated to Shandong first medical university;Shandong province key lab of tumor target molecule, Ji"},{"author_name":"Vicki L.

METHOD In a phase I randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial involving 192 healthy adults 18-59 years of age, two injections of three different doses (50 EU, 100 EU and 150 EU) of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or the placebo were administered intramuscularly with a 2- or 4-week interval between the injections. The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated within 28 days. FINDING In this study, 191 subjects assigned to three doses groups or the placebo group completed the 28-day trial. There were 44 adverse reactions within the 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue, and no abnormal variations were observed in 48 cytokines in the serum samples of immunized subjects. The serum samples diluted from 1:32 to 1:4096 and incubated with the virus did not show antibody-dependent enhancement effects (ADEs) with regard to human natural killer cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. At day 14, the seroconversion rates had reached 92%, 100% and 96% with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.0, 54.5 and 37.1, and at day 28, the seroconversion rates had reached 80%, 96% and 92% with GMTs of 10.6, 15.4 and 19.6in 0, 14 and 0, 28 procedures, respectively. Seroconversion was associated with the synchronous upregulation of ELISA antibodies against the S protein, N protein and virion and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Transcriptome analysis shaped the genetic diversity of immune response induced by the vaccine. INTERPRETATION In a population aged 18-59 years, this inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was safe and immunogenic.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Pu","author_inst":"Institute of

There is an urgent need to understand the molecular pathways required for host infection and anti-viral immunity. Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during active infection. Integration of this data with viral ChIRP-MS data from three other positive-sense RNA viruses defined pan-viral and SARS-CoV-2-specific host interactions. Functional interrogation of these factors with a genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the vast majority of viral RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and we identified known and novel anti-viral proteins that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Finally, our RNA-centric approach demonstrated a physical connection between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host mitochondria, which we validated with functional and electron microscopy data, providing new insights into a more general virus-specific protein logic for mitochondrial interactions. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform future studies to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, as well as nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.\n\nHighlights{middle dot} ChIRP-MS of SARS-CoV-2 RNA identifies a comprehensive viral RNA-host protein interaction network during infection across two species\n{middle dot} Comparison to RNA-protein interaction networks with Zika virus, dengue virus, and rhinovirus identify SARS-CoV-2-specific and pan-viral RNA protein complexes and highlights distinct intracellular trafficking pathways\n{middle dot} Intersection of ChIRP-MS and genome-wide CRISPR screens identify novel SARS-CoV-2-binding proteins with pro- and anti-viral function\n{middle dot} Viral RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions reveal specific SARS-CoV-2-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction during infection","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan A.

It is comprised of two major structural domains: the RNA binding domain, which interacts with viral and host RNA, and the oligomerization domain which assembles to form the viral core. Here, we investigate the assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA, implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes autoproteolytic processing within the linker region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms. We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We used mass spectrometry to show that N binds to a monoclonal antibody raised against full-length N. No antibody interactions were detected for N proteoforms without C-terminal residues, therefore locating antigenic regions towards the C-terminus. We then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. We propose that the proteoforms generated via autoproteolysis evade antibody detection through removal of the antigenic C-terminus and facilitate interactions with structured RNA or cyclophilin thereby enabling the virus to proliferate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Corinne A Lutomski","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tarick J El-Baba","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jani R Bolla","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol V Robinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cameron O.

Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack the autophagic process to allow their viral replication. One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philippe Halfon","author_inst":"Genoscience Pharma, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Eloine Bestion","author_inst":"Genoscience Pharma, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Keivan Zandi","author_inst":"Emory University and Children s Healthcare of Atlanta, Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA"},{"author_name":"Julien Andreani","author_inst":"IRD, MEPHI, IHU Mediterranee Infection, Aix Marseille Universite, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Pierre Baudoin","author_inst":"IRD, MEPHI, IHU Mediterranee Infection, Aix Marseille Universite, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Jean-Louis Mege","author_inst":"IRD, MEPHI, IHU Mediterranee Infection, Aix Marseille Universite, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Soraya Mezouar","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Raymond F Schinazi","author_inst":"Emory University and Children s Healthcare of Atlanta, Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA"},{"author_name":"Kevin R.

To understand the differences between antibody responses in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and VH3-53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike. Finally, we used combinations of nAbs targeting different immune-sites to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires revealed that the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs. We demonstrate that severe COVID-19 is associated with unique BCR signatures and multi-clonal neutralizing responses that are relatively frequent in the population. Moreover, our data support the use of combination antibody therapy to prevent and treat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Mor","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Michal Werbner","author_inst":"Bar-Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Joel Alter","author_inst":"Bar-Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Modi Safra","author_inst":"Bar-Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Elad Chomsky","author_inst":"ImmunAi"},{"author_name":"Smadar Hada-Neeman","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Polonsky","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Cameron Nowell","author_inst":"Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alex Clark","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Anna Roitburd-Berman","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Noam Ben-Shalom","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Michal Navon","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Dor Rafael","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Hila Sharim","author_inst":"ImmunAi"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Kiner","author_inst":"ImmunAi"},{"author_name":"Eric Griffis","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Importantly, these differences in NES strength were not related to strain pathogenicity. Rather, we found that the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus were markedly stronger than the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus.\n\nWe conclude that, while some of the genomic features recently identified in silico could be crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity, this does not appear to be the case of nucleocapsid NES activity, as it is more closely related to coronavirus genus than to pathogenic capacity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Sendino","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV\/EHU), Leioa 48940, Spain"},{"author_name":"Miren Josu Omaetxebarria","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV\/EHU), Leioa 48940, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose A Rodriguez","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV\/EHU), Leioa 48940, Spain"},{"author_name":"Modi Safra","author_inst":"Bar-Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Elad Chomsky","author_inst":"ImmunAi"},{"author_name":"Smadar Hada-Neeman","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Polonsky","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Cameron Nowell","author_inst":"Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alex Clark","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Anna Roitburd-Berman","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Noam Ben-Shalom","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Michal Navon","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Dor Rafael","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Hila Sharim","author_inst":"ImmunAi"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Kiner","author_inst":"ImmunAi"},{"author_name":"Eric Griffis","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. The 2.6 [A] cryo-EM structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites of suramin, with one site directly blocking the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clash with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells.

We examined the functional and structural consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model. SARS-CoV-2 replication caused a transient decrease in epithelial barrier function and disruption of tight junctions, though viral particle crossing remained limited. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication led to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss and misorientation of remaining basal bodies. The motile cilia function was compromised, as measured in a mucociliary clearance assay. Epithelial defense mechanisms, including basal cell mobilization and interferon-lambda induction, ramped up only after the initiation of cilia damage. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters further demonstrated the loss of motile cilia in vivo. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"R\u00e9my Robinot","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Hubert","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Dias de Melo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7oise Lazarini","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timoth\u00e9e Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nika\u00efa Smith","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Levallois","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Florence Larrous","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Julien Fernandes","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Stacy Gellenoncourt","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Rigaud","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Gorgette","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Thouvenot","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9line Tr\u00e9beau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Dumenil","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Adeline Mallet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samy Gobaa","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rapha\u00ebl Etournay","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Marie Lledo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Lecuit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Herv\u00e9 Bourhy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Darragh Duffy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Michel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ben A.

Coronavirus (CoV) virions contain single-stranded RNA genomes with a lipid envelope and 4 proteins, 3 of which are associated with the lipid envelope and thus are thought to be easily denatured by heat or surfactant-type chemicals. Prior studies have shown that a temperature of as low as 75 {degrees}C and treatment duration of 15 min can effectively inactivate CoV. The applicability of a CoV heat inactivation method greatly depends on the length of time of a heat treatment and the temperature needed to inactivate the virus. With the goal of finding conditions where sub-second heat exposure of CoV can sufficiently inactivate CoV, we designed and developed a simple system that can measure sub-second heat inactivation of CoV. The system is composed of capillary stainless-steel tubing immersed in a temperature-controlled oil bath followed by an ice bath, through which virus solution can be flowed at various speeds. Flowing virus solution at different speeds, along with a real-time temperature monitoring system, allows the virus to be accurately exposed to a desired temperature for various durations of time. Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a beta-coronavirus, as a model system, we identified that 85.2 {degrees}C for 0.48 s exposure is sufficient to obtain > 5 Log10 reduction in viral titer (starting titer: 5 x 107 PFU\/mL), and that when exposed to 83.4 {degrees}C for 0.95 s, the virus was completely inactivated (zero titer, > 6 Log10 reduction).\n\nIMPORTANCEThree coronaviruses (CoVs) have now caused global outbreaks within the past 20 years, with the COVID19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 still ongoing. Methods that can rapidly inactivate viruses, especially CoVs, can play critical roles in ensuring public safety and safeguarding personal health. Heat treatment of viruses to inactive them can be an efficient and inexpensive method, with the potential to be incorporated into various human-occupied spaces. In this work, a simple system that can heat-treat viruses for extremely short period was developed and utilized to show that sub-second exposure of CoV to heat is sufficient to inactivate CoV. This opens up the possibility of developing instruments and methods of disinfecting CoV in diverse settings, including rapid liquid disinfection and airborne virus disinfection. The developed method can also be broadly utilized to assess heat sensitivity of viruses other viral pathogens of interest and develop sub-second rapid heat inactivation approaches.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuqian Jiang","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Han Zhang","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Jose A.

The method uses fluorescent sensors (i.e. molecular beacons) designed to detect COVID-19 RNA or any RNA of interest, concurrent with an internal control without the need for amplification. The molecular beacons are stem-loop structures in which a ~10 nucleotide loop region has the complementary sequence of a region of the target RNA, and a fluorophore and quencher are placed on the 5' and 3' ends of the stem. The energy of hybridization of the loop with its target is designed to be greater than the hybridization energy of the energy of the stem so that when the beacon encounters its target RNA, the structure opens resulting in dequenching of the fluorophore. Here, we designed a COVID-19 beacon that is completely quenched in its native form and undergoes a 50-fold increase in fluorescence when exposed to nanomolar amounts of synthetic viral oligonucleotide. No changes in intensity are seen when control RNA is added. A control beacon to a human GAPDH RNA, chosen for its high levels in saliva, behaved similar to the COVID-19 beacon. This increase in fluorescence with beacon opening can be completely reversed upon addition of single stranded DNA complementary to COVID-19 beacon loop region. Beacons can be attached to an insert matrix allowing their use in concentrated form and can be made from morphilino oligonucleotides that are resistant to RNases. We present an analysis of the parameters that will allow the development of test strips to detect virus in aerosol, body fluids and community waste.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suzanne Scarlata","author_inst":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"V Siddartha Yerramilli","author_inst":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Lothar Hennighausen","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH"},{"author_name":"Marco R.

Using all patients diagnosed on testing in a single regional laboratory, we identified 1137 subjects with PCR positive for SARS-COV2 and at least one available complete blood count from the decade prior to any possible exposure to the virus. Bivariate analysis indicated an association between pre-existing lymphocytopenia (defined as absolute lymphocyte count <0.9x109 \/L) and fatality (18% versus 4%). Furthermore, a logistic regression model, accounting for both patient age and number of blood counts obtained, indicated the subjects with pre-existing lymphocytopenia were 1.4 times as likely to die. Because the absolute lymphocyte count is almost universally available and easily interpreted, this biomarker of the risk of fatality could be widely useful.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Burack","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Philip Rock","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"David Burtoon","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Xueya Cai","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Susan Daniel","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Gary R.

We found a myeloid cell-dominated conserved host response associated with severity. It showed increased hematopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells with increased severity. We identified four gene modules that delineate distinct trajectories associated with mild and severe outcomes, and show the interferon response was decoupled from protective host response during severe viral infection. These modules distinguished non-severe from severe viral infection with clinically useful accuracy. Together, our findings provide insights into immune response dynamics during viral infection, and identify factors that may influence patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Zheng","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Aditya M Rao","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Denis Dermadi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jiaying Toh","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lara Murphy Jones","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Donato","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yiran Liu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yapeng Su","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Minas Karagiannis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Theodoros Marantos","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Yehudit Hasin-Brumshtein","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yudong D He","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Jim Heath","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Purvesh Khatri","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adeline Mallet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samy Gobaa","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rapha\u00ebl Etournay","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Marie Lledo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Lecuit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Herv\u00e9 Bourhy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Darragh Duffy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Michel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ben A.

However, the mechanism of these relationships is unclear, and prognostic biomarkers for the disease and its systemic complications are lacking. This study aims to examine the plasma protein profile of COVID-19 patients and evaluate overlapping protein modules with biomarkers of common comorbidities. Blood samples were collected from COVID-19 cases (n=307) and negative controls (n=78) among patients with acute respiratory distress. Proteins were measured by proximity extension assay utilizing next-generation sequencing technology. Its associations to COVID-19 disease characteristics were compared to that of preexisting conditions and established biomarkers for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and chronic kidney disease. Several proteins were differentially expressed in COVID-19, including multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma, CXCL10, and CCL7\/MCP-3. Elevated IL-6 was associated with increased severity, while baseline IL1RL1\/ST2 levels were associated with a worse prognosis. Network analysis identified several protein modules associated with COVID-19 disease characteristics overlapping with processes of preexisting hypertension and impaired kidney function. BNP and NTpro-BNP, markers for MI and stroke, increased with disease progression and were positively associated with severity. MMP12 was similarly elevated and has been previously linked to smoking and inflammation in emphysema, along with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In conclusion, this study provides an overview of the systemic effects of COVID-19 and candidate biomarkers for clinical assessment of disease progression and the risk of systemic complications.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesse Huang","author_inst":"Karolinska Insitutet"},{"author_name":"Aditya M Rao","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Denis Dermadi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jiaying Toh","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lara Murphy Jones","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Donato","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yiran Liu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yapeng Su","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Minas Karagiannis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Theodoros Marantos","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Yehudit Hasin-Brumshtein","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yudong D He","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Jim Heath","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Purvesh Khatri","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adeline Mallet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samy Gobaa","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rapha\u00ebl Etournay","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Marie Lledo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Lecuit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Herv\u00e9 Bourhy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Darragh Duffy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Michel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ben A.

As such, when outbreaks occur in foreign states, pressure mounts to reduce the risk of importing cases to the home nation. In a previous paper, we developed a model to investigate the potential effectiveness of deploying screening at airports during outbreaks of influenza, SARS, and Ebola. We also applied the model to the current COVID-19 outbreak. This model simulated the testing of travellers (assumed not to be displaying symptoms prior to boarding their flight) as they arrived at their destination. The model showed that the reduction in risk of case importation that screening alone could deliver was minimal across most scenarios considered, with outputs indicating that screening alone could detect at most 46.4%, 12.9%, and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and Ebola respectively, while the model also reported a detection rate of 12.0% for COVID-19. In this paper, we present a brief modification to this model allowing us to assess the added impact that quarantining incoming travelers for various periods may have on reducing the risk of case importation. Primary results show that requiring all travellers to undergo 5 days of self-isolation on arrival, after which they are tested again, has the potential to increase rates of detection to 100%, 87.6%, 81.7% and 41.3% for travellers infected with influenza, SARS, COVID-19 and Ebola respectively. Extending the period of self-isolation to 14 days increases these potential detection rates to 100%, 100%, 99.5% and 91.8% respectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Declan Bays","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Finnie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Efren Murillo-Zamora","author_inst":"Mexican Institute of Social Security"},{"author_name":"Lara Murphy Jones","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Donato","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yiran Liu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yapeng Su","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Minas Karagiannis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Theodoros Marantos","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Yehudit Hasin-Brumshtein","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yudong D He","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Jim Heath","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Purvesh Khatri","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adeline Mallet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samy Gobaa","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rapha\u00ebl Etournay","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Marie Lledo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Lecuit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Herv\u00e9 Bourhy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Darragh Duffy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Michel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ben A.

Our methods accommodate the differences in demographics between Germany and the US. We match cumulative incidence of COVID-19 deaths by age group in Germany to non-Hispanic whites in the US and project the implied number of deaths in this population and among the black and Hispanic populations under observed racial\/ethnic disparities in cumulative COVID-19 mortality in the US. We estimate that if the US had been as successful as Germany in managing the pandemic we would have expected 22% of the deaths actually recorded. The number of deaths would have been lower by a further one-third if we could have eliminated racial\/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. We conclude that almost 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in the US by September 22nd could have been avoided with an early and effective response producing similar age-specific death rates among non-Hispanic whites as in Germany.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruth Etzioni","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Washington"},{"author_name":"Elan Markowitz","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Ivor S Douglas","author_inst":"Pulmonary, Sleep and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Denver Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Efren Murillo-Zamora","author_inst":"Mexican Institute of Social Security"},{"author_name":"Lara Murphy Jones","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Donato","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yiran Liu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yapeng Su","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Minas Karagiannis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Theodoros Marantos","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Yehudit Hasin-Brumshtein","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yudong D He","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc"},{"author_name":"Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Jim Heath","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Purvesh Khatri","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adeline Mallet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samy Gobaa","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rapha\u00ebl Etournay","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Marie Lledo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Lecuit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Herv\u00e9 Bourhy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Darragh Duffy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Michel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ben A.

Using logistic regression and controlling for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, age, sex or ethnicity, we find that individuals with pre-existing metabolic syndrome (measured on average eleven years prior to 2020) have an increased risk for COVID-19-related death (odds ratio 1.67).

Subsequent concentration-response studies using a high-throughput antiviral assay, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed that pretreatment and treatment with extracts, artemisinin, and artesunate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. In treatment assays, artesunate (50% effective concentration (EC50): 7 g\/mL) was more potent than the tested plant extracts (128-260 g\/mL) or artemisinin (151 g\/mL) and artemether (>179 g\/mL), while generally EC50 in pretreatment assays were slightly higher. The selectivity index (SI), calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, was highest for artemisinin (54), and roughly equal for the extracts (5-10), artesunate (6) and artemether (<7). Similar results were obtained in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. Peak plasma concentrations of artesunate exceeding EC50 values can be achieved.

Objective: To track the early course of the pandemic by examining self-reported COVID symptoms over time before testing became widely available. Design: Adults from the nationally representative Angus Reid Forum were randomly invited to complete an online survey in May\/June 2020. The study is a part of the Action to Beat Coronavirus antibody testing study. Setting: A 20-item internet survey. Participants: 14,408 adults age 18 years of age. Exposures: The months that respondents and any household members first experienced various respiratory, neurological, sleep, skin or gastric symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measure: COVID symptom-positive, defined as fever (or fever with hallucinations) plus at least one of difficulty breathing, a dry severe cough, loss of smell or COVID toe. Results: In total, 14,408 panel members (48% male and 52% female) completed the survey. Despite overrepresentation of higher levels of education, the prevalence of obesity, smoking, diabetes and hypertension were similar to national census and health surveys. A total of 811 (5.6%) were COVID symptom-positive; highest rates were at ages 18-44 years (8.3% among), declining at older ages. Females had higher odds of reporting COVID symptoms (OR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.11-1.56) as did visible minorities (OR = 1.74, 1.29-2.35). COVID symptom positivity for respondents and their household members peaked in March (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.59-2.34 compared to earlier months). Conclusions and Relevance: This study enhances our current understanding of the progression of the COVID epidemic in Canada, with few laboratory-confirmed cases in January and February, peaking in April. The results suggest substantial viral transmission in March, before widespread testing began, and a gradual decline in cases since May.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuyang Tang","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research"},{"author_name":"Hellen Gelband","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research"},{"author_name":"Teresa Lam","author_inst":"Angus Reid Forum"},{"author_name":"Nico Nagelkerke","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research"},{"author_name":"Angus Reid","author_inst":"Angus Reid Forum"},{"author_name":"Prabhat Jha","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"- Action to beat Coronavirus (Ab-C) Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Jakob Trimpert","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jens Bukh","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen and Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Klaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Judith Gottwein","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Peter H Seeberger","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces"},{"author_name":"Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Jim Heath","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Purvesh Khatri","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adeline Mallet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samy Gobaa","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rapha\u00ebl Etournay","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Marie Lledo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Lecuit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Herv\u00e9 Bourhy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Darragh Duffy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Michel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ben A.

Collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) by healthcare workers (HCW) is currently used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of transmission to HCWs. Self-administered saliva and buccal swabs are convenient, painless and safe alternative sample collection methods. Methods: A cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 participants who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS within the past 7 days. A self-collected saliva and buccal swab and a HCW-collected NPS were obtained. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for saliva and buccal swabs, as compared with NPS. Results: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31\/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7% and OA 69.0%. The buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100% and OA 73.8%. Presence of symptoms improved diagnostic accuracy. There was no statistically significant association between CT values and duration of symptom onset within the first 12 days of symptoms for all three modalities. Conclusion: Self-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs have only moderate agreement with HCW-collected NPS swabs. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives. This combined strategy minimizes discomfort and reduces the risk of spread to the community and HCWs.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chee Wai Ku","author_inst":"KK Women's and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shivani Durai","author_inst":"KK Women's and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Q T Kwan","author_inst":"National University Singapore"},{"author_name":"See Ling Loy","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christina Erwin","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Karrie K K Ko","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wen Ng","author_inst":"KK Womens and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette Oon","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Koh Cheng Thoon","author_inst":"KK Women's and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shirin Kalimuddin","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jerry KY Chan","author_inst":"KK Women's and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter H Seeberger","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces"},{"author_name":"Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Jim Heath","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Purvesh Khatri","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adeline Mallet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samy Gobaa","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rapha\u00ebl Etournay","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Marie Lledo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Lecuit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Herv\u00e9 Bourhy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Darragh Duffy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Michel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ben A.

To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age [&ge;] 18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to 5 non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. Results: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18%) were hospitalized, 107 (4%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3%) died. The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 0.99 (95% Confidence Internal 0.80, 1.22) for hospitalization, 0.69 (95% Confidence Internal 0.36, 1.29) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.30 (95% Confidence Internal 0.11, 0.80) for death. Conclusions: In this matched cohort study from a large Boston-based healthcare system, asthma was associated with comparable risk of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation but a lower risk of mortality.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lacey B.
