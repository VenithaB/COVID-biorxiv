Accumulating evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 in animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8\/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8\/A9 and noncanonical neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qirui Guo","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yingchi Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Junhong Li","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese"},{"author_name":"Jiangning Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese"},{"author_name":"Fuping You","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xuefei Guo","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Zeming Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lili Cao","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yujie Luo","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Luoying Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Hua Zhu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Ran Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.288555","rel_title":"Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization by Secretory IgA in vitro","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.288555","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces.

Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 individuals. IgA responses in plasma generally correlate with IgG responses and clones of IgM, IgG and IgA producing B cells that are derived from common progenitors are evident. Plasma IgA monomers are 2-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form in the nasopharynx, are on average 15 times more potent than IgA monomers. Thus, secretory IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Julio C C Lorenzi","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Frauke Muecksch","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Finkin","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Viant","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Christian Gaebler","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffman","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Thiago Y Oliveira","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Deena A Oren","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Victor Ramos","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Lilian Nogueira","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Charles M Rice","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.289850","rel_title":"Transcriptomic dysregulations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in human nasopharyngeal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.289850","rel_abs":"IntroductionOver 24 million people have been infected globally with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, with more than 820,000 succumbing to the resulting COVID-19 disease as of the end of August 2020. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease are not completely elucidated. Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls.\n\nMethodsWe used two publicly available gene expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were also determined.\n\nResultsWe found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription. Host response in COVID-19 subjects for the PBMC group, involved upregulation of genes involved in the complement system and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. CXCL13, GABRE, IFITM3 were upregulated and HSPA1B was downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample groups.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is compartmentalized and suggests potential biomarkers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nHighlightsO_LITranscriptomic profiling from publicly available RNA-seq count data revealed a site-specific immune response in COVID-19.\nC_LIO_LIHost response was found cellular-mediated in nasopharyngeal samples and humoral-mediated in PBMCs samples.\nC_LIO_LICXCL13, GABRE and IFITM3 commonly upregulated and HSPA1B downregulated in both sample groups highlights the potential of these molecules as markers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caroline Vilas Boas Melo","author_inst":"Laboratory of Structural and Molecular Pathology, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal - Salvador, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Maruf Ahmed Bhuiyan","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Shahbag, Dhaka, 1000, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Winfred Nyoroka Gatua","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Pwani University, P.O.BOX 195-80108 KILIFI, Kenya; Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Unit, International Centre"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kanyerezi","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Molecular biology, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University.

Virus utilizes multiple receptors for attachment, entry, or specific host responses. However, other than ACE2, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Furthermore, ACE2 cannot easily interpret the multi-organ tropisms of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To identify host cell receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 interactions, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen almost all human membrane proteins, with SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein as the target. Twelve receptors were identified, including ACE2. Most receptors bind at least two domains on S protein, the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and the N-terminal-domain (NTD), suggesting both are critical for virus-host interaction. Ectopic expression of ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient to enable entry of SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Analyzing single-cell transcriptome profiles from COVID-19 patients revealed that virus susceptibility in airway epithelial ciliated and secretory cells and immune macrophages highly correlates with expression of ACE2, KREMEN1 and ASGR1 respectively, and ACE2\/ASGR1\/KREMEN1 (ASK) together displayed a much better correlation than any individual receptor. Based on modeling of systemic SARS-CoV-2 host interactions through S receptors, we revealed ASK correlation with SARS-CoV-2 multi-organ tropism and provided potential explanations for various COVID-19 symptoms. Our study identified a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptors with diverse binding properties, biological functions, and clinical correlations or implications, including ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as the alternative entry receptors, providing insights into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with host, as well as a useful resource and potential drug targets for COVID-19 investigation.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunqing Gu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Cao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinyu Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hai Gao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jia Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jinlan Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghui Shen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xichen Zheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianqing Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Lan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Min Luo","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Khatendra Reang","author_inst":"Hislop College, Biochemistry Department, Chitnavis Centre, Temple Rd, Dobhi Nagar, Civil Lines, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440001."},{"author_name":"Akadiri Olalekan","author_inst":"Biotechnology, Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi Lagos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.286732","rel_title":"Rapid, high-yield production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain by transient gene expression in CHO cells","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.286732","rel_abs":"Recombinant forms of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses have proven difficult to produce with good yields in mammalian cells. Given the panoply of potential COVID-19 diagnostic tools and therapeutic candidates that require purified spike protein and its importance for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research, we have explored new approaches for spike production and purification. Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHOBRI\/rcTA cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated\/stabilized form (to favor expression of the full-length spike in prefusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg\/L. The speed and productivity of this method support further development of CHO-based approaches for recombinant spike protein manufacturing.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Stuible","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Simon Lord-Dufour","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Perret","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Joseph Schrag","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Gilles St-Laurent","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Yves Durocher","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Guanghui Shen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xichen Zheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianqing Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Lan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Min Luo","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Khatendra Reang","author_inst":"Hislop College, Biochemistry Department, Chitnavis Centre, Temple Rd, Dobhi Nagar, Civil Lines, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440001."},{"author_name":"Akadiri Olalekan","author_inst":"Biotechnology, Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi Lagos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.289355","rel_title":"Tracking SARS-CoV-2 T cells with epitope T-cell receptor recognition models","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.289355","rel_abs":"Much is still not understood about the human adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.

This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike\/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these results with the current mutational status of these amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 10 distinct patients: N439K, G476S, S477N and N501Y. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V.\n\nSignificance StatementWe developed a method to identify key amino acids responsible for the initial interaction between SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and human cells, through the analysis of Spike\/ACE2 complexes. We further identified which of these amino acids show variants in the viral and human populations. Our results will facilitate scientists and clinicians alike in identifying the possible role of present and future Spike and ACE2 sequence variants in cell entry and general susceptibility to infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Ortuso","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University \"Magna Graecia\" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Mercatelli","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Hiram Guzzi","author_inst":"Department of Surgical and Medical Sciences, University \"Magna Graecia\" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Manuel Giorgi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sai D Prasad","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Srinivas Vellimudu","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Krishna M Ella","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Rajaram Ravikrishnan","author_inst":"RCC Labs"},{"author_name":"Amit Awasthi","author_inst":"THSTI"},{"author_name":"Jomy Jose","author_inst":"RCC Labs"},{"author_name":"Panduranga Rao","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kumar","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Raches Ella","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech International Limited"},{"author_name":"Priya Abraham","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology, Pune"},{"author_name":"Pragya Yadav","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Gajanan N Sapkal","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Anita Shete","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Gururaj Rao Desphande","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Sreelekshmy Mohandas","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Atanu Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.285007","rel_title":"Brain volumetric changes in the general population following the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.285007","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak introduced unprecedented health-risks, as well as pressure on the financial, social, and psychological well-being due to the response to the outbreak1-4.

Here, we report the crystal structure of the globular domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, encompassing residues 13 to 127, at a resolution of 1.65 [A]. Our structure features a six-stranded, capped {beta}-barrel motif similar to Nsp1from SARS-CoV and reveals how variations in amino acid sequence manifest as distinct structural features. Through comparative analysis of structural homologues, we identified a topological signature associated with this protein fold that facilitated modeling of Nsp1 from MERS-CoV. Combining our high-resolution crystal structure with existing data on the C-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, we propose a model of the full-length protein.

The statistical relationships of total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths per million populations in these countries with 10 demographic, economic and social indicators (indices) were studied. These indicators are Life Expectancy, Median Age, Growth Rate, Population Density, GDP PPP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), Gini index of income equality, Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and Democracy Index. Statistically significant relationships were found with all indicators excluding Gini index and Population Density. We have found that the closest is the relationship of Deaths per million population and total Cases per million population with correlation coefficient R = 0.926. Therefore, it is clear statistically that the more are Cases per million in a country the more are Deaths per million. This confirms the correctness of the timely and effective introduction of the necessary pandemic restrictions in the countries. It is interesting that the close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a purely economic index like GDP PPP per capita, where R = 0.687 and R = 0.660, respectively. Even more close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a composite index HDI, where the correlation coefficients reach 0.724 and 0.680, respectively. This paradoxical results show that the richest and well-being countries are most seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most probable reason for this is the large percentage of aging population, comorbidity of population with severe chronic diseases and obesity in countries with high GDP and HDI. No less important reason appears the delayed and\/or insufficiently effective pandemic restrictions in these countries, which have underestimated the danger of a pandemic in early stage. Other indicators (excluding Gini index and Population Density) also show statistically significant correlations with Cases and Deaths per 1 million with correlation coefficients from 0.432 to 0.634. The countries that deviates the most from the regression lines were shown. Surprisingly, there was no statistically significant correlation between Cases and Deaths with Population Density. The statistical significance of the found correlations determined using Student's t-test was p <0.0001. The countries that deviate the most from both sides of the regression line were shown.

Proactive testing of asymptomatic individuals is therefore a powerful, and probably necessary, tool for preventing widespread infection in many settings. This paper explores the effectiveness of alternative testing regimes, in which the frequency, the accuracy, and the delay between testing and results determine the time path of infection. For a simple model of disease transmission, we present analytic formulas that determine the effect of testing on the expected number of days of during which an infectious individual is exposed to the population at large. This allows us to estimate the frequency of testing that would be required to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks, and to explore the trade-offs between frequency, accuracy, and delay in achieving this objective. We conclude by discussing applications to outbreak control on college and university campuses.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ted Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Carl T.

This picture contrasts with the discrete representation of n and t underlying the real epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for which a description based on finite difference equations would be more adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position Tc1\/2 obtained within the continuous time representation is systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position Td1\/2 predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift {tau} {equiv} Tc1\/2 - Td1\/2 < 0 is basically insensitive to changes in infection rate {kappa}. For a broad range of {kappa} values deduced from COVID-19 data at extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we found a rather robust estimate {tau} {approx} -2.65 day-1. Being obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results apply to logistic growth in general without any limitation to a specific real system.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioan Baldea","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Carl T.

Methods: We used plasma from 118 adult patients who have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 49 patients under investigation without infection, 20 patients with other respiratory infections, and 102 healthy controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from Euroimmun. The optical density ratio cut off for positive test was 1.1 for IgA and 0.8 for IgG. The association of antibody response with the severity of diseases and the day of symptoms was performed. Results: From Mar 10 to May 31, 2020, 289 participants were enrolled, and 384 samples were analyzed. Patients were categorized by clinical manifestations to mild (n=59), moderate (n=27) and severe (n=32). The overall sensitivity of IgA and IgG from samples collected after day 7 is 87.9% (95% CI 79.8-93.6) and 84.8% (95% CI 76.2-91.3), respectively. The severe group had a significantly higher level of specific IgA and IgG to S1 antigen compared to the mild group. All moderate to severe patients have specific IgG while 20% of the mild group did not have any IgG detected after two weeks. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was significantly higher in males compared to females among the severe group (p=0.003).

Objective To determine whether the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality are associated with ethnicity. Data Sources We searched all English language articles published 1st December 2019 - 30th June 2020 within MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROSPERO and the Cochrane library using indexing terms for COVID-19 and ethnicity, as well as manuscripts awaiting peer review on MedRxiv during the same period. Study Selection Included studies reported original clinical data, disaggregated by ethnicity, on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. We excluded correspondence, area level, modelling and basic science articles. Two independent reviewers screened articles for inclusion. Of 926 identified articles, 35 were included in the meta-analyses. Data Extraction and Synthesis The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Reviewers independently extracted data using a piloted form on: (1) rates of infection, ICU admission and mortality by ethnicity; and (2) unadjusted and adjusted data comparing ethnic minority and White groups. Data were pooled using random effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were: (1) infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed on molecular testing; (2) ICU admission; and (3) mortality in COVID-19 confirmed and suspected cases. Results 13,535,562 patients from 35 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Black, Asian and Hispanic individuals had a greater risk of infection compared to White individuals (Black: pooled adjusted RR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.59-2.67; Asian: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59; Hispanic: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.39-2.25). Black individuals were significantly more likely to be admitted to ICU than White individuals (pooled adjusted RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02-2.55). Risk of mortality was similar across ethnicities among hospitalised patients, but increased among Asian and Mixed ethnic groups in the general population. Conclusions Black, Asian and Hispanic ethnic groups are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Black individuals may be more likely to require ICU admission for COVID-19. There may also be disparities in risk of death from COVID-19 at a population level. Our findings are of critical public health importance and should inform policy on minimising SARS-CoV-2 exposure in ethnic minority groups.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shirley Sze","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Daniel Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Laura J Gray","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Clareece R Nevill","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Christopher A Martin","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Joshua Nazareth","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Jatinder S Minhas","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Pip Divall","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Keith Abrams","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Laura B Nellums","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Yaniv Assaf","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Priya Abraham","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology, Pune"},{"author_name":"Pragya Yadav","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Gajanan N Sapkal","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Anita Shete","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Gururaj Rao Desphande","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Sreelekshmy Mohandas","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Atanu Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.06.20189159","rel_title":"Kynurenic acid underlies sex-specific immune responses to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.06.20189159","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has poorer clinical outcomes in males compared to females, and immune responses underlie these sex-related differences in disease trajectory. As immune responses are in part regulated by metabolites, we examined whether the serum metabolome has sex-specificity for immune responses in COVID-19. In males with COVID- 19, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA to kynurenine (K) ratio was positively correlated with age, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and was negatively correlated with T cell responses, revealing that KA production is linked to immune responses in males. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K ratio than those that stabilized. In females with COVID-19, this ratio positively correlated with T cell responses and did not correlate with age or clinical severity. KA is known to inhibit glutamate release, and we observed that serum glutamate is lower in patients that deteriorate from COVID-19 compared to those that stabilize, and correlates with immune responses. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data revealed that expression of kynurenine aminotransferase, which regulates KA production, correlates most strongly with cytokine levels and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes, in COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuping Cai","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Kim","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takehiro Takahashi","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David I Broadhurst","author_inst":"Centre for Integrative Metabolomics & Computational Biology, School of Science, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, 6027, Australia"},{"author_name":"Shuangge Ma","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J.W Rattray","author_inst":"Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow G4 0RE, UK."},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine;Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale University School of Medic"},{"author_name":"Jon Klein","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Lucas","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Mao","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Moore","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Muenker","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Julio Silva","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wong","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Yale IMPACT Research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Albert J Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.05.20184655","rel_title":"Activin\/Follistatin-axis deregulation is independently associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.05.20184655","rel_abs":"Rationale: Activins are inflammatory and tissue-repair-related members of the TGF{beta}-superfamily that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several immuno-inflammatory disorders including sepsis\/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that they might be of particular relevance to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Objectives: To assess the involvement of the Activin-Follistatin-axis in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Methods: Levels of Activins -A, -B and their physiological inhibitor Follistatin, were retrospectively analyzed in 314 serum samples from 117 COVID-19 patients derived from two independent centers and compared with common demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Optimal-scaling with ridge-regression was used to screen variables and establish a prediction model. Main Results: The Activin\/Follistatin-axis was significantly deregulated during the course of COVID-19 and was independently associated with severity and in-hospital mortality. FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel disease scoring system, adding one point for each of Follistatin >6235 pg\/ml, Activin-A >591 pg\/ml, Activin-B >249 pg\/ml, CRP >10.3 mg\/dL, LDH >427 U\/L, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, Neutrophil\/Lymphocyte-Ratio >5.6, Years of Age >61, Comorbidities >1 and D-dimers >1097 ng\/ml, efficiently predicted and monitored fatal outcome independently of multiplicity and timing of sampling (AUC: 0.951{+\/-}0.032, p<10-6). Validation in 35 samples derived from a third hospital indicated comparable AUC (0.958{+\/-}0.086, p=0.032). Conclusion: This study unravels the link between Activin\/Folistatin-axis and COVID-19 mortality and introduces FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel pathophysiology-based tool that copes with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of COCVID-19, predicts disease outcome and supports clinical decision making. Prospective large-scale validation of this calculator, as well as investigation of the mechanisms linking Activin\/Folistatin-axis to COVID-19 pathogenesis is warranted.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evgenia Synolaki","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vasileios Papadopoulos","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Georgios Divolis","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Efstratios Gavriilidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Georgia Loli","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Arriana Gavriil","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace,  Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Olga Tsachouridou","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Eleni Sertaridou","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Petros Rafailidis","author_inst":"Second Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Arja Pasternack","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Boumpas","author_inst":"4th Department of Medicine, \"Attikon\" University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Olli Ritvos","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Symeon Metalidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Sideras","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.05.20188912","rel_title":"Beneficial and Harmful Outcomes of Tocilizumab in Severe COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.05.20188912","rel_abs":"Objectives: Pending for randomized control trials, the use of tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect on clinical outcomes of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19. Methods: From 1 January to 21 August 2020, we searched PubMed (via MEDLINE), Scopus, and medRxiv repository databases for observational studies in any language reporting efficacy and safety of TCZ use in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Independent and dually data extraction and quality assessment were performed. Results: Of 57 eligible studies, 27 controlled and 30 not. The overall included patients were 8,128: 4,021 treated with TCZ, in addition to standard of care (SOC), and 4,107 only receiving SOC. The pooled mortality was lower in the TCZ-group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.73 (95%CI 0.57-0.93; p=0.010). TCZ-treated patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a higher proportion, but ICU mortality was lower than in the control group. Conversely, a higher proportion of TCZ-treated patients developed secondary infections after TCZ use. Conclusions: TCZ seems beneficial in preventing in-hospital mortality in severe, non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, patients receiving TCZ appear to be at higher risk for secondary infections, especially those admitted to ICU.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Bellvitge University Hospital, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute-IDIBELL, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose M.

This study aimed to examine the characteristic of repositive COVID-19 cases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase and gray literature up to August 17, 2020. A random-effects model was applied to obtain the pooled prevalence of RNA repositive among recovered patients and the prevalence of subjects underlying comorbidity among recurrence cases. The other characteristics were calculated based on the summary data of individual studies. Results: A total of 37 studies were included in the final analysis, we have described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence cases. Of 2,436 patients recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged, an estimate of 16% (95% CI, 12% to 20%) patients was repositive with SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up. This proportion was 15% (95% CI, 11% to 18%) for China and 31% (95% CI, 26% to 37%) for Korea. Among recurrence cases, it was estimated 43% (95% CI, 31% to 55%) subjects underlying at least one comorbidity. The estimates for times from disease onset to admission, from admission to discharge, and from discharge to RNA positive conversion were 17.3, 16.7, and 10.5 days, respectively. Conclusions: This study summarized up-to-date evidence from case reports, case series, and observational studies for the characteristic of COVID-19 recurrence cases after discharge. It is recommended to pay attention to follow-up patients after discharge, even if they have been in quarantine.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tung Hoang","author_inst":"Duy Tan University"},{"author_name":"Jose M.

A large percentage of the patients are asymptomatic and hospitals around the world are struggling to restart routine services. We report the results of a universal testing protocol of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 in a large orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. Methods - A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 at a tertiary care orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab test before surgery. A questionnaire was used to assess the patient before the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test. Data regarding imaging, investigations and follow up was recorded. Results - In the month of July 2020, 168 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal RT -PCR swab test for COVID - 19 prior to planned orthopaedic surgical procedure (Both trauma and elective cases). 16 of the RT-PCR tests were positive. However vascular cases and absolute emergencies were done without a RT -PCR test with PPE and all universal precautions. 11 patients underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test. All 16 cases who were positive were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic positive rate was 9.52%. Of the 11 patients who underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test, only one patient had a positive test post - operatively. Conclusions - Routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing revealed a high rate of asymptomatic cases. If the RT-PCR test is positive, it is best to defer the case till the test returns negative. All precautions must be taken while performing emergency surgeries. Our algorithm in managing patients has proven to be effective and can be replicated with ease to continue operating and taking care of orthopaedic patients during this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kannan Karuppiah Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Chandy","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"M N Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Muniramaiah Ravishankar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishan Prasad","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan Rai","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan A","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Girish Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Noel nalin kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Sideras","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"orthopedics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.06.20189258","rel_title":"Superspreaders and High Variance Infectious Diseases","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.06.20189258","rel_abs":"A well-known characteristic of pandemics such as COVID-19 is the high level of transmission heterogeneity in the infection spread: not all infected individuals spread the disease at the same rate and some individuals (superspreaders) are responsible for most of the infections.

Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-Covid-19 patients in many hospitals across UK. We use this mathematical model to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-Covid bays, in the context of various scenarios: changes in the number of contacts with infected patients and staff, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (Covid-only) hospital bays.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Moreno Martos","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Parcell","author_inst":"NHS Tayside"},{"author_name":"Raluca Eftimie","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Muniramaiah Ravishankar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishan Prasad","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan Rai","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan A","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Girish Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Noel nalin kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Sideras","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.05.20189142","rel_title":"Development and Validation of the Patient History COVID-19 (PH-Covid19) Scoring System: A Multivariable Prediction Model of Death in Mexican Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.05.20189142","rel_abs":"We sought to develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of death in Mexican patients with COVID-19, by using demographic and patient history predictors.

To validate the model, 592,160 patients studied between June 1 and July 23, 2020 were included. Patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. Demographic and patient history variables were analyzed through Multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate predictors to be included in the prognostic scoring system called PH-Covid19. 83,779 patients were included to develop the model; 100,000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, COPD, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, and CKD) were included in the PH-Covid19 scoring system (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95%CI:0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Mancilla-Galindo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia"},{"author_name":"Juan Mauricio Vera-Zertuche","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Slavador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Addi Rhode Navarro-Cruz","author_inst":"Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla"},{"author_name":"Orietta Segura-Badilla","author_inst":"Universidad del Bio-Bio"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Reyez-Velazquez","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Francisco Javier Tepepa-Lopez","author_inst":"Instituto Politecnico Nacional"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aguilar-Alonso","author_inst":"Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla"},{"author_name":"Jose de Jesus Vidal-Mayo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Ashuin Kammar-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Sideras","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.06.20189373","rel_title":"The impact of mobility restriction measures on the reproduction index of Covid-19 in the city of Queretaro, Mexico","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.06.20189373","rel_abs":"An observational study based on official data (CONACYT and Ministry of Health) was carried out in which the effective reproduction index R(e) and the reproduction index R0 are compared with the mobility presented by Google.

Highlights key events; such as the main government interventions and social factors that could affect the society behavior. A positive relationship is observed between Re, R0, and the levels of mobility presented by Google. This indicates that an increase in mobility is associated with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In February, a significant decrease in mobility is observed, which lasts until approximately May 1st. This period corresponds to an R0 and R(e) between 1.17 and 1.87. After May 1st, there is a sustained increase in mobility levels. And, as of May 16, the effective reproduction index R (e) and the reproduction index R0 begin to increase. This is expected as it reflects the delay between the infection and the diagnosis of COVID-19. The R0 and R (e) increase from 1.45 on May 16 to 3.59 on July 5. According to the baseline of normal mobility levels, an increase from -49.6% on May 1st, to -20.6% on July 5 was observed. Based on these data, we conclude that the relaxation of restrictive mobility measures should be reconsidered. Despite this, mobility restrictions must not be a unique mitigation strategy for controlling the Reproductive Index. A comprehensive approach is needed, which generates socio-behavioral changes that allow a further reduction in reproductive rates.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oscar San Roman Orozco","author_inst":"New York University, School of Global Public Health, Applied Global Public Health Initiative"},{"author_name":"Santiago Agraz Orozco","author_inst":"Universidad Anahuac Queretaro, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Isidro A Gutierrez Alvarez","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Radaios","author_inst":"New York University, School of Global Public Health, Applied Global Public Health Initiative"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Reyez-Velazquez","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Francisco Javier Tepepa-Lopez","author_inst":"Instituto Politecnico Nacional"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aguilar-Alonso","author_inst":"Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla"},{"author_name":"Jose de Jesus Vidal-Mayo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Ashuin Kammar-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Sideras","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.03.20187252","rel_title":"Convalescent plasma in the management of moderate COVID-19 in India: An open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial (PLACID Trial)","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.03.20187252","rel_abs":"Objectives: Convalescent plasma (CP) as a passive source of neutralizing antibodies and immunomodulators is a century-old therapeutic option used for the management of viral diseases. We investigated its effectiveness for the treatment of COVID-19. Design: Open-label, parallel-arm, phase II, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Thirty-nine public and private hospitals across India. Participants: Hospitalized, moderately ill confirmed COVID-19 patients (PaO2\/FiO2: 200-300 or respiratory rate > 24\/min and SpO2 [&le;] 93% on room air). Intervention: Participants were randomized to either control (best standard of care (BSC)) or intervention (CP + BSC) arm. Two doses of 200 mL CP was transfused 24 hours apart in the intervention arm. Main Outcome Measure: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2\/FiO2<100) or all-cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment. Results: Between 22 nd April to 14 th July 2020, 464 participants were enrolled; 235 and 229 in intervention and control arm, respectively. Composite primary outcome was achieved in 44 (18.7%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (17.9%) in the control arm [aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.77]. Mortality was documented in 34 (14.5%) and 31 (13.5%) participants in intervention and control arm, respectively [aOR) 1.06 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.83]. Interpretation: CP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe COVID-19. This trial has high generalizability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy in settings with limited laboratory capacity. A priori measurement of neutralizing antibody titres in donors and participants may further clarify the role of CP in management of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":264,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anup Agarwal","author_inst":"Clinical Trial & Health Systems Research Unit,  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Aparna Mukherjee","author_inst":"Clinical Trial & Health Systems Research Unit, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Gunjan Kumar","author_inst":"Clinical Trial & Health Systems Research Unit,  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pranab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Scientist B,  Translational Global Health Policy and Research Cell,  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Tarun Bhatnagar","author_inst":"ICMR School of Public Health,  Indian Council of Medical Research -National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Malhotra","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"B Latha","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine, Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"Sunita Bundas","author_inst":"Department of Immunohaematology and Transfusion Medicine, SMS Medical College and Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"},{"author_name":"Vivek Kumar","author_inst":"Dept. of Critical Care Medicine,  Sir H N Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Dosi","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine,  Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Janak Kumar Khambholja","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Smt NHL Municipal Medical College, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie de Souza","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  BYL Nair Charitable Hospital & TN Medical College, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Raja Rao Mesipogu","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Gandhi Medical College, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Srivastava","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Simmi Dube","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Kiran Chaudhary","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine,  Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Subash S","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine,  Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"S.

response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in severely affected COVID-19 patients, as reflected by activated B cells egressing into the blood, at the single cell level. Early on, before seroconversion in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, activated peripheral B cells displayed a type 1 interferon-induced gene expression signature. After seroconversion, activated B cells lost this signature, expressed IL-21- and TGF-{beta}-induced gene expression signatures, and mostly IgG1 and IgA1. In the sustained immune reaction of the COVID-19 patients, until day 59, activated peripheral B cells shifted to expression of IgA2, reflecting instruction by TGF-{beta}. Despite the continued generation of activated B cells, those cells were not found in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients, nor did the IgA2 bind to dominant antigens of SARS-CoV-2. In severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 thus triggers a chronic immune reaction distracted from itself and instructed by TGF-{beta}.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Ferreira-Gomes","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Andrey Kruglov","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Pawel Durek","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Frederik Heinrich","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association,"},{"author_name":"Caroline Tizian","author_inst":"Laboratory of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Infection Immunology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Gitta Anne Heinz","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association,"},{"author_name":"Anna Pascual-Reguant","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Weijie Du","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Ronja Mothes","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Chaofan Fan","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Stefan Frischbutter","author_inst":"Dermatological Allergology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Katharina Habenicht","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Budzinski","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Justus Ninnemann","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Peter K.

used to investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins on the function of human cells, laying out a deeper understanding of COVID--19 and providing ground for drug repurposing strategies. However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each system's state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arsham Ghavasieh","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Bontorin","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Oriol Artime","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Manlio De Domenico","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Caroline Tizian","author_inst":"Laboratory of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Infection Immunology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Gitta Anne Heinz","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association,"},{"author_name":"Anna Pascual-Reguant","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Weijie Du","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Ronja Mothes","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Chaofan Fan","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Stefan Frischbutter","author_inst":"Dermatological Allergology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Katharina Habenicht","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Budzinski","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Justus Ninnemann","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Peter K.
