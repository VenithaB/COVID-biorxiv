In India, more than 3 million confirmed cases have been reported although with relatively low death rate of 1.8%. In this study, we sequenced 47 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients of 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), the largest state of India using third-generation sequencing technique. The phylogenetic clustering revealed that no UP sample was aligned with the previously defined USA clade, where the mortality was high. We identified 56 distinct SNP variations in the genomes of UP resulting in a unique mutation rate of 1.19% per sequence, which is greater than the value 0.88% obtained for the rest of India. The relatively less death rate in UP indicates that the mutation in the virus is deleterious. Further investigation is required with larger sample size to determine the degree of virulence vis-a-vis SNP variation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priti Prasad","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"Kishan Sahu","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"Babita Singh","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"SK Barik","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"Mehar Hasan Asif","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir V Sawant","author_inst":"National Botanical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sumit K Bag","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.266775","rel_title":"The S1\/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modulates cell entry pathways and transmission","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.266775","rel_abs":"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is posing major public health challenges. One unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the insertion of multi-basic residues at the S1\/S2 subunit cleavage site, the function of which remains uncertain. We found that the virus with intact spike (Sfull) preferentially enters cells via fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas a clone (Sdel) with deletion disrupting the multi-basic S1\/S2 site instead utilizes a less efficient endosomal entry pathway. This idea was supported by the identification of a suite of endosomal entry factors specific to Sdel virus by a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. A panel of host factors regulating the surface expression of ACE2 was identified for both viruses. Using a hamster model, animal-to-animal transmission with the Sdel virus was almost completely abrogated, unlike with Sfull. These findings highlight the critical role of the S1\/S2 boundary of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in modulating virus entry and transmission.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunkai Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fei Feng","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gaowei Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yin Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuanfei Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wendong Han","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Ye","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongjun Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qiliang Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.265223","rel_title":"In Vitro Inactivation of Human Coronavirus by Titania Nanoparticle Coatings and UVC Radiation: Throwing Light on SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.265223","rel_abs":"The newly identified pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to an atypical pneumonia-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The involvement of each of these proteins and their interplays during the assembly process of this new virus are poorly-defined and are likely {beta}-coronavirus-type different. Therefore, we sought to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 behaves for its assembly by expression assays of S, in combination with E, M and\/or N. By combining biochemical and imaging assays, we showed that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S and hence its furin-mediated processing. Indeed, our imaging data revealed that S remains at ERGIC or Golgi compartments upon expression of E or M, like for SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. By studying a mutant of S, we showed that its cytoplasmic tail, and more specifically, its C-terminal retrieval motif, is required for the M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlighted that E and M induce a specific maturation of S N-glycosylation, which is observed on particles and lysates from infected cells independently of its mechanisms of intracellular retention. Finally, we showed that both M, E and N are required for optimal production of virus-like-proteins. Altogether, our results indicated that E and M proteins influence the properties of S proteins to promote assembly of viral particles. Our results therefore highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other {beta}-coronaviruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its viral particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins, though their involvement in the virion assembly remain unknown for this particular coronavirus. Here we showed that presence of E and M influence the localization and maturation of S protein, in term of cleavage and N-glycosylation maturation. Indeed, E protein is able to slow down the cell secretory pathway whereas M-induced retention of S requires the retrieval motif in S C-terminus.

Cost-effective, highly efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed. Here, we used camelid immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We discovered multiple elite Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral infection at sub-ng\/ml concentration, more potent than some of the best human neutralizing antibodies. We determined a crystal structure of such an elite neutralizing Nb in complex with RBD. Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed multiple distinct and non-overlapping epitopes and indicated an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. Structural characterization facilitated the bioengineering of novel multivalent Nb constructs into multi-epitope cocktails that achieved ultrahigh neutralization potency (IC50s as low as 0.058 ng\/ml) and may prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist lyophilization, and aerosolization. These promising agents are readily translated into efficient, cost-effective, and convenient therapeutics to help end this once-in-a-century health crisis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yufei Xiang","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Sham Nambulli","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Zhengyun Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Heng Liu","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Zhe Sang","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"W.

Although a preliminary understanding of the replication and transcription mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged, their regulation remains unclear.\n\nResultsBased on reanalysis of public data, we propose a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of replication and transcription in--but not limited to--SARS-CoV-2. The key step leading to new discoveries was the identification of the cleavage sites of nsp15--an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, encoded by CoVs. According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleaving transcription regulatory sequences in the body. The expression level of nsp15 determines the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs, which in turn change the expression level of nps15 to reach equilibrium between the replication and transcription of CoVs.\n\nConclusionsThe replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that influences the persistence of CoVs in hosts. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, and provide new clues for future studies. One important clue is that nsp15 may be an important and ideal target for the development of drugs (e.g. uridine derivatives) against CoVs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gao Shan","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Zhi","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Jin Xiufeng","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Wang Fang","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Yibo","author_inst":"Hebei Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zhou Hao","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Liu Chang","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Ruan Jishou","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Duan Guangyou","author_inst":"Qilu Normal University"},{"author_name":"Li Xin","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Drew M Titmarsh","author_inst":"Dynomics Inc"},{"author_name":"Mark J Smyth","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Christian R Engwerda","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kelli PA MacDonald","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bald","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David E James","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"James Edward Hudson","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.264465","rel_title":"Dynamics of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein drives dsRNA melting in a counterintuitive tweezer-like mechanism","rel_date":"2020-08-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.264465","rel_abs":"The N protein of betacoronaviruses is responsible for nucleocapsid assembly and other essential regulatory functions. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of {beta}2-{beta}3 and 2-{beta}5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.\n\nIMPORTANCECoronaviruses are among the largest positive-sense RNA viruses. They display a unique discontinous transcription mechanism, involving N protein as a major player. The N-NTD promote the dsRNA melting releasing the nascent sense negative strand via a poorly known mechanism of action. It specifically recognizes the body TRS conserved RNA motif located at the 5 end of each ORF. N protein has the ability to transfer the nascent RNA strand to the leader TRS. The mechanism is essential and one single mutation at the RNA binding site of the N-NTD impairs the viral replication. Here, we describe a counterintuitive mechanism of action of N-NTD based on molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic modelling of the experimental melting activity of N-NTD. This data impacts directly in the understanding of the way N protein acts in the cell and will guide future experiments.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Icaro Putinhon Caruso","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Karoline Sanches","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Da Poian","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Anderson Pinheiro","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Fabio C.

Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Ciclesonide inhibited formation of double membrane vesicles, which anchor the viral replication-transcription complex in cells. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n\nImportanceThe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. To identify the effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in cultured cells. The inhaled ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS, and COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shutoku Matsuyama","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Miyuki Kawase","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Naganori Nao","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kazuya Shirato","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Ujike","author_inst":"Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University"},{"author_name":"Wataru Kamitani","author_inst":"Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Shimojima","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shuetsu Fukushi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mart M Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Rijnders","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Casper Rokx","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Frank Grosveld","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Dubravka Drabek","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Corine GeurtsvanKessel","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Berend Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Thijs Kuiken","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Barry Rockx","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.264564","rel_title":"Flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa increases the expression of the SARS-CoV2 entry protease TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells","rel_date":"2020-08-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.264564","rel_abs":"The major challenge of the COVID-19 health crisis is to identify the factors of susceptibility to SARS-Cov2 in order to adapt the recommendations to the populations and to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 to the most vulnerable people especially those having chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) including cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic pulmonary respiratory diseases (COPD).

We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S.

Spike glycoprotein on surface is a key factor of viral transmission, and has appeared a lot of variants due to gene mutations, which may influence the viral antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. Here, we used bioinformatic tools to analyze B-cell epitopes of prototype S protein and its 9 common variants. 12 potential linear and 53 discontinuous epitopes of B-cells were predicted from the S protein prototype. Importantly, by comparing the epitope alterations between prototype and variants, we demonstrate that B-cell epitopes and antigenicity of 9 variants appear significantly different alterations. The dominant D614G variant impacts the potential epitope least, only with moderately elevated antigenicity, while the epitopes and antigenicity of some mutants(V483A, V367F, etc.) with small incidence in the population change greatly. These results suggest that the currently developed vaccines should be valid for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 infectors. This study provides a scientific basis for large-scale application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and for taking precautions against the probable appearance of antigen escape induced by genetic variation after vaccination.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has lasted for more than half a year and has not yet been contained. Until now there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 caused disease (COVID-19). Successful vaccine development seems to be the only hope. However, this novel coronavirus belongs to the RNA virus, there is a high mutation rate in the genome, and these mutations often locate on the Spike proteins of virus, the gripper of the virus entering the cells. Vaccination induce the generation of antibodies, which block Spike protein. However, the Spike protein variants may change the recognition and binding of antibodies and make the vaccine ineffective. In this study, we predict neutralizing antibody recognition sites (B cell epitopes) of the prototype S protein of SARS-COV2, along with several common variants using bioinformatics tools. We discovered the variability in antigenicity among the mutants, for instance, in the more widespread D614G variant the change of epitope was least affected, only with slight increase of antigenicity. However, the antigenic epitopes of some mutants change greatly. These results could be of potential importance for future vaccine design and application against SARS-CoV2 variants.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xianlin Yuan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Liangping Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Krisitn Podack","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Matthew M Seavey","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Padmini Jayaraman","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Rahul Jasuja","author_inst":"Heat Biologics"},{"author_name":"Natasa Strbo","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Shuetsu Fukushi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mart M Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Rijnders","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Casper Rokx","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Frank Grosveld","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Dubravka Drabek","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Corine GeurtsvanKessel","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Berend Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Thijs Kuiken","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Barry Rockx","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.21.20179317","rel_title":"Health Disparities and COVID-19: A Retrospective Study Examining Individual and Community Factors Causing Disproportionate COVID-19 Outcomes in Cook County, Illinois, March 16-May 31, 2020","rel_date":"2020-08-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.21.20179317","rel_abs":"Background: Early data from the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that the disease has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color causing higher infection and mortality rates within those communities.

This information is critical for policy makers and practitioners to ensure the safety of staff, students and the wider community during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Public Health England initiated enhanced national surveillance following the reopening of educational settings during the summer mini-term on 01 June 2020. COVID-19 related situations in educational settings across England were reviewed daily and followed-up until 31 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreak rates were calculated for staff and students attending early year settings, primary and secondary schools during June 2020. FINDINGS There were 67 single confirmed cases, 4 co-primary cases and 30 COVID-19 outbreaks during June 2020, with a strong correlation between number of outbreaks and regional COVID-19 incidence (0.51 outbreaks for each SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100,000 in the community; p=0.001). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon across all educational settings. Staff members had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to students in any educational setting, and the majority of cases linked to outbreaks were in staff. The probable transmission direction for the 30 confirmed outbreaks was: staff-to-staff (n=15), staff-to-student (n=7), student-to-staff (n=6) and student-to-student (n=2). INTERPRETATION SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the first month after the easing of national lockdown in England. The strong correlation with regional SARS-CoV-2 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. Additional interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff members.

This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients. Methods A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: 'COVID-19', 'PLR', 'severity', and 'mortality'. The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%). Conclusion High PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Martin Simadibrata","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Bashar Adi Wahyu Pandhita","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Muammar Emir Ananta","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Tamara Tango","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Robert CA Warmerdam","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Johanna C Herkert","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Floranne Boulogne","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Annique Claringbould","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands and Structural Computational Biology unit, EMB"},{"author_name":"Esteban A Lopera-Maya","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen,  Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Meike Bartels","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jouke-Jan Hottenga","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ganna","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Juha Karjalainen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;

Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15%) compared to white (5.5%; P<.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.7%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients. Conclusion: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall Covid-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, co-morbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathanael R Fillmore","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer La","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Raphael E Szalat","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David P Tuck","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vinh Nguyen","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Cenk Yildirim","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Nhan V Do","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary T Brophy","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nikhil C Munshi","author_inst":"VA Boston Healthcare System, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Meike Bartels","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jouke-Jan Hottenga","author_inst":"Department of Biological Psychology, FGB, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ganna","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Juha Karjalainen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;

In order to determine the variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the state of Nevada, 200 patient specimens from positively identified cases were sequenced through our robust protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs. This protocol enabled the identification of specific nucleotide variants including those coding for D614G and clades defining mutations. Additionally, these sequences were used for determining the phylogenetic relationships of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of public health importance occurring in the state of Nevada. Our study reports the occurrence of a novel variant in the nsp12 (RdRp-RNA dependent RNA Polymerase) protein at residue 323 (314aa of orf1b) to Phenylalanine (F) from Proline (P), present in the original isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1). This 323F variant is found at a very high frequency (46% of the tested specimen) in Northern Nevada, possibly because the virus accumulated this mutation while circulating in the community and the shelter in place orders restricted the introduction and spread of other variants into this region. Structural modeling of the RdRp with P323F variant did not show any significant difference in protein conformation, but the phenotypic effect is unknown and an area of active investigation. In conclusion, our results highlight the introduction and spread of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants at very high frequency within a distinct geographic location that is important for clinical and public health perspectives in understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Hartley","author_inst":"Nevada Genomics Center, University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Richard L Tillett","author_inst":"Nevada Institute of Personalized Medicine, University of Nevada, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Yanji Xu","author_inst":"Nevada Center for Bioinformatics, University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"David P AuCoin","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joel R Sevinsky","author_inst":"Theiagen Consulting, LLC"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gorzalski","author_inst":"Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Mark C Pandori","author_inst":"Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, Pathology & Lab Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erin Buttery","author_inst":"Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory of the Southern Nevada Health District, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Holly Hansen","author_inst":"Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory of the Southern Nevada Health District, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Michael Picker","author_inst":"Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory of the Southern Nevada Health District, Las Vegas"},{"author_name":"Cyprian C Rossetto","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology & Immunology,  University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Subhash C Verma","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juha Karjalainen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland;

We explore the compatibility between multiple DNA polymerases with high strand-displacement activity and thermostable reverse transcriptases required for RT-LAMP. We optimize reaction conditions and demonstrate their applicability using both synthetic RNA and clinical patient samples. Finally, we validated the optimized RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw nasopharyngeal samples from 184 patients.

Here, we report that for COVID-19 this does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 COVID-19 patients hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN production is both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they become critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 are produced before IFNs, in all patients, and persist for a prolonged time. By comparison, in 16 flu patients hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to COVID-19 and 24 milder non-hospitalized flu patients IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN are robustly induced, earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, while pro-inflammatory cytokines are only acutely and transiently produced. Notably, higher IFN-{lambda} levels in COVID-19 patients correlate with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance, and a higher IFN-{lambda}:type I IFN ratio with improved outcome of critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in COVID-19 patients correlate with longer hospitalization time and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19 contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioanna Evdokia Galani","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikoletta Rovina","author_inst":"ICU, 1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens,"},{"author_name":"Vicky Lampropoulou","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Triantafyllia","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Maria Manioudaki","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Pavlos","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Koukaki","author_inst":"1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens, Gree"},{"author_name":"Paraskevi C Fragkou","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Panou","author_inst":"1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens, Gree"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Rapti","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ourania Koltsida","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Andreas Mentis","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Koulouris","author_inst":"1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens, Gree"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Antonia Koutsoukou","author_inst":"ICU, 1st Department of Respiratory Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Sotiria General Hospital of Chest Diseases, Athens,"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Andreakos","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xiushan Yin","author_inst":"Applied Biology Laboratory, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, 110142, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Vicent Pelechano","author_inst":"SciLifeLab, Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology.

As governments begin to relax restrictions on public life there is a need to understand the potential impact that reopening schools may have on transmission. Methods We used data provided by the UK Department for Education to construct a network of English schools, connected through pairs of pupils resident at the same address. We used the network to evaluate the potential for transmission between schools, and for long range propagation across the network, under different reopening scenarios. Results Amongst the options evaluated we found that reopening only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 (4-6 and 10-11 year olds) resulted in the lowest risk of transmission between schools, with outbreaks within a single school unlikely to result in outbreaks in adjacent schools in the network. The additional reopening of Years 10 and 12 (14-15 and 16-17 year olds) resulted in an increase in the risk of transmission between schools comparable to reopening all primary school years (4-11 year olds). However, the majority of schools presented low risk of initiating widespread transmission through the school system. Reopening all secondary school years (11-18 year olds) resulted in large potential outbreak clusters putting up to 50% of households connected to schools at risk of infection if sustained transmission within schools was possible. Conclusions Reopening secondary school years is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England. Keeping transmission within schools limited is essential for reducing the risk of large outbreaks amongst school-aged children and their household members.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James D Munday","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katharine Sherratt","author_inst":"London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sophie Meakin","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School Of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A.

No antiviral treatment options are currently available with proven clinical efficacy. However, preliminary findings from phase III trials suggest that remdesivir is an effective and safe treatment option for COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Objective: The aim of the present meta-analysis is to investigate whether remdesivir is effective for treating COVID-19 including reduced in-hospital adverse events, oxygen support, and mortality rates. Methods: Using PRISMA reporting guidelines, a review was conducted from January 1 2020 until 6 August 2020 with MeSH terms including COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID, remdesivir, adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analog, Veklury using Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. A modified Delphi process was used to include the studies and ensure that the objectives were addressed (Appendix A). Using dichotomous data for select values, the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated applying Mantel Haenszel (M-H) random-effects method in Review Manager 5.4. Results: Randomized controlled trials pooled in 2,429 participants with 41.6% (n=1011) in the remdesivir group and 58.4% (n=1,418) in the placebo group. The placebo group had a higher risk of mortality as compared to the intervention group with significant odds ratio (OR=0.61) (95% confidence interval of 0.45-0.83; P=0.001). There was moderate heterogeneity among the studies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that remdesivir extends clinical benefits by reducing mortality, adverse events and oxygen support in moderate to severely ill COVID-19 patients. Concerted efforts and further randomized placebo-controlled trials are warranted to examine the potency of anti-viral drugs and immune-pathological host responses contributing to severity of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Azza Sarfraz","author_inst":"Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakisan."},{"author_name":"Zouina Sarfraz","author_inst":"Fatima Jinnah Medical University, Lahore, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Marcos Sanchez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Jack Michel","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"George Michel","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Odalys Frontela","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Jorge Posada","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Jose Cardona","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

METHODS An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in five-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds Ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and post-menopausal (>50 years). RESULTS The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in women than men (about +15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about +50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are also linked to age. Pre-adolescent girls had the same risk of infection and fatality rate as boys. Adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same five-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17{beta}-estradiol has a positive effect on expression of the human ACE2 protein--which plays an essential role for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry--propensity score matching was performed for the women's sub-cohort, comparing users versus non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women >50 yrs receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95 % CI [0.18, 0.62] and the Hazard Ratio was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 yrs), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels. CONCLUSIONS As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ute Seeland","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Flaminia Coluzzi","author_inst":"Department Medical and Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Department Neurosciences, Mental Health and Sensory Organs, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Cameron Mura","author_inst":"School of Data Science and Dept of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Philip E Bourne","author_inst":"School of Data Science and Dept of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Max Heiland","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Robert Preissner","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

Currently, contacts traced manually through the NHS Test and Trace scheme in the UK are asked to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they were exposed to the index case, which represents the upper bound for the incubation period. However, following previous work on screening strategies for air travellers it may be possible that this quarantine period could be reduced if combined with PCR testing. Adapting the simulation model for contact tracing, we find that quarantine periods of at least 10 days combined with a PCR test on day 9 may largely emulate the results from a 14-day quarantine period in terms of the averted transmission potential from secondary cases (72% (95%UI: 3%, 100%) vs 75% (4%, 100%), respectively). These results assume the delays from testing index cases' and tracing their contacts are minimised (no longer than 4.5 days on average). If secondary cases are traced and quarantined 1 day earlier on average, shorter quarantine periods of 8 days with a test on day 7 (76% (7%, 100%)) approach parity with the 14 day quarantine period with a 1 day longer delay to the index cases' test. However, the risk of false-negative PCR tests early in a traced case's infectious period likely prevents the use of testing to reduce quarantine periods further than this, and testing immediately upon tracing, with release if negative, will avert just 17% of transmission potential on average. In conclusion, the use of PCR testing is an effective strategy for reducing quarantine periods for secondary cases, while still reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially if delays in the test and trace system can be reduced, and may improve quarantine compliance rates.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Billy J Quilty","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Samuel Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Preissner","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

Insufficient testing for COVID19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case\/fatality proportion. Given the age and sex distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID19, the underlying sex and age distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for monitoring trends of COVID19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR). Methods Age and sex mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age and sex specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated for selected European countries from 17\/03\/2020 to 22\/06\/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex and age adjusted mortality for COVID19 per million population in each country. Results The cumulative mortality from COVID19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On 22\/06\/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22\/06\/2020; however Ireland (which had a CMR in line with the total European population) emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of COVID19 mortality with an AMTR of 550\/million on 22\/06\/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy. Conclusions In understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID19, comparable international data is a priority. Our methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the comparative mortality from COVID19 pandemic worldwide.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valentina Gallo","author_inst":"University of Gronongen"},{"author_name":"Paolo Chiodini","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli"},{"author_name":"Dario Bruzzese","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Elias Kondilis","author_inst":"Aristotheles University of Thessaloniki"},{"author_name":"Daniel Howdon","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Jochen Mierau","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhopal","author_inst":"University of Ediburgh"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.

The COVID-19 preventive behaviours were explored and compared based on the social-demographic and personal attributes of individuals. Using a publicly available and recently collected dataset on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and exploiting both Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and regression analysis, the study notes that socio-demographic and personal attributes of individuals indeed shape the subjective prevention actions and thereby the control of the spread of a pandemic. Three socio-demographic attributes (sex, marital family status and having children) appear to have played an influential role in abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours by Japanese citizens, especially with women having children being noted more conscious than the male counterparts. Work status also appears to have some impact especially concerning social distancing and personal protection behaviour. Among the personality attributes, smoking behaviour appeared as a contributing factor with non-smokers or less-frequent smokers more compliant to the protection behaviours. Overall, the findings imply the need of public policy campaigning to account for variations in protection behaviour due to socio-demographic and personal attributes during a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shahadat Uddin","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tasadduq Imam","author_inst":"CQUniversity (Melbourne)"},{"author_name":"Matloob Khushi","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Arif Khan","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Moni","author_inst":"University of New south Wales"},{"author_name":"Jochen Mierau","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhopal","author_inst":"University of Ediburgh"},{"author_name":"Saskia Preissner","author_inst":"Department Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Angueira","author_inst":"Larkin Health System, South Miami, Florida, USA."},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Pieter LA Fraaij","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Marion P.G.
