Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19 compared to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Methods: We evaluated the sensitivity using a panel of finger prick blood samples from participants >18 years of age that had been tested for COVID-19 by qRT-PCR. For assessing specificity, we used serum samples from the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort participants collected in 2012 with no exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Results: The sensitivity of the test was 77.1% (95% CI 66.6 - 85.6), based upon 83 subjects who had tested positive for qRT-PCR at least 10 days before the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Based upon 100 sera samples, specificity was 98.0% (95% CI 92.9 - 99.8). There was substantial agreement (Kappa score 0.76) between the qRT-PCR results and the RDT. Interpretation. The validation results are well in line with previous assessments of the test, and confirm that it is sufficiently precise for epidemiological studies aimed at monitoring levels and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia C Pellanda","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Eliana M Wendland","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Alan JA McBride","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Luciana Tovo-Rodrigues","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Marcos RA Ferreira","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093666","rel_title":"TAMING COVID-19 EPIDEMIC IN SAO PAULO WITH ALOGISTIC MODEL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL MEASURES","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093666","rel_abs":"In this paper I use the simple logistic mathematical model to represent the development of COVID-19 epidemic in Sao Paulo city under quarantine regime and I estimate the total amount of time it is necessary to decrease the number of seriously ill patients in order to reduce the demand for hospital beds of Intensive Care Units (ICU) to tolerable levels.

Design: 2 by 3 experimental design. Setting: Online with data collected between 28th April and 1st May 2020. Participants: 1,204 adults registered with a UK research panel. Intervention: Participants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms used to describe the type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants perceiving no risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody positive test result. Other outcomes include intended changes to frequency of hand washing and physical distancing. Results: When using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants [95% CI: 16.1 to 22.5] (vs 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4]) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus at some point in the future given an antibody-positive test result (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]). Using the terms Passport or Certificate, as opposed to Test, had no significant effect (AOR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62 to 2.48] and AOR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.47 to 1.99] respectively). There was no significant interaction between the effects of the test and result terminology. Across groups, perceiving no risk of infection was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently (AOR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.25 to 4.28]) but there was no significant association with intended avoidance of physical contact with others outside of the home (AOR: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.93 to 2.03]). Conclusions: Using the term Immunity (vs Antibody) to describe antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 increases the proportion of people believing that an antibody-positive result means they have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future, a perception that may be associated with less frequent hand washing. The way antibody testing is described may have implications for the likely impact of testing on transmission rates.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jo Waller","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Henry W W Potts","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Abigail Mottershaw","author_inst":"Behavioural Insights Team, London"},{"author_name":"Theresa M Marteau","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093344","rel_title":"Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093344","rel_abs":"This paper seeks to determine which workers affected by lockdown measures can return to work when a government decides to apply lockdown exit strategies.

COVID19 driven pandemic causes panic, fear and stress among all strata of society. Like all other medical professions, dentists, particularly endodontists, who are highly exposed to aerosols would be exposed to stress. The aim of this study was to assess the (dis)stress among Indian endodontists and the factors that could influence the (dis)stress. Methods: From 8th April to 16th April 2020, we conducted an online survey in closed endodontic social media using snowball sampling technique, collecting basic demographic data, practice setting and relevant data. Psychological stress and perceived distress were collected through COVID-19 Peri-traumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and Perceived stress scale (PSS). Multinomial regression analysis was performed to estimate relative risk rate and P[&le;]0.05 was considered significant. Results: This study had 586 Indian endodontists completing this survey across India. Of these, 311(53.07%) were males, 325(55%) in the age group of 25-35 years, 64%in urban areas, 13.14% in solo-practice and a fourth of them were residents. Female endodontists had high perceived stress (RRR=2.46,P=0.01) as compared to males, as measured by PSS. Younger endodontists<25 years(RRR=9.75;P=0.002) and 25-35years (RRR=4.60;P=0.004) as compared with >45 years age-group had more distress. Exclusive consultants had RRR= 2.90, P=0.02, for mild-to-moderate distress as compared to normal. Factors driving this phenomenon are considered. Conclusions: During the lock down due to COVID-19, 1-in-2 Indian endodontists had distress, as measured by CPDI and 4-in-5 of them had perceived stress, as indicated by PSS. Our model identified certain factors driving the (dis)stress, which would help policy framers to initiate appropriate response.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anil Kumar Ramachandran Nair","author_inst":"Ragas Dental College & Hospital, (Affiliated to The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University), Chennai"},{"author_name":"Karumaran Savarimalai Chellaswamy","author_inst":"Ragas Dental College & Hospital (Affiliated to The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University), Chennai"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Kattula","author_inst":"Ragas Dental College and Hospital (Affiliated to The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University), Chennai"},{"author_name":"Rooban Thavarajah","author_inst":"Marundeeshwara Oral Pathology Services and Analytics, Chennai"},{"author_name":"Anusa Arunachalam Mohandoss","author_inst":"Shri Satya Sai Medical College and Research institute (Affiliated to Shri  Balaji Vidyapeeth)"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"dentistry and oral medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093039","rel_title":"Mobility Reduction and Covid-19 Transmission Rates","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093039","rel_abs":"Assessing the contribution of mobility declines to the control of Covid-19 diffusion is an urgent challenge of global import.

Reduced form regression estimates that flexibly control for time trends suggest that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility is associated with a 0.04-0.07 reduction in the value of the effective reproduction number, R(t) , depending on geographical region and modelling choice. According to these estimates, to avoid the critical value of R = 1, easing mobility restrictions may have to be limited or delayed until other non-mobility related preventative measures reduce R to a level of approximately 0.7 in Europe, 0.75 in Asia, and 0.8 in the United States.

Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 {micro}M) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM. Our data supports a model in which the RBD of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 confers sequence specificity for HS expressed by target cells whereas an additional HS binding site in the S1\/S2 proteolytic cleavage site enhances the avidity of binding. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Liu","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Chopra","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Xiuru Li","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Margreet A Wolfert","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Mark Tompkins","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan Boons","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Maria Mattioli","author_inst":"University Hospital of Parma"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.085613","rel_title":"Potential modes of COVID-19 transmission from human eye revealed by single-cell atlas","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.085613","rel_abs":"There is a pressing urgency to understand the entry route of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into the human body.

Here, we profiled the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and receptor-associated enzymes at single-cell resolution of thirty-three human ocular cell types. We identified unique populations of corneal cells with high ACE2 expression, among which the conjunctival cells co-expressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggesting that they could serve as the entry points for the virus.

The disease is notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2, producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol. Molecules that reduce cholesterol or disrupt ACE2 localization with viral entry points or furin localization in the producer cells, may reduce the severity of COVID19 in obese patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hao Wang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zixuan Yuan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mahmud Arif Pavel","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert Hobson","author_inst":"Bruker"},{"author_name":"Scott Hansen","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hu Li","author_inst":"Center for Individualized Medicine, Department of Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA"},{"author_name":"Yuin Han Loh","author_inst":"Epigenetics and Cell Fates Laboratory, Programme in Stem Cell, Regenerative Medicine and Aging, A*STAR Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore 138673"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.086223","rel_title":"Multiple introductions, regional spread and local differentiation during the first week of COVID-19 epidemic in Montevideo, Uruguay","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.086223","rel_abs":"BackgroundAfter its emergence in China in December 2019, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread infecting more than 3 million people worldwide.

Interaction between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor on the cells is a potential factor in the infectivity of a host. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain with its receptor - ACE2, in different hosts was evaluated to understand and predict viral entry. The protein and nucleotide sequences of ACE2 were initially compared across different species to identify key differences among them. The ACE2 receptor of various species was homology modeled (6LZG as a reference) and its binding ability to the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. Initially, the spike binding properties of ACE2 of known infected and uninfected species was compared with each Order (of animals) as a group. Finally, a logistic regression model vis-a-vis the spike binding properties of ACE2 (Interaction energy, entropy sidechain and entropy mainchain) was constructed to predict the probability of viral entry in different hosts.\n\nResultsPhylogeny and alignment comparison did not lead to any meaningful conclusion on viral entry in different hosts. Out of several spike binding properties of ACE2, a significant difference between the known infected and uninfected species was observed for five spike binding properties of ACE2. However, these parameters did not specifically categorize the animals into infected or uninfected, for all the Orders (of animals). The logistic regression model constructed revealed that in the mammalian class, most of the species of Carnivores, Artiodactyls, Perissodactyls, Pholidota, and Primates had high probability of viral entry. However, among the primates, baboons have very low probability of viral entry. Among rodents, hamsters were highly probable for viral entry with rats and mice having a very low probability. Rabbits have a medium probability of viral entry. In Birds, ducks have a very low probability, while chickens seemed to have medium probability and turkey showed the highest probability of viral entry.\n\nConclusionsMost of the species considered in this study showed high probability of viral entry. This study would prompt us to closely follow certain species of animals for determining pathogenic insult by SARS-CoV-2 and for determining their ability to act as a carrier and\/or disseminator.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manas Ranjan Praharaj","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Garg","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Raja Ishaq Nabi Khan","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Sharma","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Manjit Panigrahi","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"B P Mishra","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Bina Mishra","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"G Sai Kumar","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Kumar Gandham","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Raj Kumar Singh","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Subeer Majumdar","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Trilochan Mohapatra","author_inst":"Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.085506","rel_title":"Clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests and potential protective immunity","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.085506","rel_abs":"As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, serological assays are urgently needed for rapid diagnosis, contact tracing and for epidemiological studies.

Focusing on IgG antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG & Vircell COVID-19 ELISA IgG) in comparison to one lateral flow assay ((LFA) FaStep COVID-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test Device) and two in-house developed assays (immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)). We tested follow up serum\/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient hospital stay.\n\nFor all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5-9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10-18) after PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. With exception of one sample, all positive tested samples in the analysed cohort, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in-house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing (protective) properties in the PRNT, indicating a potential protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding specificity, there was evidence that samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross-reacted in the ELISA assays and IFA, in one case generating a false positive result (may giving a false sense of security).

Methods: Single-center cohort performed from March 3, 2020, to April 14, 2020 in 4 intensive care units in Bordeaux University Hospital, France. All patients with COVID19 and pulmonary severity criteria were included. AKI was defined using KDIGO criteria. A systematic urinary analysis was performed. The incidence, severity, clinical presentation, biological characterisation (transient vs. persistent acute kidney injury; proteinuria, hematuria and glycosuria), and short-term outcomes was evaluated. Results: 71 patients were included, with basal serum creatinine of 69 +\/- 21 micromol\/L. At admission, AKI was present in 8\/71 (11%) patients. Median follow-up was 17 [12-23] days. AKI developed in a total of 57\/71 (80%) patients with 35% Stage 1, 35% Stage 2, and 30% Stage 3 acute kidney injury; 10\/57 (18%) required renal replacement therapy.

An overlooked angle is the potential psychosocial impact on PCPs as they place themselves at increased risk of infection. This study examines PCPs' concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS 216 PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were convenience sampled from three primary care organizations in Singapore. Participants completed an online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection, and a source of risk and concern to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks and the need to care for COVID-19 patients. Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high. PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors. CONCLUSIONS Primary care will continue to be crucial in outbreak management efforts. Healthcare organizations should continue to support PCPs by managing their psychosocial and professional needs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jerrald Lau","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"David Hsien-Yung Tan","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Gretel Jianlin Wong","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yii-Jen Lew","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Ying-Xian Chua","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Lian-Leng Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital, Family and Continuing Care"},{"author_name":"Han-Kwee Ho","author_inst":"National University Health System, Regional Health System Office"},{"author_name":"Thiam-Soo Kwek","author_inst":"National University Health System, Primary Care Network"},{"author_name":"Sue-Anne Ee-Shiow Toh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ker-Kan Tan","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antoine Dewitte","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Olivier Joannes-boyau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Catherine Fleureau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Roze","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Cedric Carrie","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Laurent Petit","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Clouzeau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Charline Sazio","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hoang-Nam Bui","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Odile Pillet","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Claire Rigothier","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Frederic Vargas","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Christian Combe","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Didier Gruson","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boyer","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093005","rel_title":"Willingness to seek laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 with home, drive-through, and clinic-based specimen collection locations","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093005","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus testing for persons with COVID-19 symptoms, and contact tracing for those testing positive, will be critical to successful epidemic control. Willingness of persons experiencing symptoms to seek testing may determine the success of this strategy. Methods: A cross-sectional, online survey in the United States measured willingness to seek testing if feeling ill under different specimen collection scenarios: home-based saliva, home-based swab, drive-through facility swab, and clinic-based swab. Instructions clarified that home-collected specimens would be mailed to a laboratory for testing. We presented similar willingness questions regarding testing during follow-up care. Results: Of 1435 participants, comprising a broad range of sociodemographic groups, 92% were willing to test with a home saliva specimen, 88% with home swab, 71% with drive-through swab, and 60% with clinic collected swab. Moreover, 68% indicated they would be more likely to get tested if there was a home testing option. There were no significant differences in willingness items across sociodemographic variables or for those currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Results were nearly identical for willingness to receive testing for follow-up COVID-19 care. Conclusions: We observed a hierarchy of willingness to test for SARS-CoV-2, ordered by the degree of contact required. Home specimen collection options could result in up to one-third more symptomatic persons seeking testing, facilitating contact tracing and optimal clinical care. Remote specimen collection options may ease supply chain challenges and decrease the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. As home specimen collection options receive regulatory approval, they should be scaled rapidly by health systems.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aaron J Siegler","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eric Hall","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Luisi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Maria Zlotorzynska","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Wilde","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Travis Sanchez","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Heather Bradley","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sue-Anne Ee-Shiow Toh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ker-Kan Tan","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antoine Dewitte","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Olivier Joannes-boyau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Catherine Fleureau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Roze","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Cedric Carrie","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Laurent Petit","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Clouzeau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Charline Sazio","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hoang-Nam Bui","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Odile Pillet","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Claire Rigothier","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Frederic Vargas","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Christian Combe","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Didier Gruson","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boyer","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093534","rel_title":"Rapidly Measuring Spatial Accessibility of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources: A Case Study of Illinois, USA","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093534","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.

This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19.

The driving factors in the recurrence prediction model included: age, BMI; lowest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for cholinesterase, fibrinogen, albumin, prealbumin, calcium, eGFR, creatinine; highest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase; the first test results during hospitalization for partial pressure of oxygen, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, blood procalcitonin; and the first test episodic Ct value and the lowest Ct value of the nasopharyngeal swab RT PCR results. Area under the ROC curve is 0.786. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This case series provides clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with recurrent PCR positivity, despite strict quarantine, at a 16.7% rate. Use of a recurrence prediction algorithm may identify patients at high risk of PCR retest positivity of SARS-CoV-2 and help modify COVID-19 case management and health policy approaches.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Huang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Le

and people with underlying comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and death following hospitalisation with COVID-19. As comorbidity increases with age, it is necessary to understand the age-adjusted relationship between comorbidity and COVID-19 outcomes, in order to enhance planning capabilities and our understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid, comprehensive review of the literature up to 10 April 2020, to assess the international empirical evidence on the association between comorbidities and severe or critical care outcomes of COVID-19, after accounting for age, among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Results: After screening 579 studies, we identified seven studies eligible for inclusion and these were synthesised narratively. All were from China. The emerging evidence base mostly indicates that after adjustment for age (and in some cases other potential confounders), obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), and cancer are all associated with worse outcomes. The largest study, using a large nationwide sample of COVID-19 patients in China, found that those with multiple comorbidities had more than twice the risk of a severe outcome or death compared with patients with no comorbidities, after adjusting for age and smoking (HR=2.59, 95% CI 1.61, 4.17). Conclusions: This review summarises for clinicians, policymakers, and academics the most robust evidence to date on this topic, to inform the management of patients and control measures for tackling the pandemic. Given the intersection of comorbidity with ethnicity and social disadvantage, these findings also have important implications for health inequalities. As the pandemic develops, further research should confirm these trends in other settings outside China and explore mechanisms by which various underlying health conditions increase risk of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate E Mason","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Philip McHale","author_inst":"University of

Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis using inverse variance random effect models including all studies that evaluate the role of ACEIs\/ARBs and reported adjusted odds ratio. Results: Nine studies met our eligibility criteria that enrolled a population of 58615 patients infected with SASR-CoV-2. Prior use of ACEIs\/ARBs were associated with significant reduction of inpatient mortality among infected patients with SASR-CoV-2, adjusted odds ratio from 4 studies 0.33, 95% confidence interval ( 0.22,0.49) with zero in between studies heterogeneity and with significant reduction of critical or fatal outcome , pooled adjusted odds ratio from 5 studies 0.32,95% confidence interval ( 0.22,0.46) with no in between studies heterogeneity. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that prior use ACEIs \/ARBs is associated with a decreased risk of death or critical outcome among SASR-CoV-2 infected patients.This findings is limited by the observational nature of included studies.However, it provides a reassurance to the public not to stop prescribed ACEIs \/ARBs due to fear of severe COVID-19. It also calls upon investigators and ethics committee to reconsider the ongoing randomized trials of discontinuation of these drugs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aref A.

While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8\/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n=172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 +\/- 7031 ng\/ml, n=32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 +\/- 3146, p<0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hui Shi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

Viral detection using RT-qPCR has been among the most important factors helping to control local spread of SARS-CoV-2 and it is considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis. Nevertheless, the RNA extraction step is both laborious and expensive, thus hampering the diagnosis in many places where there are not laboratory staff of funds enough to contribute for diagnosis efforts. Thus, the need to simplify procedures, reduce costs of the techniques used, and expand the capacity of the number of diagnostics of COVID-19 is imperative. In this study, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of RNA extraction has been successfully achieved through pre-treatment of the clinical sample with Proteinase K. The results show that only the use of proteinase K, without the need to perform the whole standard protocol for sample extraction and purification, can be an efficient technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19, since 91% of the samples matched the results with the standard procedure, with an average increase of 5.64 CT in the RT-qPCR.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Larissa Mallmann","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Karoline Schallenberger","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Meriane Demoliner","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Ana Karolina Antunes Eisen","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Bruna Saraiva Hermann","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Fagner Henrique Heldt","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Alana Witt Hansen","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Fernando R Spilki","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Juliane Deise Fleck","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Njira L.

SCARFs include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Among adult organs, enterocytes and goblet cells of the small intestine and colon, kidney proximal tubule cells, and gallbladder basal cells appear most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also suggests alternate entry paths for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung, central nervous system, and heart. We predict spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells, but not ovarian cells, to be highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Early stages of embryonic and placental development show a moderate risk of infection. The nasal epithelium looks like another battleground, characterized by high expression of both promoting and restricting factors and a potential age-dependent shift in SCARF expression. Lastly, SCARF expression appears broadly conserved across human, chimpanzee and macaque organs examined.

This systematic review included all clinical trials on pharmacological therapy related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) up to April 22, 2020. Clinical trials characteristics (country, design, sample size, main outcomes, expected completion data, type of participants, length of the interventions, main outcomes). How many trials and the accumulated sample size by drug or combination of drugs, and by month in 2020 was depicted. We identified 412 clinical trials registers addressing the effect of pharmacological treatments on COVID-19, predominantly from Asia and Europe (42.2% and 31.1% of clinical trials registers, respectively). The most main outcomes studied were clinical recovery (54.4% of the clinical trials registers, respiratory recovery (28.2%) mortality (27.4%), viral load\/negativity (20.4%). During 2020, a huge amount of clinical trials are expected to be completed: 41 trials (60,366 participants) using hydroxychloroquine, 20 trials (1,588 participants) using plasma, 18 trials (6,830 participants) using chloroquine, 12 trials (9,938 participants using lopinavir\/ritonavir, 11 trials (1,250 participants) using favipiravir, 10 trials ( 2,175 participants) using tocilizumab and 6 trials (13,540 participants) using Remdesivir. The distribution of the number of registered clinical trials among the different therapeutic options leads to an excess of sample size for some and a lack for others. Our data allow us to conclude that by the end of June we will have results of almost 20 trials involving 40000 patients for hydroxychloroquine and 5 trials with 4500 patients for remdesivir; however, low statistical power is expected from the 9 clinical trials testing the efficacy of favipiravir or the 5 testing tocilizumab, since they will recruit less than 1000 patients each one.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vicente Martinez-Vizcaino","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Arthur E Mesas","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Ivan Cavero-Redondo","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Alicia Saz-Lara","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Irene Sequi-Dominguez","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Carlos Pascual-Morena","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Celia Alvarez-Bueno","author_inst":"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"},{"author_name":"Fernando R Spilki","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Juliane Deise Fleck","author_inst":"Universidade Feevale"},{"author_name":"Njira L.

As of 1st May 2020, the Italian health authorities reported 28,238 deaths nationally. To control the epidemic, the Italian government implemented a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school and university closures, social distancing and full lockdown involving banning of public gatherings and non essential movement. In this report, we model the effect of NPIs on transmission using data on average mobility. We estimate that the average reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) is currently below one for all Italian regions, and significantly so for the majority of the regions. Despite the large number of deaths, the proportion of population that has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (the attack rate) is far from the herd immunity threshold in all Italian regions, with the highest attack rate observed in Lombardy (13.18% [10.66%-16.70%]). Italy is set to relax the currently implemented NPIs from 4th May 2020. Given the control achieved by NPIs, we consider three scenarios for the next 8 weeks: a scenario in which mobility remains the same as during the lockdown, a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 20%, and a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 40%. The scenarios explored assume that mobility is scaled evenly across all dimensions, that behaviour stays the same as before NPIs were implemented, that no pharmaceutical interventions are introduced, and it does not include transmission reduction from contact tracing, testing and the isolation of confirmed or suspected cases. New interventions, such as enhanced testing and contact tracing are going to be introduced and will likely contribute to reductions in transmission; therefore our estimates should be viewed as pessimistic projections. We find that, in the absence of additional interventions, even a 20% return to pre-lockdown mobility could lead to a resurgence in the number of deaths far greater than experienced in the current wave in several regions. Future increases in the number of deaths will lag behind the increase in transmission intensity and so a second wave will not be immediately apparent from just monitoring of the daily number of deaths. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as mobility should be closely monitored in the next weeks and months. To compensate for the increase in mobility that will occur due to the relaxation of the currently implemented NPIs, adherence to the recommended social distancing measures alongside enhanced community surveillance including swab testing, contact tracing and the early isolation of infections are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of resurgence in transmission.","rel_num_authors":63,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michaela A.

was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread all over the world causing startling loss of lives, stalling the global economy and disrupting the social life. One of the challenges to contain the COVID-19 is making people adopt personal hygiene, social distancing and self-quarantine practices which are all related to knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of the people in respective countries. Bangladesh, the most densely populated countries with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may give the policy makers to make informed decisions. Hence, this study aimed to make a quick assessment of KAP of people in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1837 responses across Bangladesh. However, 1589 completed responses were included in statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores, their interrelations with socio-demographic variables. The overall KAP is poor with only 10% of the respondents showed good knowledge with parallel attitudes and practices. Socio-demographic factors have strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP score is evident in female over male respondents, among aged (45 years and above) over younger respondents and among retired and homemakers above students and public service holders. The study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to gain public confidence and arrest more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures. The study provides a baseline of KAP among people in Bangladesh on COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alak Paul","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Dwaipayan Sikdar","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mosharraf Hossain","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md Robed Amin","author_inst":"Dhaka Medical College"},{"author_name":"Farah Deeba","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Janardan Mahanta","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md.

We evaluated the impact of small-area lockdowns in Chile, aimed to reduce viral transmission while minimizing the population disrupted. The effectiveness of this intervention on the outbreak control is unknown. Methods A natural experiment assessing the impact of small-area lockdowns between February 15th and April 25th, 2020. We used mobility data and official governmental reports to compare regions with small-area lockdowns versus regions without. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the effective reproductive number (Re) of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were changes in mobility indicators. We used quasi-experimental methods for the analysis and examined the impact of other concurrent public health interventions to disentangle their effects. Results Small-area lockdown produced a sizable reduction in human mobility, equivalent to an 11.4% reduction (95%CI -14.4% to -8.38%) in public transport and similar effects in other mobility indicators. Ten days after implementation, the small-area lockdown produced a reduction of the effective reproductive number (Re) of 0.86 (95%CI -1.70 to -0.02). School and university closures, implemented earlier, led to a 40% reduction in urban mobility. Closure of educational institutions resulted in an even greater Re reduction compared with small-area lockdowns.

Small-area lockdowns may have a relevant supporting role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and could be useful for countries considering scaling-down stricter social distancing interventions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Crist\u00f3bal Cuadrado","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Monsalves","author_inst":"Universidad San Sebastian"},{"author_name":"Jean Gajardo","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Paz Bertoglia","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Manuel Najera","author_inst":"Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Tania Alfaro","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Canals","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Jay Kaufmann","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Sebasti\u00e1n Pe\u00f1a","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Lejla Hrusti\u0107","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Zainab Ashraf","author_inst":"Faculty of Arts, University of Waterloo, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sarvin Es haghi","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Luis Rodr\u00edguez-Pino","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Verena Waller","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Jabeen","author_inst":"Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"A.
