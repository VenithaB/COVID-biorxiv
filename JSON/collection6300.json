Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut, was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. Results: COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N=26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID-19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P<0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33-2.78); P<0.001]. Among COVID-19+ patients who were [&ge;]85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation. Conclusions: In this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing. Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities. Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesar Caraballo","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Megan McCullough","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Fuery","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fouad Chouairi","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Keating","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Neal Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elliott Miller","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maricar Malinis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nitu Kashyap","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Allen Hsiao","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francis Perry Wilson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081562","rel_title":"Incidence of COVID-19 and Connections with Air Pollution Exposure: Evidence from the Netherlands","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081562","rel_abs":"The fast spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has resulted in the emergence of several hot-spots around the world. Several of these are located in areas associated with high levels of air pollution. This study investigates the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and COVID-19 incidence in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands. The results show that atmospheric particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. The estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100 percent when pollution concentrations increase by 20 percent. The association between air pollution and case incidence is robust in the presence of data on health-related preconditions, proxies for symptom severity, and demographic control variables. The results are obtained with ground-measurements and satellite-derived measures of atmospheric particulate matter as well as COVID-19 data from alternative dates. The findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in COVID-19 incidence, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Pieter Johannes Andree","author_inst":"World Bank"},{"author_name":"Megan McCullough","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Fuery","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fouad Chouairi","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Keating","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Neal Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elliott Miller","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maricar Malinis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nitu Kashyap","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Allen Hsiao","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francis Perry Wilson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081711","rel_title":"Response strategies for COVID-19 epidemics in African settings: a mathematical modelling study","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081711","rel_abs":"Background The health impact of COVID-19 may differ in African settings as compared to countries in Europe or China due to demographic, epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic factors. We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. Methods We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing, and shielding (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. Results We predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius), peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R 0 . The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature. Discussion In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083378","rel_title":"Ocular toxicity and Hydroxychloroquine: A Rapid Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083378","rel_abs":"Rapid access to evidence is crucial in times of evolving clinical crisis. To that end, we propose a novel mechanism to answer clinical queries: Rapid Meta-Analysis (RMA). Unlike traditional meta-analysis, RMA balances quick time-to-production with reasonable data quality assurances, leveraging Artificial Intelligence to strike this balance. This article presents an example RMA to a currently relevant clinical question: Is ocular toxicity and vision compromise a side effect with hydroxychloroquine therapy? As of this writing, hydroxychloroquine is a leading candidate in the treatment of COVID-19. By combining AI with human analysis, our RMA identified 11 studies looking at ocular toxicity as a side effect and estimated the incidence to be 3.4% (95% CI: 1.11-9.96%). The heterogeneity across the individual study findings was high, and interpretation of the result should take this into account. Importantly, this RMA, from search to screen to analysis, took less than 30 minutes to produce.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Michelson","author_inst":"Evid Science, InferLink"},{"author_name":"Steven Minton","author_inst":"InferLink"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Chow","author_inst":"Evid Science"},{"author_name":"Neil Martin","author_inst":"Pacific Neuroscience Institute, Providence St John's Health Center"},{"author_name":"Mike Ross","author_inst":"Evid Science"},{"author_name":"Amelia Tee","author_inst":"Evid Science"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeptha Curtis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Grant","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric J Velazquez","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nihar Desai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tariq Ahmad","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081901","rel_title":"Enhanced Contact Investigations for Nine Early Travel-Related Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081901","rel_abs":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and has since become pandemic. As part of initial response activities in the United States, enhanced contact investigations were conducted to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission. Methods Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified. Close contacts meeting criteria for active monitoring were followed, and selected individuals were targeted for collection of additional exposure details and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results There were 404 close contacts who underwent active monitoring in the response jurisdictions; 338 had at least basic exposure data, of whom 159 had at least 1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all known close contacts under monitoring, two additional cases were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients. The secondary attack rate among household members, all of whom had at least 1 respiratory sample tested, was 13% (95% CI: 4 - 38%). Conclusions The enhanced contact tracing investigations undertaken around nine early travel-related cases of COVID-19 in the United States identified two cases of secondary transmission, both spouses. Rapid detection and isolation of the travel-associated case patients, enabled by public awareness of COVID-19 among travelers from China, may have mitigated transmission risk among close contacts of these cases.","rel_num_authors":100,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel M Burke","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sharon Balter","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Emily Barnes","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vaughn Barry","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Karri Bartlett","author_inst":"Public Health Madison & Dane County, WI"},{"author_name":"Karlyn D Beer","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Isaac Benowitz","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Holly M Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hollianne Bruce","author_inst":"Snohomish Health District, Everett, WA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Bryant-Genevier","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jordan Cates","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chatham-Stephens","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nora Chea","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Howard Chiou","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Los Angeles County Public Health Department, CA"},{"author_name":"Demian Christiansen","author_inst":"Cook County Department of Public Health, IL"},{"author_name":"Victoria Chu","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shauna Clark","author_inst":"Public Health Seattle-King County, WA"},{"author_name":"Sara H.

across the USA since early March, but at a decreasing rate, where the rate r is defined as the exponential increase. I modeled the way the rate of increase y = log(exp(r)-1) has declined through time in each of the 51 states with the goal of determining whether state-at-home orders correlate with reductions in the rate of spread of the virus. A piecewise linear regression was used, with a single break point. This model can identify whether there was a change in the rate of decline, when the change happened, and which states have shown the greatest improvement in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The piecewise model identified a significant breakpoint on 24 Mar for all states combined, and all states had nearly the same breakpoint. Prior to 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.013 per day, meaning a reduction in the rate of spread from 23.5 pct. per day to 19.5 pct. per day; after 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.070 per day, a reduction from 19.5 pct. per day to 7.5 pct. per day. Prior to 24 Mar there was no significant variation among states in the decline in y, but after 24 Mar there was substantial variation, and the date on which states issued stay at home orders correlated with that variation. Montana, Idaho, and Vermont showed the greatest improvement, while Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa the least. The improvement as measured by the reduction after 24 Mar did not correlate with case density in a state, nor state population.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Condit","author_inst":"Retired"},{"author_name":"Venkatnarayan Ramanathan","author_inst":"IIT(BHU) Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Emily Barnes","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vaughn Barry","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Karri Bartlett","author_inst":"Public Health Madison & Dane County, WI"},{"author_name":"Karlyn D Beer","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Isaac Benowitz","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Holly M Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hollianne Bruce","author_inst":"Snohomish Health District, Everett, WA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Bryant-Genevier","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jordan Cates","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chatham-Stephens","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nora Chea","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Howard Chiou","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Los Angeles County Public Health Department, CA"},{"author_name":"Demian Christiansen","author_inst":"Cook County Department of Public Health, IL"},{"author_name":"Victoria Chu","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shauna Clark","author_inst":"Public Health Seattle-King County, WA"},{"author_name":"Sara H.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been spreading through all the world fastly. In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. First we study the early evolution of the disease, considering a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model. This initial phase shows the usual exponential growth of the number of confirmed cases. In this case, we estimate the parameters of the model based on the data, as well as the epidemic doubling time. After, we analyze all the available data, from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020. In this case, we observe a distinct behavior: a sub-exponential growth. In order to capture this change in the behavior of the evolution of the confirmed cases, we consider the implementation of isolation policies. The modified model agrees well with data. Finally, we consider the relaxation of such policies, and discuss about the ideal period of time to release people to return to their activities.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nuno Crokidakis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Venkatnarayan Ramanathan","author_inst":"IIT(BHU) Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Emily Barnes","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vaughn Barry","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Karri Bartlett","author_inst":"Public Health Madison & Dane County, WI"},{"author_name":"Karlyn D Beer","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Isaac Benowitz","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Holly M Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hollianne Bruce","author_inst":"Snohomish Health District, Everett, WA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Bryant-Genevier","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jordan Cates","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chatham-Stephens","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nora Chea","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Howard Chiou","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Los Angeles County Public Health Department, CA"},{"author_name":"Demian Christiansen","author_inst":"Cook County Department of Public Health, IL"},{"author_name":"Victoria Chu","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shauna Clark","author_inst":"Public Health Seattle-King County, WA"},{"author_name":"Sara H.

optimisation approach","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084517","rel_abs":"Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled an ''on-off'' strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism. The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Rawson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom Brewer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dessislava Veltcheva","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Huntingford","author_inst":"UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology"},{"author_name":"Michael B.

factors for COVID-19 is sub-optimal. We investigated demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank. Methods UK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes. Findings Among 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR 1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza. Interpretation These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing event disrupting lives, health systems, and economies worldwide. Clear data about the pandemic's impact is lacking, namely regarding mortality. This work aims to study the impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of all-cause mortality data made available by different European countries, and to critique their mortality surveillance data. METHODS European countries that had publicly available data about the number of deaths per day\/week were selected (England and Wales, France, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal). Two different methods were selected to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID19: (DEV) deviation from the expected value from homologue periods, and (RSTS) remainder after seasonal time series decomposition. We estimate total, age- and gender-specific excess mortality. Furthermore, we compare different policy responses to COVID-19. RESULTS Excess mortality was found in all 5 countries, ranging from 10.6% in Portugal (DEV) to 98.5% in Italy (DEV). Furthermore, excess mortality is higher than COVID-attributed deaths in all 5 countries. DISCUSSION The impact of COVID-19 on mortality appears to be larger than officially attributed deaths, in varying degrees in different countries. Comparisons between countries would be useful, but large disparities in mortality surveillance data could not be overcome. Unreliable data, and even a lack of cause-specific mortality data undermine the understanding of the impact of policy choices on both direct and indirect deaths during COVID-19. European countries should invest more on mortality surveillance systems to improve the publicly available data.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Felix-Cardoso","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Henrique Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Pedro Rodrigues","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Cruz-Correia","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Donald M.

becoming a global epidemic, leading to concerns regarding the pandemic potential in China and other countries. Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+\/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+\/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+\/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+\/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled. Worldwide preparedness and vulnerability against COVID-19 should be regarded with more care.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lingling Zheng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kang Qin","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shuai Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dong Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Weiyao Liao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huimin Xia","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jinling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Huiying Liang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daniel F.

emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Knowledge of coronavirus-related risk factors can help countries build more systematic and successful responses to COVID-19 disease outbreak. Here we used Supervised Machine Learning and Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) techniques to reveal correlates and patterns of COVID-19 Disease outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: We analyzed time series aggregate data compiled by Johns Hopkins University on the outbreak of COVID-19 disease across SSA. COVID-19 data was merged with additional data on socio-demographic and health indicator survey data for 39 of SSA 48 countries that reported confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus between February 28, 2020 through March 26, 2020. We used supervised machine learning algorithm, Lasso for variable selection and statistical inference. EBK was used to also create a raster estimating the spatial distribution of COVID-19 disease outbreak. Results: The lasso Cross-fit partialing out predictive model ascertained seven variables significantly associated with the risk of coronavirus infection (i.e. new HIV infections among pediatric, adolescent, and middle-aged adult PLHIV, time (days), pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine, incidence of malaria and diarrhea treatment). Our study indicates, the doubling time in new coronavirus cases was 3 days. The steady three-day decrease in coronavirus outbreak rate of change (ROC) from 37% on March 23, 2020 to 23% on March 26, 2020 indicates the positive impact of countries' steps to stymie the outbreak. The interpolated maps show that coronavirus is rising every day and appears to be severely confined in South Africa. In the West African region (i.e. Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal, CotedIviore, Cameroon, and Nigeria), we predict that new cases and deaths from the virus are most likely to increase. Interpretation: Integrated and efficiently delivered interventions to reduce HIV, pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, are essential to accelerating global health efforts. Scaling up screening and increasing COVID-19 testing capacity across SSA countries can help provide better understanding on how the pandemic is progressing and possibly ensure a sustained decline in the ROC of coronavirus outbreak. Funding: Authors were wholly responsible for the costs of data collation and analysis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amobi Andrew Onovo","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria; Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva."},{"author_name":"Akinyemi Atobatele","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abiye Kalaiwo","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Christopher Obanubi","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ezekiel James","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Pamela Gado","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Gertrude Odezugo","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Doreen Magaji","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Dolapo Ogundehin","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Michele Russell","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jason M.R.

reports suggest that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to disproportionate morbidity and mortality among historically disadvantaged populations. The extent to which these disparities are related to socioeconomic versus biologic factors is largely unknown. We investigate the racial and socioeconomic associations of COVID-19 hospitalization among 418,794 participants of the UK Biobank, of whom 549 (0.13%) had been hospitalized. Both black participants (odds ratio 3.4; 95%CI 2.4-4.9) and Asian participants (odds ratio 2.1; 95%CI 1.5-3.2) were at substantially increased risk as compared to white participants. We further observed a striking gradient in COVID-19 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend Deprivation Index - a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation - and household income. Adjusting for such factors led to only modest attenuation of the increased risk in black participants, adjusted odds ratio 3.1 (95%CI 2.0-4.8). These observations confirm and extend earlier preliminary and lay press reports of higher morbidity in non-white individuals in the context of a large population of participants in a national biobank. The extent to which this increased risk relates to variation in pre-existing comorbidities, differences in testing or hospitalization patterns, or additional disparities in social determinants of health warrants further study.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aniruddh Pradip Patel","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Manish D Paranjpe","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Nina P Kathiresan","author_inst":"Milton Academy"},{"author_name":"Manuel A Rivas","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Amit V Khera","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pamela Gado","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Gertrude Odezugo","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Doreen Magaji","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Dolapo Ogundehin","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Michele Russell","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jason M.R.

nasopharyngeal swab to turn negative. A negative nasopharyngeal swab conversion was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case followed by two negative results using RT-PCR assay with samples obtained 24 hours apart Results: 34 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Nineteen (55.9%) patients presented with symptoms, and 14 (41.2%) had pneumonia. Only 21 (61.8%) patients received HCQ. The time to SARS-CoV-2 negativity nasopharyngeal test was significantly longer in patients who received HCQ compared to those who did not receive HCQ (17 [13-21] vs. 10 [4-13] days, p=0.023). HCQ was independently associated with time to negativity test after adjustment for potential confounders (symptoms, pneumonia or oxygen therapy) in multivariable linear regression analysis. On day 14, 47.8% (14\/23) patients tested negative in the HCQ group compared to 90.9% (10\/11) patients who did not receive HCQ (p=0.016). Limitations: Small sample size and retrospective design with a potential risk of selection bias Conclusion: HCQ was associated with a slower viral clearance in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease. Data from ongoing randomized clinical trials with HCQ should provide a definitive answer regarding the efficacy and safety of this treatment.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jihad Mallat","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Fadi Hamed","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Maher Balkis","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mohamed A Mohamed","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Mooty","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Asim Malik","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Nusair","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Bonilla","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Dolapo Ogundehin","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Michele Russell","author_inst":"USAID Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jason M.R.

population to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection from patients or other fellow HCW. At the same time, they can be contagious to highly vulnerable individuals seeking health care. This study aims at estimating the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and associated factors in HCW from a large referral hospital in Barcelona, Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by COVID-19 in the world. Methods: From 28 March to 9 April 2020, we recruited a random sample of 578 HCW from the human resources database of Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. We collected a nasopharyngeal swab for direct SARS-CoV-2 detection through real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), as well as blood for plasma antibody quantification. IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were measured by Luminex. The cumulative prevalence of infection (past or current) was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and\/or antibody seropositivity. Results: Of the 578 total participants, 39 (6.7%, 95% CI: 4.8-9.1) had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 by rRT-PCR, 14 (2.4%, 95% CI: 1.4-4.3) had a positive rRT-PCR at recruitment, and 54 (9.3%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.0) were seropositive for IgM and\/or IgG and\/or IgA against SARS-CoV-2. Of the 54 seropositive HCW, 21 (38.9%) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, although 10 of them (47.6%) reported past COVID-19-compatible symptoms. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.2% (65\/578, 95% CI: 8.9-14.1). Among those with evidence of past or current infection, 40.0% (26\/65) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 46.2% (12\/26) had history of COVID-19-compatible symptoms. The odds of being seropositive was higher in participants who reported any COVID-19 symptom (OR: 8.84, 95% CI: 4.41-17.73). IgM levels positively correlated with age (rho=0.36, p-value=0.031) and were higher in participants with more than 10 days since onset of symptoms (p-value=0.022), and IgA levels were higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic subjects (p-value=0.041). Conclusions: The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among HCW was lower than expected. Thus, being a high-risk population, we anticipate these estimates to be an upper limit to the seroprevalence of the general population. Forty per cent of those with past or present infection had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, which calls for active periodic rRT-PCR testing among all HCW to minimize potential risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto L Garcia-Basteiro","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Gemma Moncunill","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Tortajada","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Marta Vidal","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Caterina Guinovart","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Alfons Jimenez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Santano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sergi Sanz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Susana Mendez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rugh Aguilar","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Mikel J Martinez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Munoz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Prabhu Gounder","author_inst":"County of Los Angeles Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheri T Grigg","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Gunzenhauser","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aron J Hall","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George S Han","author_inst":"County of Santa Clara Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Thomas Haupt","author_inst":"Wisconsin Department of Health Services"},{"author_name":"Michelle Holshue","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hunter","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mireille B Ibrahim","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Max W Jacobs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"M.

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. According to WHO reported, Egypt is among the countries with low confirmed SARS CoV2 infected symptomatic cases and death. We postulate that one of the reasons for this may be due mutations in the viral receptor. Therefore this study was conducted to confirm or reject this postulation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Abouelhoda","author_inst":"Cairo University"},{"author_name":"Abdel-Rahman N.

illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We then tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus on the West Coast. We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Bryan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Gregory Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark H.

Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a respiratory illness, first discovered in China in December 2019 has now spread to 213 countries or territories affecting millions across the globe. We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, for a Rapid Evidence Synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control. Methods: We searched PubMed, websites of ministries, public agencies, multilateral institutions, COVID-19 resource aggregators and pre-prints (without language restrictions) for articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data in a consensus data extraction form with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. Results: We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. We found that CHWs play an important role in building awareness, countering stigma and maintaining essential primary healthcare service delivery. It is essential that CHWs are provided adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and appropriately trained in its usage in the early stages of the pandemic. Wide range of policies and guidance is required to ensure health systems functioning. A clear guidance for prioritizing essential activities, postponing non-essential ones and additional pandemic related activities is crucial. CHWs experience stigmatization, isolation and social exclusion. Psychosocial support, non-performance-based incentives, additional transport allowance, accommodation, child-support, awards and recognition programs have been used in previous pandemics. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes for quick utility by decision makers on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16). Conclusions: CHWs play a critical role in pandemics like COVID-19. It is important to ensure role clarity, training, supportive supervision, as well as their work satisfaction, health and well-being. There is a need for more implementation research on CHWs in pandemics like COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumyadeep Bhaumik","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Moola","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Jyoti Tyagi","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Devaki Nambiar","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Misimi Kakoti","author_inst":"The George Institute for Global Health, India"},{"author_name":"Hadiseh Alimoradi","author_inst":"Kerman University of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rugh Aguilar","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Mikel J Martinez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Munoz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Prabhu Gounder","author_inst":"County of Los Angeles Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheri T Grigg","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Gunzenhauser","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aron J Hall","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George S Han","author_inst":"County of Santa Clara Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Thomas Haupt","author_inst":"Wisconsin Department of Health Services"},{"author_name":"Michelle Holshue","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hunter","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mireille B Ibrahim","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Max W Jacobs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"M.

(COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented in scope. High income countries (HIC) seemingly account for the majority of the mortalities considering that these countries have screened more persons. Low middle income countries (LMIC) countries may experience far worse mortalities considering the existence of a weaker health care system and the several underlying population level morbidities. As a result, it becomes imperative to understand the ecological correlation between critical underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). Method: This is an ecological study using data on COVID-19 cases, prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, adult HIV prevalence, quality of air and life expectancy. We plotted a histogram, performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and used spearman correlation to assess the degree of correlation between COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) and other covariates mentioned above. Result: As at the 31st of March 2020, there were a total of 846,281 cases of COVID-19 from 204 countries and a global case fatality rate of 5% (range 0% to 29%). Angola and Sudan both had the highest CFR of 29%, while Italy had the highest number of deaths (i.e. 12,428) as at 31st of March 2020. Adult HIV prevalence has a significant but weak negative correlation with CFR (correlation coefficient = - 0.24, p value =0.01) while all the other variables have positive correlation with CFR due to COVID-19 though not statistically significant. Of the 204 countries analyzed, only 11 countries (i.e. 5%) had complete datasets across all 5 population level morbidities (i.e. prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy, quality of air, and adult HIV prevalence variables). Correlations of CFR from these 11 countries were similar to that from the 204 countries except for the correlation with quality of air and prevalence of tobacco use. Conclusion: While we interpret our data with caution given the fact that this is an ecological study, our findings suggest that population level factors such as prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy and quality of air are positively correlated with CFR from COVID-19 but, adult HIV prevalence has a weak and negative correlation with COVID-19 CFR and would require extensive research.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"EVAEZI OKPOKORO","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"VICTORIA IGBINOMWANHIA","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"ELIMA JEDY-AGBA","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institue of Human virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"GBENGA KAYODE","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"EZENWA ONYEMATA","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"ALASH'LE ABIMIKU","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rugh Aguilar","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Mikel J Martinez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Munoz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Prabhu Gounder","author_inst":"County of Los Angeles Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheri T Grigg","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Gunzenhauser","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aron J Hall","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George S Han","author_inst":"County of Santa Clara Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Thomas Haupt","author_inst":"Wisconsin Department of Health Services"},{"author_name":"Michelle Holshue","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hunter","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mireille B Ibrahim","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Max W Jacobs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"M.

containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giacomo Albi","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pareschi","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Mattia Zanella","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"GBENGA KAYODE","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"EZENWA ONYEMATA","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"ALASH'LE ABIMIKU","author_inst":"International Research Center of Excellence, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rugh Aguilar","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Mikel J Martinez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Munoz","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Prabhu Gounder","author_inst":"County of Los Angeles Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheri T Grigg","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Gunzenhauser","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aron J Hall","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George S Han","author_inst":"County of Santa Clara Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Thomas Haupt","author_inst":"Wisconsin Department of Health Services"},{"author_name":"Michelle Holshue","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Washington State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hunter","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mireille B Ibrahim","author_inst":"Los Angeles County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Max W Jacobs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"M.

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation is depleted causing the incidence of new cases to decline. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M. Gabriela M.

analytical performance of seven kits for detecting IgM\/IgG antibody of corona virus (2019-nCoV) by using four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems. Methods 50 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection and 130 controls without corona virus infection from the people's hospital of Chongqing were enrolled in current retrospective study. Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems including seven IgM\/IgG antibody detection Kits for 2019-nCoV (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM, C_IgG, D_Ab) were employed to detecting antibody concentration. Chi-square test,receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden's index were demonstrated to verify the cutoff value of each detection system. Results The repeatability verification results of the A, B, C, and D system are all qualified. D-Ab performances best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM worse than other systems. Except for the system of A_IgM and C_IgG, the optimal diagnostic thresholds and cutoff value of other kits from recommendations are inconsistent with each other. B_IgM got the worst AUC and C_IgG had the best diagnostic accuracy. More importantly, B_IgG system have the highest false positive rate for testing patients with AIDS, tumor and pregnant. A_IgM system test showed highest false positive rates among elder over 90 years old. Conclusions Systems for CoVID-2019 IgM\/IgG antibody test performance difference. Serum diagnosis kit of D-Ab is the most reliable detecting system for 2019-nCoV antibody, which can be used as an alternative method for nucleic acid testing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yafang Wan","author_inst":"Chongqing General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Kun Wang","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Tian Li","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Pu Liao","author_inst":"The General Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Jorge Carneiro","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Goncalves","author_inst":"Universidade do Porto, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Carlos Penha-Goncalves","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Marcelo U.

created the need for development of new therapeutic strategies. Understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry and replication has become a key aspect of such interventions. The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential for viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry. Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of hACE2 expressed in HEK293 human cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100%) at all seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site. To deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 that may be involved in viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc, and the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectrum, in addition to using bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2 glycosylation. Our elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the hACE2 receptor, along with the modeling of hACE2 glycosylation sites can aid in understanding the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and assist in the development of novel therapeutics to prevent viral entry. The relevance of studying the role of ACE2 is further increased due to some recent reports about the varying ACE2 dependent complications with regard to age, sex, race, and pre-existing conditions of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Shajahan","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Archer-Hartmann","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Nitin T Supekar","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Anne S.

As a result, there is an urgent need to create new disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and to screen for therapeutics using human disease-relevant tissues. COVID-19 patients typically present with respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, but nearly 25% of patients have gastrointestinal indications including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, these symptoms are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. Here, we report using human pluripotent stem cell-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the permissiveness of colonic cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell types, but highly enriched in enterocytes. Multiple cell types in the COs can be infected by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, which was further validated in vivo using a humanized mouse model. We used hPSC-derived COs in a high throughput platform to screen 1280 FDA-approved drugs against viral infection. Mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride were found to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus in COs both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed to block infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study established both in vitro and in vivo organoid models to investigate infection of SARS-CoV-2 disease-relevant human colonic cell types and identified drugs that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, suitable for rapid clinical testing.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohua Duan","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuling Han","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liuliu Yang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Nilsson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tuo Zhang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xing Wang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jenny Zhaoying Xiang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"skyler uhl","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Chen","author_inst":"the University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, 201210 Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R. tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert  E.

threatens global public health and economy. In order to develop safe and effective vaccines, suitable animal models must be established. Here we report the rapid adaption of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB\/c mice, based on which a convenient, economical and effective animal model was developed. Specifically, we found that mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 at passage 6 (MACSp6) efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type BALB\/c mice, resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses. The elevated infectivity of MACSp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue (N501Y) in the receptorbinding domain (RBD). Using this novel animal model, we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against SARS-CoV-2 MACSp6 challenge. This novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nSummaryThis study describes a unique mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and confirms protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongjing Gu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Qi Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lei He","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hang Fan","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yanxiao Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Teng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhongpeng Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yuchang Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Jiangfan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Nana Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.

However, when the virus enters the body it interacts not only with the host but also with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by the viral invasion. Here we present a framework for comparative functional analysis of microbiomes, the results from which can lead to new hypotheses on the host-microbiome interactions in healthy versus afflicted cohorts. We carry out a functional analysis of previously published RNA sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 patients, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The resulting microbial functional profiles and their top differentiating features clearly separate the cohorts. We also detect differentially abundant microbiome pathway signatures in COVID-19 compared to both the community-acquired pneumonia and healthy cohorts. By utilizing randomization to evaluate the significance of the findings, we highlight pathways with altered abundance in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes, including decreased lipid and glycan metabolism.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niina Haiminen","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Filippo Utro","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Ed Seabolt","author_inst":"IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Laxmi Parida","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Hang Fan","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yanxiao Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Teng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhongpeng Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yuchang Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Jiangfan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Nana Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shaolong Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Guangyu Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiliang Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Deyan Luo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gencheng Han","author_inst":"Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuxian He","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Zhou","author_inst":"Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Geng","author_inst":"Beijing Joinn Biologics Co.
