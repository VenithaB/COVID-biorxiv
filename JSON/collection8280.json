With over 7 million confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved cryo-EM structure of ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) 1 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD 1 helix (SBP1) composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of SBP1 was complete in 1.5 hours, and after work up and isolation >20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) revealed that SBP1 associates with micromolar affinity to insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein obtained from Sino Biological. Association of SBP1 was not observed to an appreciable extent to HEK cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2-RBD proteins and insect-derived variants acquired from other vendors. Moreover, competitive BLI assays showed SBP1 does not outcompete ACE2 binding to Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Further investigations are ongoing to gain insight into the molecular and structural determinants of the variable binding behavior to different SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein variants.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genwei Zhang","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Pomplun","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Alexander Robert Loftis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuyu Tan","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andrei Loas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bradley L.

Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog {beta}-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. The potency of NHC\/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses, its therapeutic efficacy, and oral bioavailability in vivo, all highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Amy C Sims","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Shuntai Zhou","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Collin Hill","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Maria Agostini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pruijssers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Ariane J Brown","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Gregory Bluemling","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Natchus","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Manohar Saindane","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kolykhalov","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"George Painter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ronald Swanstrom","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV\/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3-fluoro-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension.

Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of {approx} 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. In addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. Our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pai Liu","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Payton Beeler","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Rajan K Chakrabarty","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Chuanjuan Tao","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxu Li","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"James J.

Methods: 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army between January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited. Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated. Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and\/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o. Conclusions: ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum samples from patients after 10 d.p.o, it can be an important supplementary method for COVID-19 diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wanbing Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Guomei Kou","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yaqiong Zheng","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yinjuan Ding","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Wenxu Ni","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Qiongshu Wang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Li Tan","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Wanlei Wu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Shi Tang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Zhou Xiong","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Shangen Zheng","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kolykhalov","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"George Painter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ronald Swanstrom","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

Italy has even taken measures to close the city nationwide, with a total of 118,020 cases of infection worldwide. 1.2 Method This article selects the data of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 at home and abroad as the data sample. Among them: the data of newly confirmed cases abroad is represented by Italy, and the span is from February 13 to March 10. The data of newly confirmed cases at home are divided into two parts: Hubei Province and other provinces except Hubei Province, spanning from January 23 to March 3, and with February 12 as the cutting point, it is divided into two periods, the growth period and the recession period. The rescaled range (R \/ S) analysis method and the dimensionless fractal Hurst exponent are used to measure the correlation of time series to determine whether the time series conforms to the fractal Brownian motion, that is, a biased random process. Contrast analysis of the meaning of H value in different stages and different overall H values in the same stage. 1.3 Results Based on R \/ S analysis and calculated Hurst value of newly confirmed cases in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces, it was found that the H value of Hubei Province in the first stage was 0.574, which is greater than 0.5, indicating that the future time series has a positive correlation and Fractal characteristics; The H value in the second stage is 1.368, which is greater than 1, which indicates that the future epidemic situation is completely preventable and controllable, and the second stage has a downward trend characteristic, which indicates that there is a high probability that the future time series will decline. The H values of the first and second stages of non-Hubei Province are 0.223 and 0.387, respectively, which are both less than 0.5, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the future is likely to return to historical points, and the H value in the second stage is greater than that in the first stage, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the second stage is more long-term memory than the time series of confirmed cases in the first stage. The daily absolute number of newly confirmed cases in Italy was converted to the daily growth rate of confirmed cases to eliminate the volatility of the data. The H value was 1.853, which was greater than 1, indicating that the time series of future confirmed cases is similar to the trend of historical changes. The daily rate of change in cases will continue to rise. 1.4 Conclusion According to the different interpretation of the H value obtained by the R \/ S analysis method, hierarchical isolation measures are adopted accordingly. When the H value is greater than 0.5, it indicates that the development of the epidemic situation in the area has more long-term memory, that is, when the number of confirmed cases in the past increases rapidly, the probability of the time series of confirmed cases in the future will continue the historical trend. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate strict anti-epidemic measures in accordance with the actual conditions of various countries, to detect, isolate, and treat early to reduce the base of infectious agents.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Ji","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhou Tang","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kejian Wang","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xianbin Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Houqiang Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Claudia Balotta","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Maciej Tarkowski","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Arianna Gabrieli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Dario Bernacchia","author_inst":"III Division of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Rusconi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Giuliano Rizzardini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"George Painter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ronald Swanstrom","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic's magnitude. Findings suggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemic more rapidly under control.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Katsushi Kagaya","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Xianbin Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Houqiang Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Claudia Balotta","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Maciej Tarkowski","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Arianna Gabrieli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Dario Bernacchia","author_inst":"III Division of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Rusconi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Giuliano Rizzardini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"George Painter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ronald Swanstrom","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities\/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities\/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biqing Chen","author_inst":"Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hao Liang","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Yuan","author_inst":"Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yingying Hu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yating Zhao","author_inst":"School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Binfen Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fang Tian","author_inst":"Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xuejun Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of C"},{"author_name":"Stefano Rusconi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Giuliano Rizzardini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"George Painter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ronald Swanstrom","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

However, with significant numbers of false negatives, improvements to GICA are needed. Methods: Six recombinant HCoV-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared and evaluated. The optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich-format GICA strip to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19. GICA performance was assessed with comparison of viral RNA detection. Results: Recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were obtained, including three prokaryotically expressed rN, rN1, rN2 nucleocapsid proteins, and three eukaryotically expressed rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc spike proteins. The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) against coronavirus-specific IgM and IgG were chosen for GICA development. The GICA has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.89% (106\/122) and 99.39% (656\/660), respectively. Furthermore, 65.63% (21\/32) of the clinically confirmed but RT-PCR negative samples were GICA positive. Conclusions: The eukaryotically-expressed spike proteins (rS1and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for HCoV-19 serological diagnosis. The GICA sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a powerful complement to the current standard RNA-based tests.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pingping Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Tang Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuehua Ke","author_inst":"Huoshenshan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fei Mo","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ruizhong Jia","author_inst":"Huoshenshan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wanbing Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Threater Command of the PLA"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Threater Command of the PLA"},{"author_name":"Shangen Zheng","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Yuzhen Liu","author_inst":"Shijiazhuang Fifth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Luping Li","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Yao Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

We aimed to assess the association between prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) and mortality in patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation from February 12nd to March 2nd, 2020. All patients were followed until death or March 28th, and all survivors were followed for at least 30 days. Results: For 36 hospitalized COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (10.8) years, and 30 patients (83.3%) were men. Twenty two (61.1%) patients received PIRRT (PIRRT group) and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed with conventional strategy (non PIRRT group). There were no differences in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings. During median follow up period of 9.5 (interquartile range 4.3 33.5) days, 13 of 22 (59.1%) patients in the PIRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in the non-PIRRT group died. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated prolonged survival in patients in the PIRRT group compared with that in the non PIRRT group (P = 0.042). The association between PIRRT and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant in three different models, with adjusted hazard ratios varying from 0.332 to 0.398. Higher levels of IL2 receptor, TNFa, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, and NT proBNP were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with PIRRT. Conclusion: PIRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yi Yang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jia Shi","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuwang Ge","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuiming Guo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xue Xing","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yanan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anying Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qingquan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Ning","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Fan He","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, UK. We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70,000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Further work is needed to establish the occurrence\/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sema Nickbakhsh","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Antonia Ho","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Diogo F.P.

In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (R0=3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (R0=2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comte. Our analysis shows that, even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed. While drastic social distancing measures may temper our results, a massive reorganization leading to an expansion of French ICU capacities seems to be necessary to manage the coming wave of critically affected COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9ment Massonnaud","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449; Rouen University Hospital, Department of Biostatistics"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Roux","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Pascal Cr\u00e9pey","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Health Protection Scotland, NHS National Services Scotland"},{"author_name":"Rory R.

If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases. The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Tao","author_inst":"Southwest University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Roux","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Pascal Cr\u00e9pey","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Health Protection Scotland, NHS National Services Scotland"},{"author_name":"Rory R.

Methods.The ChiCTR database was comprehensively searched, and the COVID-19 research registration information as of February 24, 2020 was counted. Descriptive analysis of registration time trends and geographical distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare the statistical differences between different study types, intervention methods, research phases and major sponsors. Frequency studies were used to analyze the characteristics of CMT and BI therapy. Results.232 COVID-19 studies registered at the ChiCTR Center were collected. The overall number of COVID-19 registrations was increased. Hubei Province, China has the largest number of registrations, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. There were significant differences between the number of participants (P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000), and blind method (P=0.000) for different study types. Significant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study(P=0.022), of participants numbe(P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods. There were significant differences in study assignment (P=0.043) between the early and late studies. CMT drugs with high research frequency are chloroquine, lopinavir \/ ritonavir, and I-IFN, which are all in phase 4; BI was Cell therapy, plasma therapy, Thymosin, and M\/P-AB, which are all in early stages. Conclusion.There were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions. Different research types, intervention methods, and research stages lead to significant differences in some dimensions of the COVID-19 study. Finally, statistical high-frequency research drugs can provide more treatment options and evidence-based evidence for the clinical practice.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"gao song","author_inst":"Puer Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"meng qun cheng","author_inst":"Puer Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"xian wen wei","author_inst":"Puer Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Angus Cameron","author_inst":"Ausvet Europe"},{"author_name":"Mattia Prosperi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Faiz Elfaki","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Emma McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Hao Pei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine,Wuxi No.5 People's Hospital,Jiangsu,China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Li","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology,Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering,Hebei, China"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Lass-Florl","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology,Medical University of Innsbruck,Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design: Rapid evidence review. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results: We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Webster","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Samantha Brooks","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Louise Smith","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lisa Woodland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Faiz Elfaki","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Emma McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Hao Pei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine,Wuxi No.5 People's Hospital,Jiangsu,China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Li","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology,Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering,Hebei, China"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Lass-Florl","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology,Medical University of Innsbruck,Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations\/month. Findings: The country-specific R revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. Outside China, R estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. GENI scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. Integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. Interpretation: R was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. Integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic R, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. Synergistically, GENI provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. We calculated an instantaneous country-specific R at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DJ Darwin R Bandoy","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Bart C Weimer","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Louise Smith","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lisa Woodland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Faiz Elfaki","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Emma McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Hao Pei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine,Wuxi No.5 People's Hospital,Jiangsu,China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Li","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology,Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering,Hebei, China"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Lass-Florl","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology,Medical University of Innsbruck,Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3\/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2\/first day followed by 600mg*2\/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71\/116) and Arbidol group (62\/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213). Favipiravir led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, P<0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, P<0.0001). No difference was observed of AOT or NMV rate (both P>0.05). The most frequently observed Favipiravir-associated adverse event was raised serum uric acid (16\/116, OR: 5.52, P=0.0014). Conclusions Among patients with COVID-19, Favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinically recovery rate at Day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused Favipiravir are mild and manageable.

However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for immunology, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ling Ni","author_inst":"Institute for immunology, School of medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fang Ye","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Li Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lin Sun","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Han Guo","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

However, a retrospective surveillance study identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far surpasses the 425 confirmed cases reported across all age groups, none of which were children under age 15. Children are strikingly absent from COVID-19 reports and limited data suggest that pediatric infections are overwhelmingly mild5. Thus, our estimates for hundreds of severe pediatric cases likely translates to thousands or even tens of thousands of mildly infected children, suggesting that the force of infection from children may be grossly underestimated and the infection fatality rate overestimated from confirmed case counts alone. This highlights the urgent need for more robust surveillance to gauge the true extent and severity of COVID-19 in all ages.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ciara Nugent","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Cowling","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lin Sun","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Han Guo","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.

Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We compared the clinical features on admission among patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19 at the end of observation. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship from February 11 to February 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 26, 2020. Clinical features on admission were compared among those with different disease severity at the end of observation. Univariate analysis identified factors associated with symptom onset and disease progression. Findings: The median age was 68 years, and 54 patients were male. Briefly, 43, 41, and 20 patients on admission and 33, 43, and 28 patients at the end of observation had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Serum lactate hydrogenase levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age, consolidation on chest computed tomography, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19 at the end of observation. Interpretation: Lactate dehydrogenase level is a potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19. Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management. Funding: Not applicable.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sakiko Tabata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuo Imai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuichi Kawano","author_inst":"Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Medical Service School"},{"author_name":"Mayu Ikeda","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Kodama","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Obinata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Mimura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Kodera","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Manabu Kitagaki","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michiya Sato","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Suzuki","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuhide Uwabe","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Natalie J.
