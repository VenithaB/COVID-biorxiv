The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19. Aims of the study: this review aimed to report any evidence of therapeutics used for the management of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice since the emergence of the virus. Methods: A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA Statement. Articles for review were selected from electronic databases (Embase, Medline and Google Scholar). Readily accessible peer-reviewed full articles in English published from December 1 st , 2019 to March 26 th , 2020 were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, antiviral, antibacterial. There were no restrictions on the type of study design eligible for inclusion. Results: As of March 26, 2020, of the initial manuscripts identified (n=449) articles. Forty-one studies were included, of which clinical trials (n=3), (case reports n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies. Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%). The most common mentioned and reported medicine in this systematic review was corticosteroids (n=25), followed by Lopinavir (n=21) and oseltamivir (n=16). Conclusions: This is the first systematic review up to date related to the therapeutics used in COVID-19 patients. Only forty-one research articles on COVID-19 and therapeutics were found eligible to be included, most conducted in China, corticosteroid therapy was found to be the most used medicine in these studies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mansour Tobaiqy","author_inst":"BSc, MSc Clin.

If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity or reduce length of stay. Methods A stochastic discrete event simulation model is developed to represent the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. Model inputs are aligned to levers available to planners with key outputs including duration of time at maximum capacity (to inform workforce requirements), peak daily deaths (for mortuary planning), and total deaths (as an ultimate marker of intervention efficacy). The model - freely available - is applied to the COVID-19 response at a large hospital in England for which the effect of a number of possible interventions are simulated. Results Capacity-dependent deaths are closely associated with both the nature and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and availability of intensive care beds. For the hospital considered, results suggest that capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced five-fold through a combination of isolation policies, a doubling of bed capacity, and 25% reduced length of stay. Conclusions Without treatment or vaccination there is little that can be done to reduce deaths occurring when patients have otherwise been treated in the most appropriate hospital setting. Healthcare planners should therefore focus on minimising the capacity-dependent deaths that are within their influence.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard M Wood","author_inst":"UK National Health Service and University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Christopher J McWilliams","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Thomas","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Christopher P Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Christos Vasilakis","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Azhar Kamal","author_inst":"Assistant Professor, 1-Department of Biochemistry College of Science University of Jeddah,  Jeddah, Saudi Arabia 2-Centre for Science and Medical Research (UJC-"},{"author_name":"Nawal Helmi","author_inst":"Assistant Professor, 1- Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, College of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Jeddah  2- Department of Biochemistry, C"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20050773","rel_title":"Exponential phase of covid19 expansion is not driven by climate at global scale","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20050773","rel_abs":"The pandemic state of COVID-19 caused by the SARS CoV-2 put the world in quarantine, led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and is causing an unprecedented economic crisis.

In this consequence, it is top critical priority to become aware of the infected people so that prevention procedures can be processed to minimize the COVID-19 spread and to begin early medical health care of those infected persons. In this paper, the deep studying based totally methodology is usually recommended for the detection of COVID-19 infected patients using X-ray images. The help vector gadget classifies the corona affected X-ray images from others through usage of the deep features. The technique is useful for the clinical practitioners for early detection of COVID-19 infected patients. The suggested system of multi-level thresholding plus SVM presented high accuracy in classification of the infected lung with Covid-19.

As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic. The majority of existing models assume random diffusion but do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals, i.e. the underlying human interaction network, whose structure is known to be scale-free. Here, we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Using stochastic simulations in a scale-free network, we show that the epidemic can propagate for a long time at a low level before the number of infected individuals suddenly increases markedly, and that this increase occurs shortly after the first hub is infected. We further demonstrate that mitigation strategies that target hubs are far more effective than strategies that randomly decrease the number of connections between individuals. Although applicable to infectious disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID-19 epidemiological models.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Helena A Herrmann","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Kadry Ali Ezzat Jr.","author_inst":"Higher Technological Institute, Biomedical Engineering Department"},{"author_name":"Haytham H.

Outpatient Fever Clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution. Design: A population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC. Methods: The FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected. Conclusion: The work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital as well as offload ED resources.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiangshan Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liang Zong Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhang Sr.","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Han Sun Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Walline Harold Joseph Sr.","author_inst":"Accident and Emergency Medicine Academic Unit, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Pengxia Sun","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengyong Xu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunting Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jihai Liu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Xu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuezhong Yu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huadong Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20043992","rel_title":"Anxiety, worry and perceived stress in the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, March 2020.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19: a public health emergency of international concern. Having into consideration the lockdown and quarantine situation, we decided to do evaluate the current emotional state on the general population with a web-based survey in English and in Spanish, which was considered a useful and fast method that could help us determine how people perceived stress and worry due to the COVID-19. Methods: The survey included a 22 items, gathering information in 3 sections: Sociodemographic data, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) by Cohen and additional queries that assessed the current worry and change of behaviours due to this pandemic. Results: The survey received 891 respondents from 25 countries, from March 17 to 23rd, 2020. The mean age of the respondents was 43.8 (14.2) years old, and more than two thirds were women. 12.8% were health personnel.The mean of the PSS-10 score was 17.4 (6.4). Significantly higher scores were observed among women, youth, students, and among those who expressed concern and those who perceived increased susceptibility to the COVID-19. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the health professionals and the general population. A good correlation was observed between mean relative volume (RSV) of the las 14 days and the number of cases reported (rho = 0.68, p <0.001) and deaths (rho = 0.51, p <0.001).

Object: Support for policymaking requires forecasting of the entire course and outcome of the outbreak if a self-restraint in going out is not initiated. Moreover, the effects of a self-restraint in going out must be considered when choosing to initiate one. Method: Data of Tokyo patients with symptoms during January 14 - March 28, 2020 were used to formulate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model using three age classes and to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0). Based on the estimated R0, We inferred outbreak outcomes and medical burden if a self-restraint in going out were not enacted. Then we estimate the self-restraint in going out effects. Results: Results suggest R0 as 2.86, with a 95% confidence interval of [2.73, 2.97]. Exhaustion of medical resources can be expected to occur on April 26 if no self-restraint in going out occurs. If a self-restraint in going out were enacted from April 6, and if more than 60% of trips outside the home were restricted voluntarily, then medical care service could be maintained. Discussion and Conclusion: The estimated R0 was similar to that found from other studies conducted in China and Japan. Results demonstrate that a self-restraint in going out with reasonable cooperation of residents is required to maintain medical care.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junko Kurita","author_inst":"Department of Nursig, Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tamie Sugawara","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Ohkusa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Anne Drewry","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roger Bedimo","author_inst":"VA North Texas Health Care System and UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Erik Kulstad","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shengyong Xu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunting Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jihai Liu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Xu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuezhong Yu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huadong Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20047373","rel_title":"Frequency of testing for COVID 19 infection and the presence of higher number of available beds per country predict outcomes with the infection, not the GDP of the country - A descriptive statistical analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20047373","rel_abs":"Introduction: The novel coronavirus epidemic which originated in late 2019 from China has wreaked havoc on millions across the world with illness, death and socioeconomic recession. As of now no valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved worldwide and governments across the world have been forced to take the draconian step of social isolation in communities by enforcing lockdowns. Aim of this Study: This study aims to correlate the rates of infection with the novel coronavirus and total deaths as the primary output variable. In addition the strength of association between infection rates and total death in comparison to GDP share of the respective countries, physicians, hospital beds and rates of testing for COVID 19 infection per thousand patients, is being assessed, in a bid to develop a model which would help to develop tools to reduce the impact of this disease. Material & Methods Data relating to number of cases, severity, cases recovered and deaths worldwide and specifically for the top six countries affected was collected from the WHO COVID-19 situation report which is being updated on a daily basis till 22nd March 2020, the date of analysis. Additional data related to GDP, physician and hospital bed per 1000 patients were procured from the World Bank database. All data were collected in a file in CSV format. Analysis was conducted in Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 software and also with XL-Stat statistical software for excel. The analytical strategy was descriptive with no inferential overtones. Results: COVID 19 infection strongly correlates with total deaths (r : 0.89), with a predicted death rate of 25 patients per 1000 affected. There was no correlation between the GDP growth of the country and number of treating physicians\/1000 patient population with any COVID 19 related outcome. However there was a negative correlation between COVID 19-related deaths and the number of beds available per 1000 population [r=-0.34]. Importantly there is an inverse correlation between the number of tests conducted per million population with the rates of active infections [r=-0.12] , new cases [r=-0.38] and new deaths [r=-0.28] in COVID 19. Conclusion: This is the first study to assess parameters other than age and sex and sets out a robust dataset which indicates an increased risk of worsening outcomes with lesser number of beds and testing, suggesting that the need of the hour is to increase available bed numbers and to increase rates of testing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SAMIT GHOSAL","author_inst":"Nightingale Hospital"},{"author_name":"Binayak Sinha","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sumit Sengupta","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Milan Majumder","author_inst":"Independent Biostatistician"},{"author_name":"Roger Bedimo","author_inst":"VA North Texas Health Care System and UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Erik Kulstad","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shengyong Xu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunting Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jihai Liu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Xu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuezhong Yu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huadong Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20051722","rel_title":"Urinalysis, but not blood biochemistry, detects the early renal-impairment in patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20051722","rel_abs":"Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused infectious disease, termed COVID-19, outbroke in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 patients manifested as lung injury with complications in other organs, such as liver, heart, gastrointestinal tract, especially for severe cases. However, whether COVID-19 causes significant acute kidney injury (AKI) remained controversial. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, urine and blood routine tests and other laboratory parameters of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Union Hospital. Findings: 178 patients, admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from February 02 to February 29, 2020, were included in this study. No patient (0 [0%]) presented increased serum creatinine (Scr), and 5 (2.8%) patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating few cases with kidney dysfunction. However, for patients (83) with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon hospitalization, 45 (54.2%) patients displayed abnormality in urinalysis, such as proteinuria, hematuria and leukocyturia, while none of the patients was recorded to have acute kidney injury (AKI) throughout the study. Meanwhile, the patients with abnormal urinalysis usually had worse disease progression reflecting by laboratory parameters presentations, including markers of liver injury, inflammation, and coagulation. Conclusion: Many patients manifested by abnormal urinalysis on admission, including proteinuria or hematuria. Our results revealed that urinalysis is better in unveiling potential kidney impairment of COVID-19 patients than blood chemistry test and urinalysis could be used to reflect and predict the disease severity. We therefore recommend pay more attention in urinalysis and kidney impairment in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haifeng zhou Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zili Zhang Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Fan Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junyi Li Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mingyue Li Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yalan Dong Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Weina Guo Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lan Lin Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhenyu Kang Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ting Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Tian Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Gui Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Renjie Qin Jr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Haijun Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"ShanShan Luo Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Desheng Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"urology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20047977","rel_title":"ACE2 variants underlie interindividual variability and susceptibility to COVID-19 in Italian population","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20047977","rel_abs":"In December 2019, an initial cluster of interstitial bilateral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China. A human-to-human transmission was assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus-disease-19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was described. The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization. Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for inter-individual disease susceptibility and\/or severity. Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined whole-exome-sequencing data of 6930 Italian control individuals from five different centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three more common missense changes, p.(Asn720Asp), p.(Lys26Arg), p.(Gly211Arg) were predicted to interfere with protein structure and stabilization. Rare variants likely interfering with the internalization process, namely p.(Leu351Val) and p.(Pro389His), predicted to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, were also observed. Comparison of ACE2 WES data between a cohort of 131 patients and 258 controls allowed identifying a statistically significant (P value <0,029) higher allelic variability in controls compared to patients. These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed inter-individual clinical variability associated with COVID-19, allowing an evidence-based risk assessment leading to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisa Benetti","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese"},{"author_name":"Ottavia Spiga","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ciolfi","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Roma"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Birolo","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bruselles","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Doddato","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Cterina Marconi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Musacchia","author_inst":"Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, Pozzuoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Pippucci","author_inst":"Sant Orsola Malpighi University Hospital, Bologna"},{"author_name":"Annalaura Torella","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Caserta, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Trezza","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Floriana Valentino","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Mrgherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Brusco","author_inst":"University of Turin"},{"author_name":"Rosanna Asselta","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruttini Mirella","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Marco Seri","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Nigro","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Matullo","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Tartaglia","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Mari","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Renieri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Annamaria Pinto","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20047530","rel_title":"Estimating Impact of Austerity policies in COVID-19 fatality rates:Examining the dynamics of economic policy and Case Fatality Rates (CFR) of COVID-19 in OCED countries","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20047530","rel_abs":"The paper will attempt to estimate factors which determine the variability of case fatality rates of COVID-19 across OECD countries in the recent time.

We used a planar beam of laser light passing through a dust-free enclosure to detect saliva droplets emitted while speaking. We found that saying the words 'Stay Healthy' generates thousands of droplets that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. A damp homemade cloth face mask dramatically reduced droplet excretion, with none of the spoken words causing a droplet rise above the background.

In this study, 11 key blood indices were extracted through random forest algorithm to build the final assistant discrimination tool from 49 clinical available blood test data which were derived by commercial blood test equipments. The method presented robust outcome to accurately identify COVID-19 from a variety of suspected patients with similar CT information or similar symptoms, with accuracy of 0.9795 and 0.9697 for the cross-validation set and test set, respectively. The tool also demonstrated its outstanding performance on an external validation set that was completely independent of the modeling process, with sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 0.9512, 0.9697, and 0.9595, respectively. Besides, 24 samples from overseas infected patients with COVID-19 were used to make an in-depth clinical assessment with accuracy of 0.9167. After multiple verification, the reliability and repeatability of the tool has been fully evaluated, and it has the potential to develop into an emerging technology to identify COVID-19 and lower the burden of global public health.

We estimated the number and percent of excess deaths due to COVID-19 In April 2020 in the United States, New York City, and Michigan. Methods: For each locale we calculated attributable fractions in the exposed comparing observed COVID-19 deaths and expected deaths. In addition, we estimated the number of months it would take for the excess deaths to occur without the virus and the proportions of the populations that were infected leading to the April deaths. We compared the excess deaths from the attributable fraction method to those obtained by comparing weekly deaths in 2019 and 2020. Results: Using an assumed infection fatality rate of 1%, the percentages of excess deaths were 95%, 97%, and 95% in the US, NYC, and MI equivalent to 54,560; 14,951; and 3,338 deaths, respectively. Absent the virus these deaths would have occurred over 21.0, 29.2, and 18.4 months in the respective locations. An estimated 1.7% of the US population was infected between March 13 and April 10, 2020. Nearly 19% were infected in NYC. Conclusions: Over 75% of COVID-19 deaths in April 2020 were excess deaths meaning they would not have occurred in April without SARS-CoV-2 but would have been spread out over the ensuing 18 to 29 months. Confirmed cases in the US under-report the actual number of infections by at least an order of magnitude. Excess death numbers calculated using the attributable fraction in the exposed are similar to those obtained from weekly mortality reports.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harry P Wetzler","author_inst":"Ofstead and Associates"},{"author_name":"Erica A Wetzler","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liting Zhang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Wenbo Meng","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Junfeng Li","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chongxiang Tong","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Hospital of Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Li","author_inst":"Gansu Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Cai","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Hospital of Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Zengwei Yang","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Hospital of Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Jinhong Zhu","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Meie Zhao","author_inst":"the First People Hospital of Lanzhou City"},{"author_name":"Huirong Huang","author_inst":"the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Xie","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shuyan Li","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mrgherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Brusco","author_inst":"University of Turin"},{"author_name":"Rosanna Asselta","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruttini Mirella","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Marco Seri","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Nigro","author_inst":"University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Matullo","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Tartaglia","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Mari","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Renieri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Annamaria Pinto","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.019877","rel_title":"Leveraging mRNAs sequences to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens in vivo","rel_date":"2020-04-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.019877","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine is urgently needed.

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yifei Lang","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Wentao Li","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Zeshi Li","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences and Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Utrecht Universit"},{"author_name":"Danielle Koerhuis","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Arthur C.S. van den Burg","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Erik Rozemuller","author_inst":"GenDx B.V., Yalelaan 48, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Berend-Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the +RNA virus family that utilize single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteins - the matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) - and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD lined with arginine residues suggesting a putative RNA binding site. Next, we performed an NMR titration experiment using an RNA duplex. The observed changes in positions of signals in the N-NTD NMR spectra allowed us to construct a model of the N-NTD in complex with RNA.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhurvas Chandrasekaran Dinesh","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Dominika Chalupska","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Jan Silhan","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Vaclav Veverka","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Evzen Boura","author_inst":"Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Erik Rozemuller","author_inst":"GenDx B.V., Yalelaan 48, 3584 CM Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Berend-Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld","author_inst":"Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases. Although number of-available full-genomes is growing daily, and the full dataset contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 datasets still present severe limitations. Studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating. Hence the need for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.\n\nSignificance StatementAlthough genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are growing daily and contain sufficient phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carla Mavian","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Simone Marini","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Mattia Prosperi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Sijin Wu","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaolin Sun","author_inst":"Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Chen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Yongliang Yang","author_inst":"Dalian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro.\n\nThe main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2 is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ernesto Estrada","author_inst":"Institute of Mathematics and Applications, University of Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Simone Marini","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Mattia Prosperi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Sijin Wu","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaolin Sun","author_inst":"Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Chen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Yongliang Yang","author_inst":"Dalian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan P.H.

We previously demonstrated that four nucleotide analogues (specifically, the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, AZT and Tenofovir alafenamide) inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Tenofovir and emtricitabine are the two components in DESCOVY and TRUVADA, the two FDA-approved medications for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. This is a preventative method in which individuals who are HIV negative (but at high-risk of contracting the virus) take the combination drug daily to reduce the chance of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP can stop HIV from replicating and spreading throughout the body. We report here that the triphosphates of tenofovir and emtricitabine, the two components in DESCOVY and TRUVADA, act as terminators for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp catalyzed reaction. These results provide a molecular basis to evaluate the potential of DESCOVY and TRUVADA as PrEP for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen Jockusch","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Chuanjuan Tao","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxu Li","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Thomas K.

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC\/paratopic binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, IC50, MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amrita Banerjee","author_inst":"Oriental Institute of Science and Technology, Midnapore, India"},{"author_name":"Dipannita Santra","author_inst":"Oriental Institute of Science and Technology, Midnapore, India"},{"author_name":"Smarajit Maiti","author_inst":"Oriental Institute of Science and Technology, Midnapore, India"},{"author_name":"Thomas K.
