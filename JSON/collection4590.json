Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain accurate estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. These state estimates require a measurement of the recovered population, and are tolerant to low errors in that measurement. Further, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 112 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. The estimation of this transmission rate is sensitive to contamination in the data, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. Finally, we employ the procedure using real data from Italy reported by Johns Hopkins. The aim of this paper is not to assign extreme significance to the results of these specific experiments \\textit{per se}. Rather, we intend to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown model parameters to a desired precision - all set within the complex context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eve Armstrong","author_inst":"New York Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Manuela Runge","author_inst":"Northwestern University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114819","rel_title":"Distinctive trajectories of COVID-19 epidemic by age and gender: a retrospective modeling of the epidemic in South Korea","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114819","rel_abs":"Objectives: Elderly people had suffered disproportional burden of COVID-19. We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories. Methods: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were fitted with generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored with interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender. Results: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. Interaction between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), but not with gender group. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the society with two peaks: one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was trailing behind that of younger people with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults. Conclusions: Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic in the whole society with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from virus infection after the peak of epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhua Yu","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Jiasong Duan","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Yu Jiang","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Hongmei Zhang","author_inst":"University of Memphis"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114728","rel_title":"Lessons from movement ecology for the return to work: modeling contacts and the spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114728","rel_abs":"Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role in the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and recent lockdown measures aim to localize movement and contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce relative risk of pathogen spread. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional insights to be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allison K Shaw","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Lauren A White","author_inst":"University of Maryland College Park"},{"author_name":"Matthew Michalska-Smith","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth T Borer","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Meggan E Craft","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Eric W Seabloom","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Emilie Snell-Rood","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Travisano","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113258","rel_title":"Belief in Conspiracy Theory about COVID-19 Predicts Mental Health and Well-being -- A Study of Healthcare Staff in Ecuador","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113258","rel_abs":"Abstract Objective: We aim to provide the first evidence of belief in conspiracy theory regarding the COVID-19 virus as a predictor of the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers. Methods: We conducted a survey of 252 healthcare workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. Results: In Ecuador, 32.54% of the sampled healthcare workers experienced distress disorder, and 28.17% had anxiety disorder. Compared to healthcare workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab reported higher levels of distress and anxiety, and lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Older healthcare workers and those who exercise more reported higher job satisfaction. Married healthcare workers, those who exercise more, and those not infected reported higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: This paper identifies belief in a COVID-19 conspiracy theory as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction of healthcare workers. It enables mental health services to better target and help mentally vulnerable healthcare workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Stephen X.

The benefit-risk balance for use of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis, therefore a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is likely to contain limited information, it is required due to the urgent unmet public need. Importantly it allows additional data to be incorporated as it becomes available, and re-evaluation of the benefit-risk profile. Methods: A systematic benefit-risk assessment was conducted using the Benefit-Risk Action team (BRAT) framework. The exposure of interest was lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and EmBase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting clinical outcomes. Two clinicians constructed a value tree and ranked key benefits and risks in order of considered clinical importance. Results: In comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks were identified for lopinavir-ritonavir. Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different for lopinavir-ritonavir in comparison to standard of care (HR=1.31, 95% CI:0.95, 1.80). There appeared to be fewer serious adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir (20%) vs standard of care (32%). In particular, there were fewer cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care (13% vs 27%). Limited data were available for comparison of lopinavir-ritonavir to other treatments. Conclusions: Based on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for use of lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease in serious adverse events, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, the benefit-risk profile for lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 cannot be considered positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become available.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vicki Osborne","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Miranda Davies","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Samantha Lane","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Alison Evans","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Denyer","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Dhanda","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Debabrata Roy","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Saad AW Shakir","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20113951","rel_title":"Knowledge, attitude, and perceptions towards the 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic: A bi-national survey in Africa","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20113951","rel_abs":"The current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed and impacted lives on a global scale since its emergence and spread from China in late 2019.

However, the control of this pandemic still remains unachievable in many African countries including Egypt and Nigeria, despite the application of some strict preventive and control measures. Therefore, this study assessed the knowledge, attitude and perceptions of Egyptians and Nigerians towards COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1437 respondents were included in this preliminary cross-sectional survey. The mean knowledge score was 14.7 plusmn 2.3. The majority of the respondents (61.6%) had a satisfactory knowledge of the disease. Age (18-39 years), education (College\/bachelors) and background of respondents were factors influencing knowledge levels. The attitude of most respondents (68.9%) towards the preventive measures was satisfactory with an average attitude score of 6.9 plusmn 1.2. The majority of the respondents (96%) practiced self-isolation and social-distancing but only 36% follow all health recommendations. The perception of most respondents (62.1%) on the global efforts at controlling the virus and preventing further spread was satisfactory with an average score of 10.9 plusmn 2.7.

Since, there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 disease much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the acceptancy of COVID-19 vaccine and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia. Methods A web-based cross-sectional study was designed using snowball sampling strategies under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and send to 1000 study participants through social media platforms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Associations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic profile of the respondents were explored using the chi-squared test. Key determinants in predicting vaccine acceptancy among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 1000 survey invitees 992 responded to the survey. The majority of the study participants (29.53%) were in the age group (36 to 45 years) and 65.8% were female and 17.9% were Non-Saudi participants. Of the 992 respondents 642 said they are interested in taking the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. Willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups (79.2% among 45+ year old), married participants (69.3%), participants with education levels of a postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), workings with government sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21), and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p < .05). Besides, people having trust in the health system were most likely to accept vaccination (aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13-4.92).Participants having a higher perceived risk of acquiring infection were 2.13 times higher odds of reporting their intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.35-3.85). Conclusion Addressing sociodemographic determinants relating to the COVID-19 vaccination may help to increase uptake of the global vaccination program to tackle future pandemics. Targeted health education measures are needed among the general population to increase the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bijaya Kumar Padhi","author_inst":"Department of Community Medicine & School of Public Health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Mohammed A.

Shortages in staff, operating theatre space and intensive care beds has led to a significant reduction in the provision of surgical care. Even vascular surgery, often insulated from resource scarcity due to its status as an urgent specialty, has limited capacity due to the pandemic. Furthermore, many vascular surgical patients are elderly with multiple comorbidities putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact on patients presenting to vascular surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Analysis: The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has been designed to investigate the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery, at both service provision and individual patient level. COVER is running as a collaborative study through the Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) with the support of numerous national (Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, British Society of Endovascular Therapy, British Society of Interventional Radiology, Rouleaux Club) and an evolving number of international organisations (Vascupedia, SingVasc, Audible Bleeding (USA), Australian and New Zealand Vascular Trials Network (ANZVTN)). The study has 3 Tiers: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular surgeons to capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their hospital; Tier 2 captures data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture any deviations to patient management strategies from pre-pandemic best practice. Data submission and collection will be electronic using online survey tools (Tier 1: SurveyMonkey for service provision data) and encrypted data capture forms (Tiers 2 and 3: REDCap for patient level data). Tier 1 data will undergo real-time serial analysis to determine longitudinal changes in practice, with country-specific analyses also performed. The analysis of Tier 2 and Tier 3 data will occur on completion of the study as per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. Ethical Approval: Ethical approval from the UK Health Research Authority has been obtained for Tiers 2 and 3 (20\/NW\/0196 Liverpool Central). Participating centres in the UK will be required to seek local research and development approval. Non-UK centres will need to obtain a research ethics committee or institutional review board approvals in accordance with national and\/or local requirements.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th, 2020. Setting: This is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S. Participants: The study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal\/oropharyngeal PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exposures: Multiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy. Main Outcomes and Measure: Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and\/or death. Results: For the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16\/40(40%) were male, and 21\/40(52.5%) were African American. 19\/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15\/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6\/40(15%) had severe courses.

In different zip codes in New York City, the epicentre of the epidemic, the number of cases per 100,000 residents has ranged from 437 to 4227, a 1:10 ratio. To guide policy decisions regarding containment and reopening of the economy, schools, and other institutions, it is vital to identify the factors that drive this large variation. This paper reports on a statistical study of incidence variation by zip code across New York City. Among many socio-economic and demographic measures considered, the average household size emerges as the single most important explanatory variable: an increase in average household size by one member increases the zip code incidence rate, in our final model specification, by at least 876 cases, 23% of the range of incidence rates, at a 95% confidence level. The percentage of the population above the age of 65, the percentage below the poverty line, and their interaction term are also strongly positively associated with zip code incidence rates, In terms of ethnic\/racial characteristics, the percentages of African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians within the population, are significantly associated, but the magnitude of the impact is considerably smaller. (The proportion of Asians within a zip code has a negative association.) These significant associations may be explained by comorbidities, known to be more (less) prevalent among the black and Hispanic (Asian) population segments. In turn, the increased prevalence of these comorbidities among the black and Hispanic population, is, in large part, the result of poorer dietary habits and more limited access to healthcare, themselves driven by lower incomes Contrary to popular belief, population density, per se, does not have a significantly positive impact. Indeed, population density and zip code incidence rates are negatively correlated, with a -33% correlation coefficient. Our model specification is based on a well-established epidemiologic model that explains the effects of household sizes on R0, the basic reproductive number of an epidemic. Our findings support implemented and proposed policies to quarantine pre-acute and post-acute patients, as well as nursing home admission policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Awi Federgruen","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sherin R Naha","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Estelle Chaix","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Anne Thebault","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pavio","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Sophie Le Poder","author_inst":"ENVA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Batejat","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Biot","author_inst":"IRBA"},{"author_name":"Lionel Koch","author_inst":"IRBA"},{"author_name":"Don Schaffner","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Moez Sanaa","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Adil Javed","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Lisak","author_inst":"Detroit Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mirela Cerghet","author_inst":"MCERGHE1@hfhs.org"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114652","rel_title":"A SARS-CoV-2 serological assay to determine the presence of blocking antibodies that compete for human ACE2 binding","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114652","rel_abs":"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread around the world, there is an urgent need for new assay formats to characterize the humoral response to infection. Convalescent serum is being used for treatment and for isolation of patient-derived antibodies. However, currently there is not a simple means to estimate serum bulk neutralizing capability. Here we present an efficient competitive serological assay that can simultaneously determine an individual's seropositivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and estimate the neutralizing capacity of anti-Spike antibodies to block interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. In this ELISA-based assay, we present natively-folded viral Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then supplemented with soluble ACE2-Fc to compete for RBD-binding serum antibodies, and antibody binding quantified. Comparison of signal from untreated serum and ACE2-Fc-treated serum reveals the presence of antibodies that compete with ACE2 for RBD binding, as evidenced by loss of signal with ACE2-Fc treatment. In our test cohort of nine convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, we found all patients had developed anti-RBD antibodies targeting the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement. This assay provides a simple and high-throughput method to screen patient sera for potentially neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies to enable identification of candidate sera for therapeutic use.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James R.

Our aim was to compare the sensitivity of two testing metrics--population testing number and testing coverage--to population mortality outcomes and identify a benchmark for testing adequacy with respect to population mortality and capture of potential disease burden. This ecological study aggregated publicly available data through April 12 on testing and outcomes related to COVID-19 across 36 OECD (Organization for Economic Development) countries and Taiwan. All OECD countries and Taiwan were included in this population-based study as a proxy for countries with highly developed economic and healthcare infrastructure. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the aforementioned metrics and following outcome measures: deaths per 1 million people, case fatality rate, and case proportion of critical illness. Fractional polynomials were used to generate scatter plots to model the relationship between the testing metrics and outcomes. Testing coverage, but not population testing number, was highly correlated with population mortality (rs= -0.79, P=5.975e-09 vs rs =- 0.3, P=0.05) and case fatality rate (rs= -0.67, P=9.067e-06 vs rs = -0.21, P=0.20). A testing coverage threshold of 15-45 signified adequate testing: below 15, testing coverage was associated with exponentially increasing population mortality, whereas above 45, increased testing did not yield significant incremental mortality benefit. Testing coverage was better than population testing number in explaining country performance and can be used as an early and sensitive indicator of testing adequacy and disease burden. This may be particularly useful as countries consider re-opening their economies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Chien-Chang Lee","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tzu-Chun Hsu","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ting Hsu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Chang-Chuan Chan","author_inst":"College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Shyr-Chyr Chen","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Jen Chen","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Charles Y.

In contrast to a standard SIR model, we find that the incidence of COVID-19 spread is concave in the number of contagious individuals, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. This concave shape has a significant impact on forecasted COVID-19 cases. In particular, our model forecasts that the number of COVID cases would only have an exponential growth for a brief period at the beginning of the contagion event or right after a reopening, but would quickly settle into a prolonged period of time with stable, slightly declining levels of disease spread. This pattern is consistent with observed levels of COVID-19 cases in the US, but inconsistent with standard SIR modeling. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng Liu","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Raphael Thomadsen","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Song Yao","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ting Hsu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Chang-Chuan Chan","author_inst":"College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Shyr-Chyr Chen","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Jen Chen","author_inst":"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Charles Y.

METHODS We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and\/or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer [&ge;]1:160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2\/FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. RESULTS The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, 30 on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2\/FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days. The upper one-sided 90%CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2\/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95%CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95%CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively. Weaning from CPAP was obtained in 26\/30 patients and 3\/7 were extubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2 likely, 2 possible treatment related). CONCLUSIONS Hyperimmune plasma in Covid-19 shows promising benefits, to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. This proof of concept study could open to future developments including hyperimmune plasma banking, development of standardized pharmaceutical products and monoclonal antibodies.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesare Perotti","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Fausto Baldanti","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Bruno","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Delfante","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Elena Seminari","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Casari","author_inst":"Calo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Elena Percivalle","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Glingani","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Valeria Musella","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Mirko Belliato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Martina Garuti","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Marilena Frigato","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Antonio Di Sabatino","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Catherine Klersy","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinco San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Donno","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Massimo Franchini","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113167","rel_title":"A pilot study to investigate the fecal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 virus genome in COVID-19 patients in Odisha, India","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113167","rel_abs":"In infectious diseases, the routes of transmission play major roles in determining the rate and extent of disease spread.

We report our findings regarding the duration of viral RNA positivity among a cohort of young patients with mild disease. Between March 20th, 2020, and May 10th, 2020, 219 soldiers were admitted to the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps (IDF-MC) COVID-19 rehabilitation center following a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. 119 of these patients, 84 (70.6%) males, 35 (29.4%) females with a median age of 21 (IQR 19-25) were classified as having mild disease and had two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests by May 10th, 2020. The median time for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in the study population was 21 days (IQR 15-27) from symptom onset, with a range of 4 to 45 days. The results of this study suggest that in young and healthy adult patients with COVID-19, the median duration of viral positivity is around three weeks.

Objective: To determine the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all HCW. Methods. Cross-sectional study (April 14th- 27th , 2020) of all HCW at Hospital Universitario Fundacion Alcorcon, a second level teaching hospital in Madrid, Spain. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured by ELISA. HCW were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Results: Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (90.5%) were evaluated. Mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1) and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive, with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Among them, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high (33.1%) and medium (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p=0.007), but no difference was found for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p=NS). HCW with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, seropositivity was associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), or nurse- assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27) Conclusions: Seroprevalence uncovered a high rate of infection previously unnoticed among HCW.

Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Denmark is currently opening up after a lockdown in mid-March.Methods We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries.Result Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark and in at least one case find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes is stable after lockdown.Conclusion Our work shows how genetic data can be used to identify routes of introduction of a virus into a region and provide alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission chains suggesting that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted; thus challenging the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality. Our methods can be applied to other countries, regions or even highly localised outbreaks. When used in real-time, we believe they can serve to identify transmission events and supplement traditional methods such as contact tracing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andreas Bluhm","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Matthias Christandl","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Fulvio Gesmundo","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Frederik Ravn Klausen","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Laura Mancinska","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Vincent Steffan","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stilck Franca","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Albert Werner","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"- Working Group Alcorcon COVID-19 investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mirko Belliato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Martina Garuti","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Marilena Frigato","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Antonio Di Sabatino","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Catherine Klersy","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinco San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Donno","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Massimo Franchini","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.122366","rel_title":"Evidence of significant natural selection in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, not humans","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.122366","rel_abs":"RNA viruses are proficient at switching host species, and evolving adaptations to exploit the new hosts cells efficiently.

Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting on the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in ancestral hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor [~]1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. Collectively our results demonstrate the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of near immediate human-human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oscar A MacLean","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Spyros Lytras","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Steven Weaver","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Joshua B Singer","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Maciej F Boni","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lemey","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Sergei L Kosakovsky Pond","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"David L Robertson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"- Working Group Alcorcon COVID-19 investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mirko Belliato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia"},{"author_name":"Martina Garuti","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Marilena Frigato","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Antonio Di Sabatino","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico SanMatteo, Pavia & University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Catherine Klersy","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinco San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Donno","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"},{"author_name":"Massimo Franchini","author_inst":"Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.122291","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces EMT-like molecular changes, including ZEB1-mediated repression of the viral receptor ACE2, in lung cancer models","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.122291","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which enters host cells via the cell surface proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Using normal and malignant models and tissues from the aerodigestive and respiratory tracts, we investigated the expression and regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We find that ACE2 expression is restricted to a select population of highly epithelial cells and is repressed by ZEB1, in concert with ZEB1s established role in promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, infection of lung cancer cells with SARS-CoV-2 induces metabolic and transcriptional changes consistent with EMT, including upregulation of ZEB1 and AXL, thereby downregulating ACE2 post-infection. This suggests a novel model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in which infected cells shift toward an increasingly mesenchymal state and lose ACE2 expression, along with its acute respiratory distress syndrome-protective effect, in a ZEB1-dependent manner. AXL-inhibition and ZEB1-reduction, as with bemcentinib, offers a potential strategy to reverse this effect.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"C.

We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group consisting of people that are enforced\/recommended to stay at home. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of R0 and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more lives can be saved. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Soledad Aronna","author_inst":"FGV\/EMAp"},{"author_name":"Roberto Guglielmi","author_inst":"FGV\/EMAp"},{"author_name":"Lucas Machado Moschen","author_inst":"FGV\/EMAp"},{"author_name":"Zhesheng He","author_inst":"Institute of High Energy Physcis"},{"author_name":"Xingfa Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Wenchao Niu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M.

Countries are being gradually exposed to its devastating threat without being properly prepared and with inadequate response. COVID 19 first two cases were reported in Pakistan on February 26, 2020. We present a model depicting progression of epidemiology curve for Pakistan with and without interventions in view of its health system response capacity in near future. Methodology We used a modified compartmental epidemiological SEIR model to describe the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan including the possibility of asymptomatic infection and presymptomatic transmission. The behavior of the dynamic model is determined by a set of clinical parameters and transmission rate. Results We estimated that in the absence of a set of proven interventions, the total susceptible population would be 43.24 million, exposed individuals would be almost 32 million, asymptomatic cases would be 13.13 million, mildly infected 30.64 million, severely infected slightly more than 6 million and critical cases would be around 967,000 in number. By that time, almost 760,000 fatalities of infected critical would have taken place. Comparing with the healthcare capacity of Pakistan, if we could flatten the curve to a level below the dashed grey line, the healthcare system will be capable of managing the cases with ideal healthcare facilities, where the grey line representing the healthcare capacity of Pakistan. With the intervention in place, the number of symptomatic infected individuals is expected to be almost 20 million. Conclusion We consider the impact of intervention and control measures on the spread of COVID-19 with 30% reduction in transmission from mild cases in case a set of interventions are judiciously in place to mitigate its impact.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ejaz Ahmad Khan","author_inst":"Health Services Academy, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maida Umar","author_inst":"United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maryam Khalid","author_inst":"Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zhesheng He","author_inst":"Institute of High Energy Physcis"},{"author_name":"Xingfa Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Gao","author_inst":"Jiangxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Wenchao Niu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M.
