To appropriately design policies and anticipate behavioral change, it is important to understand how different Americans' social distancing behavior shifts in relation to policy announcements according to individual characteristics, and community vulnerability. Methods: This cross-sectional study used Unacast's social distancing data from February 24th - May 10th, 2020 to study how social distancing changed before and after: 1) The World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic, 2) White House announcement of \"Opening Up America Again\" (OUAA) guidelines, and 3) the week of April 27 when several states reopened. To measure intention to social distance, we assessed the difference between weekday and weekend behavior as more individuals have more control over weekend leisure time. To investigate social distancing's sensitivity to different population characteristics, we compared social distancing time-series data across county vulnerability as measured by the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) which defines vulnerability across socioeconomic, household composition, minority status, epidemiological, and healthcare-system related factors. We also compared social distancing across population groupings by race, 2016 presidential election voting choice, and employment sectors. Results: Movement reduced significantly throughout March reaching peak reduction on April 12th (-56.1%) prior the enactment of any reopening policies. Shifts in social distancing began after major announcements but prior to specific applied policies: Following the WHO declaration, national social distancing significantly increased on weekdays and weekends (-18.6% and -41.3% decline in mobility, respectively). Social distancing significantly declined on weekdays and weekends after OUAA guidelines (i.e. before state reopening) (+1.1% and +5.3% increase in mobility, respectively) with additional significant decline after state reopening (+10.0% and +20.9% increase in mobility, respectively). Social distancing was significantly greater on weekends than weekdays throughout March, however, the trend reversed by early May with significantly less social distancing on weekends, suggesting a shift in intent to social distance during leisure time. In general, vulnerable counties social distanced less than non-vulnerable counties, and had a greater difference between weekday and weekend behavior until state reopening. This may be driven by structural barriers that vulnerable communities face, such as higher rates of employment in particular sectors. At all time periods studied, the average black individual in the US social distanced significantly more than the average white individual, and the average 2016 Clinton voter social distanced significantly more than the average 2016 Trump voter. Social distancing behavior differed across industries with three clusters of employment sectors. Conclusion: Both signaling of a policy change and implementation of a policy are important factors that seem to influence social distancing. Behaviors shifted with national announcements prior to mandates, though social distancing further declined nationwide as the first states reopened. The variation in behavioral drivers including vulnerability, race, political affiliation, and employment industry demonstrates the need for targeted policy messaging and interventions tailored to address specific barriers for improved social distancing and mitigation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vincent S Huang","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Staci Sutermaster","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Yael Caplan","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kemp","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Danielle Schmutz","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Sema K Sgaier","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20116624","rel_title":"Associations between COVID-19 infection, tobacco smoking and nicotine use, common respiratory conditions and inhaled corticosteroids: a prospective QResearch-Case Mix Programme data linkage study January-May 2020","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20116624","rel_abs":"Introduction Epidemiological and laboratory research seems to suggest that smoking and perhaps nicotine alone could reduce the severity of COVID-19. Likewise, there is some evidence that inhaled corticosteroids could also reduce its severity, opening the possibility that nicotine and inhaled steroids could be used as treatments. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we will link English general practice records from the QResearch database to Public Health England's database of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests, Hospital Episode Statistics, admission to intensive care units, and death from COVID-19 to identify our outcomes: hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death due to COVID. Using Cox regression, we will perform sequential adjustment for potential confounders identified by separate directed acyclic graphs to: 1. Assess the association between smoking and COVID-19 disease severity, and how that changes on adjustment for smoking-related comorbidity. 2. More closely characterise the association between smoking and severe COVID-19 disease by assessing whether the association is modified by age (as a proxy of length of smoking), gender, ethnic group, and whether people have asthma or COPD. 3. Assess for evidence of a dose-response relation between smoking intensity and disease severity, which would help create a case for causality. 4. Examine the association between former smokers who are using NRT or are vaping and disease severity. 5. Examine whether pre-existing respiratory disease is associated with severe COVID-19 infection. 6. Assess whether the association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma and COVID-19 disease severity is modified by age, gender, ethnicity, and smoking status. 7. Assess whether the use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with severity of COVID-19 disease. 8. To assess whether the association between use of inhaled corticosteroids and severity of COVID-19 disease is modified by the number of other airways medications used (as a proxy for severity of condition) and whether people have asthma or COPD. Conclusions This representative population sample will, to our knowledge, present the first comprehensive examination of the association between smoking, nicotine use without smoking, respiratory disease, and severity of COVID-19. We will undertake several sensitivity analyses to examine the potential for bias in these associations.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Aveyard","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicola Lindson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Min Gao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hartmann-Boyce","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Margaret Smith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Duncan Young","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Coupland","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Pui San Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ashley K Clift","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Harrison","author_inst":"Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (icnarc)"},{"author_name":"Doug W Gould","author_inst":"Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (icnarc)"},{"author_name":"Ian Pavord","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Watkinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Julia Hippisley-Cox","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20107011","rel_title":"A COVID-19 outbreak in a rheumatology department upon the early days of the pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20107011","rel_abs":"Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department, early in the pandemic. Methods: Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Results: 14\/34 HCWs (41%; 40{+\/-}14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11\/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnoea before testing, which were absent in 3\/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28{+\/-}18 days), viral shedding (31{+\/-}10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51) and work absence (29{+\/-}28 days) were prolonged. 13\/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response, with higher IgG-index in individuals over 50 years (14.5{+\/-}7.7 vs 5.0{+\/-}4.4, p=0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1\/8 hospitalisation, 8\/8 complete recovery), following a consultation\/procedure with an asymptomatic (7\/8) or mildly-symptomatic (1\/8) HCW. Conclusions: A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognised, and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasco C.

This paper proposes a critical review of the state of the art regarding studies on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and sewage sludge, the factors affecting its inactivation and the main proposed treatments, with the aim to provide useful information at operative level in order to better and safer manage wastewater and sewage sludge. Given the lack of literature on SARS-CoV-2, studies involving other HCoVs such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E have been also considered. In wastewater, the resistance of SARS-CoV has proven to be very limited, especially at temperatures above 20 {degrees}C, and the virus has been easily removed with the use of chlorine (> 0.5 mg L-1 for 30 min). For sewage sludge, based on in vitro experiments, it is suggested to increase the retention times before a possible reuse in agriculture only for precautionary purposes, since SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to occur in the sludge. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater might track the epidemic trends: although being extremely promising, an effective and wide application of this approach requires a deeper knowledge of the amounts of viruses excreted through the faeces and the actual detectability of viral RNA in sewage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Collivignarelli","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Carlo Collivignarelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marco Carnevale Miino","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Abb&agrave","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberta Pedrazzani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Bertanza","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Lu\u00eds Galaio","author_inst":"Occupational Health Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Helena Proen\u00e7a","author_inst":"Clinical Pathology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Melo Cristino","author_inst":"Clinical Pathology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Ema Sacadura-Leite","author_inst":"Occupational Health Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Nikita Khmelinskii","author_inst":"Rheumatology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte; Rheumatology Research Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Fac"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Carlos Romeu","author_inst":"Rheumatology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o Eurico Fonseca","author_inst":"Rheumatology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte; Rheumatology Research Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Fac"},{"author_name":"- CHULN Rheumatology Department","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20122549","rel_title":"Policy Implications of an Approximate Linear Infection Model for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20122549","rel_abs":"We propose a linear model of infection probability, and prove that this is a good approximation to a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks.

Methods: We evaluated patients treated with tocilizumab for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between 3\/13\/20 and 4\/16\/20. This was a multi-center study with data collected by chart review both retrospectively and concurrently. Parameters evaluated included age, sex, race, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), usage of steroids and vasopressors, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. In the absence of mechanical ventilation, the timing of the dose was related to the patient's date of admission only. Results: We evaluated 145 patients. The average age was 58.1 years, 64% were male, 68.3% had comorbidities, and 60% received steroid therapy. Disposition of patients was 48.3% discharged and 29.3% expired, of which 43.9% were African American. Mechanical ventilation was required in 55.9%, of which 34.5% expired. Avoidance of MV (p value = 0.002) and increased survival (p value < 0.001) was statistically associated with early dosing.

Analyzing the effect of lockdown on the infection may give us a better insight into the evolution of epidemic while implementing the quarantine procedures as well as improving the healthcare facilities. For accurate modelling, incorporating various parameters along with sophisticated computational facilities, are required. Parallel to SIRD modelling, we tend to compare it with the Ising model and derive a quantum circuit that incorporates the rate of infection and rate of recovery, etc as its parameters.

Now a prominent unnoticed sub-weekly cycle (SWC) of 3.5 days is uncovered in the long-term epidemiological records of Kawasaki disease (KD) in Japan, a mysterious vasculitis of yet unknown origin. After ruling out the effect of reporting biases, the analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) atmospheric profiles further confirms that this variability is linked to atmospheric particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 1 micron. SWC accounts for 20% of the variance in KD and its contribution is stable throughout the entire epidemiological record dating back to 1970, both at the prefecture level and for entire Japan. KD maxima in 2010-2016 always occur in full synchrony with LIDAR particle arrival in diverse locations such as Tokyo, Toyama and Tsukuba as well as for the entire of Japan. Rapid intrusion of aerosols from heights up to 6km to the surface is observed with KD admissions co-varying with their metal chemical composition. While regional intensity of winds has not changed in the interval 1979-2015, our study instead points for the first time to increased anthropogenic pollution as a necessary co-factor in the occurrence of KD and sets the field to associate other similar human vasculitis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Albert Navarro Gallinad","author_inst":"ADAPT Centre, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Tomoko Kojima","author_inst":"Faculty of Advanced Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"},{"author_name":"Joan Ballester","author_inst":"ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Silvia Borras","author_inst":"Climate and Health (CLIMA) Program, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Prasanta Kumar Panigrahi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Michael Anderson","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Melina Diaz","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kairav Shah","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Chundi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Hines","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Harting","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20122416","rel_title":"Drug-Drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics drugs: integrated evidence from 4 databases and a systematic review","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20122416","rel_abs":"Relevance: Management of symptoms like anxiety, delirium and agitation cannot be neglected in COVID-19 patients. Antipsychotics are usually used for the pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral disturbances. The selection of concomitant COVID-19 medications and antipsychotics should be evidence-based and closely monitored Objective: To systematically review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics. Evidence Review: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and TdP, the CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was searched. Based on the information collected, the authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to find the clinical outcomes of drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics Results: The main interaction between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT prolongation and TdP, and CYP interactions. Remdesivir, favipiravir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics with no risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics, although it can restore the activity of CYP3A4 and therefore its substrate metabolism may increase. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for co-administration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin (all prolong QT interval) and lopinavir \/ ritonavir (CYP interaction and risk of QT prolongation). Conclusions: We urge to development of evidence-based guidelines that can help clinicians decide the safest treatment combination and monitoring necessary for each particular patient. The selection of concomitant COVID-19 medications and antipsychotics should be evidence-based and closely monitored.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beatriz Oda Plasencia-Garcia","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Rodriguez-Menendez","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Isabel Rico-Rangel","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Rubio-Garcia","author_inst":"Psychiatry Department, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jaime Torello-Iserte","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Benedicto Crespo-Facorro","author_inst":"Head and Chair of the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, IBIS, CIBERSAM, University of Sevilla, Spain."},{"author_name":"Michael Anderson","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Melina Diaz","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kairav Shah","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Chundi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Hines","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Harting","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20124180","rel_title":"COVID 19 Pandemic: A Real-time Forecasts & Prediction of Confirmed Cases, Active Cases using the ARIMA model &Public Health in West Bengal, India.","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20124180","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 2020. This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. As economic burden makes it increasingly difficult for our country to continue imposing control measures, it is vital for states like West Bengal to make predictions using time series forecasting for the upcoming cases , test kits , health care and estimated the requirement of Quarantine centers, isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients . Objective: This study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until August, using time series ARIMA model & Public Health in West Bengal, India. Methods: We used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the end of August month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal, India from March 1, 2020, to June 4, 2020. Discussion and Conclusion: This forecasts show a very crucial situation for West Bengal in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed case as Lockdown 5.0 & Unlock 1.0 will be implemented from 1st June 2020 in India, West Bengal will be observing a partial lift of the lockdown and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of Health care sector needs to be further improved isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be needed to increase in that scenario. Inter State & Intra State Movement restrictions are lifted. Hence, Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest more of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system, which will directly or indirectly affect the States in the time of crisis.

Although many models have been developed all around the world, transparent models that allow interacting with the assumptions will become more important as we test various strategies for lockdown, testing and social interventions and enable effective policy decisions. In this paper, we developed a suite of models to guide the development of policies under different scenarios when the lockdown opens. These had been deployed to create an interactive dashboard called COVision which includes the Agent-based Models (ABM) and classical compartmental models (CCM). Our tool allows simulation of scenarios by changing the strength of lockdown, basic reproduction number(R0), asymptomatic spread, testing rate, contact rate, recovery rate, incubation period, leakage in lockdown etc. We optimized ABM and CCMs and evaluated them on multiple error metrics. Out of these models in our suite, ABM was able to capture the data better than CCMs. Our evaluation suggests that ABM models were able to capture the dynamic nature of the epidemic for a longer duration of time while CCMs performed inefficiently. We computed R0 using CCMs which were found to be decreasing with lockdown duration, indicating the effectiveness of policies in different states of India. Models have been deployed on a dashboard hosted at http:\/\/covision.tavlab.iiitd.edu.in which allows users to simulate outcomes under different parameters and will allow the policymakers to make informed decisions and efficient monitoring of the covid19 pandemic in India.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya Nagori","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of genomics and integrative biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vineet Joshi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Suryatej Reddy Vyalla","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Akhil Jarodia","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chandan Gupta","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amogh Gulati","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Harsh Bandhey","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Keerat Kaur Guliani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Mehrab Singh Gill","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20123505","rel_title":"Knowledge and Awareness-based Survey of COVID-19 within the Eye Care Profession in Nepal: Misinformation is Hiding the Truth.","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20123505","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Nepal is currently under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic with misinformation circulating on social media.

We modelled the effects of enforced inactivity on diabetes burden using published evidence. Methods: Using Health Survey for England data, we estimated the prevalence of pre-diabetes and physical activity in adults aged 70 and older. The number of new diabetes cases directly attributed to lockdown were calculated using population attributable risk. Unit cost estimates of the additional burden on primary care and the cost of complications to secondary care were taken from the literature. Results: From 9 million older (aged 70yrs and above) people living in England, 2.1 million could be defined as pre-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin > 42 < 48 mmol\/mol). The estimated population attributable fraction (0.281) (assuming relative risk of diabetes from inactivity, 3.3; 40% physically active pre-lockdown) would give rise to 392,948 new cases of diabetes which we argue are directly attributed to a prolonged period of lockdown. We estimate that the cost of screening and testing these patients in primary care (GBP 35m), their subsequent treatment and management (GBP 229m), and complications (GBP 909m) would equate to an additional GBP 1.17bn to the health care system. Conclusions: Inactivity related to lockdown in previously active older adults may contribute up to GBP 1.17b in additional healthcare costs through a potential increase in diabetes. Clear advice about the importance of physical activity may reduce this potential economic burden during global pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Kipps","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mark Hamer","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paula Lorgelly","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Akhil Jarodia","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chandan Gupta","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amogh Gulati","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Harsh Bandhey","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Keerat Kaur Guliani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Mehrab Singh Gill","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120832","rel_title":"A how-to-guide to building a robust SARS-CoV-2 testing program at a university-based health system","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120832","rel_abs":"When South Florida became a hotspot for COVID-19 disease in March 2020, we faced an urgent need to develop test capability to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The reported results were controversial, so the objective of the present study is to assess the relationship between different blood groups and the onset and mortality of COVID-19 infection using meta-analysis method. Methods: We searched the databases using appropriate MeSH terms. We screened articles on the basis of titles, abstracts, and full texts and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Quality assessment was done with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist. The estimated frequency of COVID-19 infection and death in terms of ABO blood group and the overall estimate of the odd ratio between blood group with COVID-19 infection and death was done with 95% confidence interval. Results: The pooled frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among COVID-19 infected individuals was estimated as 36.22%, 24.99%, 29.67%, and 9.29% respectively. The frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among the dead cases due to COVID-19 infection was estimated as 40%, 23%, 29%, and 8% respectively. The odd ratio of COVID-19 infection for blood group A versus the other blood groups was estimated 1.16 (CI 95%: 1.02-1.33). The corresponding figures for blood groups O and AB versus other blood groups were estimated as 0.73 (CI 95%: 0.60-0.88) and 1.25(CI 95%: 0.84-1.86) respectively. Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that individuals with blood group A are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection while those with blood group O are at lower risk. Although the odds ratio of death for AB blood group was non-significant, it was considerable.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fateme Pourali","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Afshari","author_inst":"Zabol University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Javad Javidnia","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Moosazadeh","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lazara Pagan","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lauren Gjolaj","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jessica MacIntyre","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Triana","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Barbara Vance","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"David Andrews","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yao-Shan Fan","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Octavio Martinez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica Garcia-Buitrago","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Cray","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Tekin","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, John P.

Methods Saliva samples from 103 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (15 asymptomatic and 88 symptomatic) were collected on the day of hospital admission. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva was detected using a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) laboratory-developed test (LDT), a cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, three direct RT-qPCR kits, and reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Viral antigen was detected by a rapid antigen immunochromatographic assay. Results Of the 103 samples, viral RNA was detected in 50.5-81.6% of the specimens by molecular diagnostic tests and an antigen was detected in 11.7% of the specimens by the rapid antigen test. Viral RNA was detected at a significantly higher percentage (65.6-93.4%) in specimens collected within 9 d of symptom onset compared to that of specimens collected after at least 10 d of symptom onset (22.2-66.7%) and that of asymptomatic patients (40.0-66.7%). Viral RNA was more frequently detected in saliva from males than females. Conclusions Self-collected saliva is an alternative specimen diagnosing COVID-19. LDT RT-qPCR, cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, direct RT-qPCR except for one commercial kit, and RT-LAMP showed sufficient sensitivity in clinical use to be selectively used according to clinical settings and facilities. The rapid antigen test alone is not recommended for initial COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low sensitivity.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayu Ikeda","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuo Imai","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Tabata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tsukasa Mizuno","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nami Murahara","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Midori Horiuchi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kento Kato","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yoshitaka Imoto","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maki Iwata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Mimura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Kato","author_inst":"International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital"},{"author_name":"Octavio Martinez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica Garcia-Buitrago","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Cray","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Tekin","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, John P.

Evidence recommends that vitamin D might be an important supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in cytokine response regulation against COVID-19. Hence, we carried out a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis along with an ecological investigation in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar (intitle) as well as preprint database of medRxiv, bioRxiv, Research Square, preprints.org, search engine of ScienceDirect and a rapid search through famous journals up to August 4, 2020. Studies focused on the role of vitamin D in confirmed COVID-19 patients were entered into the systematic review. Along with our main aim, to find the second objective correlation of global vitamin D status and COVID-19 recovery and mortality we carried out a literature search in PubMed database to identify the national or regional studies reported the vitamin D status globally. CMA v. 2.2.064 and SPSS v.16 were used for data analysis. Results: Eleven studies containing 360,972 participants entered into the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis indicated that 37.7% of COVID-19 patients were suffering from vitamin D deficiency (95% CI, 26.7%-50.1%) and in 32.2% of patients, levels of vitamin D were insufficient (95% CI, 13.8%-58.4%). Also, a significant increased risk of COVID-19 was found in individuals with low levels of vitamin D (OR: 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75). In regard to our ecological investigation on 51 countries including 408,748 participants, analyses indicated no correlation between vitamin D levels and recovery rate (r= 0.041) as well as mortality rate (r=-0.073) globally. However, given latitude, a small reverse correlation between mortality rate and vitamin D status was observed throughout the globe (r= -0.177). In Asia, a medium direct correlation was observed for recovery rate (r= 0.317) and a significant reveres correlation for mortality rate (r= -0.700) with vitamin D status in such patients. In Europe, there were no correlations for both recovery (r= 0.040) and mortality rate (r= -0.035). In Middle East, the recovery rate (r= 0.267) and mortality rate (r= -0.217) showed a medium correlation. In North and Sought America, surprisingly, both recovery and mortality rate demonstrated a direct correlation respectively (r= 1.000, r=0.500). In Oceania, unexpectedly, recovery (r= -1.000) and mortality (r= -1.000) rates were in considerable reverse correlation with vitamin D levels. Conclusion: In this systematic review and meta-analysis with an ecological approach, we found a high percentage of COVID-19 patients who suffer from vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency as well as a significant increased risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with low levels of vitamin D. Our ecological investigation resulted in substantial direct and reverse correlations between recovery and mortality rates of COVID-19 patients with vitamin D status in different countries. Considering latitudes, a small reverse correlation between vitamin D status and mortality rate was found globally. It seems that populations with lower levels of vitamin D might be more susceptible to the novel coronavirus infection. Nevertheless, due to multiple limitations, if this study does not allow to quantify a value of the Vitamin D with full confidence, it allows at least to know what the Vitamin D might be and that it would be prudent to invest in this direction through comprehensive large randomized clinical trials.

To date, 89442 confirmed cases have been diagnosed in Lombardy, and mortality in several municipalities has already surpassed that of the past decade. Currently, the true extent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown as several affected subjects may have been asymptomatic or have presented mild disease, thus not resulting in the identified COVID-19 cases. Methods This cross-sectional study aims to define the spread of infection within the population by determining the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid immunochromatographic testing and subsequent confirmation by serology on venous blood by liquid phase immunochemical testing, also allowing to compare the two methods. Testing will be performed on adults and minors residing, domiciled or working in several municipalities of the Lombardy Region, involved in the initial stages of the epidemic. The study will include rapid finger-prick testing and venous sampling for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS). Concurrent notification of test results will occur via the regional healthcare information system (SISS). Discussion This study was developed with the desire to understand the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the epidemiological transmission characteristics of this virus. Understanding the spread and severity of the disease could help in the implementation of effective infection surveillance containment and countermeasures facilitating the identification of cases that have been exposed to the virus and the traceability of contacts.

In this study, a random forest of 9,250 regression trees was applied to 6,941 observations of 13 statistically significant predictor variables targeting SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates per 100,000 across 88 days in 157 countries. One key finding is an algorithm that can predict the incidence rate per day of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic cycle with a pseudo-R2 accuracy of 98.5% and explain 97.4% of the variances. Another key finding is the relative importance of 13 demographic, economic, environmental, and public health modulators to the SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate. Four factors proposed in earlier research as potential modulators have no statistically significant relationship with incidence rates (2)(3). These findings give leaders new capabilities for improved capacity planning and targeting stay-at-home interventions and prioritizing programming by knowing the atypical social determinants that are the root causes of SARS-CoV-2 incidence variance. This work also proves that machine learning can accurately and quickly explain disease dynamics for zoonoses with pandemic potential.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Luellen","author_inst":"Bioinformatix"},{"author_name":"Dario Bernacchia","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Federico Conti","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Rossana Rondanin","author_inst":"Medispa s.r.l."},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie-PSL Research University, CNRS, Sorbonne Universite', UMR3664, F-75005, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Alireza Motamedzadeh","author_inst":"Kashan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Dadgostar","author_inst":"Halal Research Center of IRI"},{"author_name":"Marzieh Aalinezhad","author_inst":"Isfahan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Morteza Behnamfar","author_inst":"North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anahita Asadi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bahman Zarandi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nazanin Razzaghi","author_inst":"Golestan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vahid Yaghoubi Naei","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Azizi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Reza Mohseni","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bilbao","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Silvia Prieto","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maritza Polania","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maritza Suarez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa Lujardo","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gloria Campos","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michele Morris","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bhavarth Shukla","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alberto Caban-Martinez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Erin Kobetz","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dipen Parekh","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Merce Jorda","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20124313","rel_title":"Closed form solution of the SIR model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20124313","rel_abs":"The CODIV-19 outbreak in early 2020 generated a tremendous effort of epidemiologists and researchers to fit the experimental data with the solutions of the SIR model equations or with more sophisticated models.

Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the 'universal' growth of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We validate these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old is importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar growth of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential growth of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beatriz Seoane","author_inst":"Sorbonne University"},{"author_name":"Dario Bernacchia","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Federico Conti","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Rossana Rondanin","author_inst":"Medispa s.r.l."},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie-PSL Research University, CNRS, Sorbonne Universite', UMR3664, F-75005, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Alireza Motamedzadeh","author_inst":"Kashan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Dadgostar","author_inst":"Halal Research Center of IRI"},{"author_name":"Marzieh Aalinezhad","author_inst":"Isfahan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Morteza Behnamfar","author_inst":"North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anahita Asadi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bahman Zarandi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nazanin Razzaghi","author_inst":"Golestan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vahid Yaghoubi Naei","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Azizi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Reza Mohseni","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bilbao","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Silvia Prieto","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maritza Polania","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maritza Suarez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa Lujardo","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gloria Campos","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michele Morris","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bhavarth Shukla","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alberto Caban-Martinez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Erin Kobetz","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dipen Parekh","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Merce Jorda","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20124198","rel_title":"Predictors of Mental Health during the early Covid-19 Pandemic in the US: role of economic concerns, health worries and social distancing","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20124198","rel_abs":"Objective: To assess mental health in the US adult population in the Covid-19 pandemic and explore the roles of economic concerns, health worries and social distancing in shaping mental health outcomes. Methods: We analyze online survey data from the \"Understanding America Study\" (UAS) that is representative of the US adult population and covers the period of March 10-31st 2020 (sample size: 6436). Results: About 29% (CI:27.4-.30.4%) of the US adult population reported some depression\/anxiety symptoms over the study period, with symptoms deteriorating over the month of March. Worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic, while concerns about the potential impact of the virus on respondents' own health and the practice of social distancing also predicted the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms, albeit less strongly. Conclusions: Our findings point towards a major mental health crisis unfolding simultaneously with the pandemic in the US. They also highlight the importance of economic countermeasures and social policy for mitigating the impact of Covid-19 on adult mental health in the US over and above an effective public health response.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrice Kampfen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Iliana V.

We have conducted a study of 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19, including 28 mild and 14 severe cases, comparing their T cell responses to those of 16 control donors. We assessed the immune memory of T cell responses using IFN{gamma} based assays with overlapping peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 apart from ORF1. We found the breadth, magnitude and frequency of memory T cell responses from COVID-19 were significantly higher in severe compared to mild COVID-19 cases, and this effect was most marked in response to spike, membrane, and ORF3a proteins. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with the anti-Spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) as well as anti-Nucleoprotein (NP) endpoint antibody titre (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.002). We identified 39 separate peptides containing CD4+ and\/or CD8+ epitopes, which strikingly included six immunodominant epitope clusters targeted by T cells in many donors, including 3 clusters in spike (recognised by 29%, 24%, 18% donors), two in the membrane protein (M, 32%, 47%) and one in the nucleoprotein (Np, 35%). CD8+ responses were further defined for their HLA restriction, including B*4001-restricted T cells showing central memory and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher frequencies of multi-cytokine producing M- and NP-specific CD8+ T cells than spike-specific CD8+ T cells were observed. They furthermore showed a higher ratio of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ to CD4+ T cell responses. Immunodominant epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this study will provide critical tools to study the role of virus-specific T cells in control and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of T cell specificity and functionality associated with milder disease, highlights the potential importance of including non-spike proteins within future COVID-19 vaccine design.","rel_num_authors":60,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Dong","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Yanchun Peng","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander

COVID-19 patients mount robust T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an important role for T cells in viral clearance. To date, the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells remain poorly defined. Using 38-parameter CyTOF, we phenotyped longitudinal specimens of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from nine individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were exclusively Th1 cells, and predominantly Tcm with phenotypic features of robust helper function. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly Temra cells in a state of less terminal differentiation than most Temra cells. Subsets of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells express CD127, can homeostatically proliferate, and can persist for over two months. Our results suggest that long-lived and robust T cell immunity is generated following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, and support an important role for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in host control of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason Neidleman","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; and Gladstone Institutes"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Luo","author_inst":"Gladstone Institutes"},{"author_name":"Julie Frouard","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; and Gladstone Institutes"},{"author_name":"Guorui Xie","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; and Gladstone Institutes"},{"author_name":"Gurjot Gill","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Ellen S.

Currently there is no vaccine, effective therapeutic or prophylactic. Like other betacoronaviruses, attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based differences in anti-viral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH and 6-O-desulfated enoxaparin with an IC50 of 5.99 {micro}g\/L, 1.08 mg\/L, 1.77 {micro}g\/L, and 5.86 mg\/L respectively. The low serum bioavailability of intranasally administered UFH, along with data suggesting that the nasal epithelium is a portal for initial infection and transmission, suggest that intranasal administration of UFH may be an effective and safe prophylactic treatment.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ritesh Tandon","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua S.

Understanding the antibody response directed against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the development of vaccine, therapeutic and public health interventions. Here we performed a cross-sectional study on 106 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to evaluate humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike. The vast majority of infected individuals elicited anti-Spike antibodies within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The levels of receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG persisted overtime, while the levels of anti-RBD IgM decreased after symptoms resolution. Some of the elicited antibodies cross-reacted with other human coronaviruses in a genus-restrictive manner. While most of individuals developed neutralizing antibodies within the first two weeks of infection, the level of neutralizing activity was significantly decreased over time. Our results highlight the importance of studying the persistence of neutralizing activity upon natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremie Prevost","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Romain Gasser","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Richard","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Ralf Duerr","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Sai Priya Anand","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Goyette","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Benlarbi","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Shilei Ding","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Halima Medjahed","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Antoine Lewin","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Josee Perreault","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Tony Tremblay","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Gendron-Lepage","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Gauthier","author_inst":"Hopital Sacre-Coeur de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Marc Carrier","author_inst":"Hopital Cite-de-la-Sante"},{"author_name":"Diane Marcoux","author_inst":"Hotel-Dieu de Levis"},{"author_name":"Alain Piche","author_inst":"CHU Sherbrooke"},{"author_name":"Myriam Lavoie","author_inst":"Hopital de Chicoutimi"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Benoit","author_inst":"Hoptial de Verdun"},{"author_name":"Vilayvong Loungnarath","author_inst":"CHU de Quebec"},{"author_name":"Gino Brochu","author_inst":"CIUSSS de la Mauricie-et-du-Centre-du-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Elie Haddad","author_inst":"CHU Ste-Justine"},{"author_name":"Hannah D Stacey","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Matthew S Miller","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Marc Desforges","author_inst":"CHU Ste-Justine"},{"author_name":"Pierre J Talbot","author_inst":"INRS"},{"author_name":"Graham T Gould Maule","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Marceline Cote","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Christian Therrien","author_inst":"LSPQ"},{"author_name":"Bouchra Serhir","author_inst":"LSPQ"},{"author_name":"Renee Bazin","author_inst":"Hema-Quebec"},{"author_name":"Michel Roger","author_inst":"LSPQ"},{"author_name":"Andres Finzi","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Teresa Lockett","author_inst":"NIHR Clinical Research Network Thames Valley & South Midlands"},{"author_name":"Robert Levin","author_inst":"Worthing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shona C Moore","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Mariolina Salio","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Napolitani","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ling Chen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susie Dunachie","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jose Slon-Campos","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Guido Paeson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Grimes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fred Antson","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Oliver W Bayfield","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Dorothy EDP Hawkins","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"De-Sheng Ker","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Azim Ansari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ellie Barnes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Frater","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Georgina Kerr","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip Goulder","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"}]}
