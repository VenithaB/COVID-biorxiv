The time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was December 17, 2019 (95% HPD: December 7, 2019 - December 23, 2019). The median estimate of Re shifted from 1.6 to 1.1 on around January 1, 2020.

The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robin Nicholas Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mei Wang","author_inst":"PKU"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"ecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.23.916726","rel_title":"Modelling the epidemic trend of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","rel_date":"2020-01-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.23.916726","rel_abs":"We present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov epidemic in its initial phase, where 2019-nCov demonstrates comparable transmissibility but lower fatality rates than SARS and MERS.

Despite intense research effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing4 identified a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Su Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Bin Yu","author_inst":"Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yan-Mei Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Hu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Zhi-Gang Song","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhao-Wu Tao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Jun-Hua Tian","author_inst":"Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Yuan Pei","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Li Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Fa-Hui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Qi-Min Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jiao-Jiao Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Lin Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydn"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.23.20018549","rel_title":"Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions","rel_date":"2020-01-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.23.20018549","rel_abs":"Since first identified, the epidemic scale of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, has increased rapidly, with cases arising across China and other countries and regions. using a transmission model, we estimate a basic reproductive number of 3.11 (95%CI, 2.39-4.13);

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.\n\nMethodsAccounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate ({gamma}), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.\n\nFindingsThe early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate.

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIt is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human.

The epidemic, started from December 12th, 2019, has caused 198 laboratory confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20th, 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96% identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. The nCoV-2019 virus was then isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, which can be neutralized by sera from several patients. Importantly, we have confirmed that this novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Zhou","author_inst":"CAS Key

diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.\n\nImportanceNo antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zachary J Sandler","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Michelle N Vu","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Vineet D.

Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael C Letko","author_inst":"NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vineet D.

Every year, users contribute thousands of reports that include reference to infectious diseases and toxins, and these reports are then distributed to all subscribers of ProMED. However, the corpus of reports has not been well studied so far. Thus, we propose to apply text mining methods to derive information pertinent to the characterisation of the stage of an epidemic outbreak from the reports. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in ProMED reports in three steps: reports filtering, keywords extraction from reports and finally word co-occurrence network analysis. The keyword extraction was performed with the TextRank algorithm, keywords co-occurrence networks were then produced using the top keywords from each document and multiple network centrality measures were computed to analyse the co-occurrence networks. We used two major outbreaks in recent years, Ebola 2014 and Zika 2015, as cases to illustrate and validate the process. Results: We found that the information structures extracted at different stages of outbreaks from ProMED are consistent with response strategies as well as situation reports of the World Health Organisation. Conclusion: This study shows that ProMED provides large valuable information to characterise the evolution of epidemic outbreaks. Our research presents a pipeline that can extract and organise this information in a meaningful way. It also highlights the potential for ProMED mail to be utilised in monitoring, evaluating and improving responses to outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingxian You","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Expert","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ceire Costelloe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zeyu Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jing-An Cui","author_inst":"Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture"},{"author_name":"Ling Yin","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao-Rui Si","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bei Li","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chao-Lin Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui-Dong Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yun Luo","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hua Guo","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ren-Di Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mei-Qin Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ying Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xu-Rui Shen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Shuang Zheng","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhao","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Quan-Jiao Chen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lin-Lin Liu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Yan","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fa-Xian Zhan","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan-Yi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng-Li Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/782409","rel_title":"Coronavirus Interferon Antagonists Differentially Modulate the Host Response during Replication in Macrophages","rel_date":"2019-09-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/782409","rel_abs":"Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceCoronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin\/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2\/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufang Deng","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Yafang Chen","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Anna M Mielech","author_inst":"Loyola University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hackbart","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kristina  R Kesely","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Robert  C Mettelman","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amornrat O\u2019Brien","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mackenzie E.
