Mixed guidance exists on the aerosol generating potential of orthodontic procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate aerosol and\/or splatter contamination during an orthodontic debonding procedure. Material and Methods: Fluorescein dye was introduced into the oral cavity of a mannequin. Orthodontic debonding was carried out in triplicate with filter papers placed in the immediate environment. Composite bonding cement was removed using a slow-speed handpiece with dental suction. A positive control condition included a high-speed air-turbine crown preparation. Samples were analysed using digital image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis. Results: Contamination across the 8-metre experimental rig was 3% of the positive control on spectrofluorometric analysis and 0% on image analysis. There was contamination of the operator, assistant, and mannequin, representing 8%, 25%, and 28% of the positive control spectrofluorometric measurements, respectively. Discussion: Orthodontic debonding produces splatter within the immediate locality of the patient. Widespread aerosol generation was not observed. Conclusions: Orthodontic debonding procedures are low risk for aerosol generation, but localised splatter is likely. This highlights the importance of personal protective equipment for the operator, assistant, and patient.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hayley Llandro","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"James Allison","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Currie","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"David Edwards","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Bowes","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Jakubovics","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Nadia Rostami","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"dentistry and oral medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20178509","rel_title":"Lockdown, relaxation, and ACME period in COVID-19: A study of disease dynamics on Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20178509","rel_abs":"Lockdown and social distancing measures have been implemented for many countries to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming of health services. However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. A Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early ACME around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, results concerning relaxation dynamics showed that the ACME levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities as well as the individual behavior with respect to prevention measures. Analysis regarding different relaxing mitigation measures were provided to the Sonoran Health Ministry, as requested. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the ACME occurring time was closed to the one given by our model. Hence, we considered that our model resulted useful for the decision-making assessment, and that an extension of it can be used for the study of a potential second wave.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayra Tocto-Erazo","author_inst":"University of Sonora"},{"author_name":"Jorge A.

Since its emergence in late December 2019 and its declaration as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease known as (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. The process of modeling and predicting the pandemic behavior became crucial as the different states needed accurate predictions to be able to adopt suitable policies to minimize the pressure on their health care systems. Researchers have employed modified variants of classical SIR\/SEIR models to describe the dynamics of this pandemic. In this paper, after proven effective in numerous countries, a modified variant of SEIR is implemented to predict the behavior of COVID-19 in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East. Methods. We built MATLAB simulations to fit the real data of COVID-19 Active, recovered and death Cases in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to the modified SEIR model via Nelder-Mead algorithm to be able to estimate the future dynamics of the pandemic. Findings. We estimate several characteristics of COVID-19 future dynamics in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. We also estimate that the pandemic will resolve in the countries under investigation in February 2021, January 2021 and 28th August 2020 with total death cases of 9,742, 5,600 and 185 and total cases of 187,600, 490,000 and 120,000 respectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed E Fahmy","author_inst":"Zewail University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mohammed M Eldesouky","author_inst":"Zewail University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmed S.A.

In order to avoid excessive restriction to the social activity, a good strategy of quarantine based on a realistic model is expected. Several epidemic models with a quarantine compartment such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model have been applied. However, in the actual situation, the infection test and quarantine is often delayed from the beginning of the infectious stage. This article presents a delayed SEIQR model to analyze the effect of the delay of quarantine. The latency period (compartment E) and the incubation period were assumed to be 3 days and 5 days, respectively. Considering that the presymptomatic infection ratio is 0.4, the natural decay rate of the number of infectious patients was assumed to be 0.25 days-1. The recovery rate was assumed to be 0.07 days-1 from the typical PCR test positive period. The PCR test positive number in the period from March 10 to July 18 in 2020 in Tokyo area was analyzed. The delay time distribution of the quarantine was derived from the record of the symptom onset date, and was utilized to determine the delay time profile of quarantine in the model. It was found that the major contributor to the infection control was the restraint of social contact. However, the quarantine action also contributed to reducing the reproduction number by the ratio of 0.88 and 0.8 in the period from March 10 to June 3 and from June 4 to July 18, respectively. The delay of quarantine was found to be well correlated to the effectiveness of quarantine. Therefore a record on a symptom onset date is very important to estimate the effect of quarantine measure. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.56. In view of the presymptomatic infection ratio 0.4, it would be very hard to restrain the expansion of infection only by quarantining the symptomatic patients.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kazuo Maki","author_inst":"MediEco R&D Corporation"},{"author_name":"Osman Khan","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Meeks","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Marc Boom","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Faisal Masud","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Julia Andrieni","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Robert Phillips","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Yordanos Tiruneh","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Bita Kash","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Farhaan Vahidy","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178285","rel_title":"Potential interruptions in HIV prevention and treatment services for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men associated with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178285","rel_abs":"Background Globally, the coronavirus pandemic has necessitated a range of population-based measures in order to stem the spread of infection and reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 mitigation strategies and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM. Methods Data for this study were collected as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app Hornet, with data collected between April 16th, 2020 and May 24th, 2020. Data were assessed for countries where at least 50 participants completed the survey, to best evaluate country-level heterogeneity. We used a modified Poisson regression model, with clustering at the country-level, to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index; each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to school and workplace closures and travel bans. Results A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included in these analyses. The mean age was 34.2 (standard deviation: 10.8), and 12% (1264\/10540) of participants reported living with HIV. The median stringency score was 82.31 (Range:[19.44, Belarus]-[92.59, Ukraine]). For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of access to in-person testing (aPR: 0.97, 95% CI:[0.96, 0.98]), a 6% reduction in the prevalence of access to self-testing (aPR: 0.94, 95% CI:[0.93, 0.95]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 0.95, 95% CI:[0.95, 0.97]). Among those living with HIV, close to one in five (n=218\/1105) participants reported being unable to access their provider either in-person or via telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a greater proportion of interruptions to treatment services reported in Belarus and Mexico. Almost half (n=820\/1254) reported being unable to refill their HIV medicine prescription remotely. Conclusions More stringent government responses were associated with decreased access to HIV diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to facilitate minimize service interruptions to MSM communities during this and potential future waves of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amrita Rao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rucinski","author_inst":"Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Brooke Jarrett","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ackerman","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sara Wallach","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Julia Marcus","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston USA; Fenway Institute, Boston USA"},{"author_name":"Tyler Adamson","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Alex Garner","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Glenn-Milo Santos","author_inst":"Community Health Systems Department, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, USA; Center of Public Health Research, San Francisco Department of P"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sean Howell","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178228","rel_title":"COVID19 epidemic growth rates have declined since early March in U.S. regions with active hospitalized case surveillance","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178228","rel_abs":"Introduction Optimal pandemic monitoring and management requires unbiased and regionally specific estimates of disease incidence and epidemic growth. Methods I estimated growth rates and doubling times across a 22-week period of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic using hospital admissions incidence data collected through the US CDC COVID-NET surveillance program which operates in 98 U.S. counties located in 13 states. I cross validated the growth measures using mortality incidence data for the same regions and time periods. Results Between March 1 and August 8, 2020, two distinct waves of epidemic activity occurred. During the first wave in the COVID-NET monitoring regions, the harmonic mean of the maximum weekly growth rate was 534% (Median: 575; Range: 250 to 2250) and this maximum occurred in the second or third week of March in different regions. The harmonic mean of the minimum doubling time occurred with maximum growth rate and was 0.35 weeks (Median 0.36 weeks; Range: 0.22 to 0.55 weeks). The harmonic mean of the maximum incidence rate during the first wave of the epidemic was 8.5 hospital admissions per 100,000 people per week (Median: 9.2, Range: 4 to 40.5) and the peak of epidemic infection transmission associated with this maximum occurred on or before March 27, 2020 in eight of the 13 regions. Dividing the 22-week observed period into four intervals, the harmonic mean of the weekly hospitalization incidence rate was highest during the second interval (4.6 hospitalizations per week per 100,000), then fell during the third and fourth intervals. Growth rates declined from 101 percent per week in the first interval to 2.5 percent per week in the last. Doubling time have lengthened from 3\/5th of a week in the first interval to 12.5 weeks in the last. Period by period, the cumulative incidence has grown primarily in a linear mode. The mean cumulative incidence of hospitalizations on Aug 8th, 2020 in the COVID-NET regions is 96 hospitalizations per 100,000. Regions which experienced the highest maximum weekly incidence rates or greatest cumulative incidence rates in the first wave, generally, but not uniformly, observed the lower incidence rates in the second wave. Growth measures calculated based on mortality incidence data corroborate these findings. Conclusions Declining epidemic growth rates of SARS-COV-2 infection appeared in early March in the first observations of nationwide hospital admissions surveillance program in multiple U.S. regions. A sizable fraction of the U.S. population may have been infected in a cryptic February epidemic acceleration phase. To more accurately monitor epidemic trends and inform pandemic mitigation planning going forward, the US CDC needs measures of epidemic disease incidence that better reflect clinical disease and account for large variations in case ascertainment strategies over time.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajiv Bhatia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rucinski","author_inst":"Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Brooke Jarrett","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ackerman","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sara Wallach","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Julia Marcus","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston USA; Fenway Institute, Boston USA"},{"author_name":"Tyler Adamson","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Alex Garner","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Glenn-Milo Santos","author_inst":"Community Health Systems Department, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, USA; Center of Public Health Research, San Francisco Department of P"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sean Howell","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178111","rel_title":"Effective Reproduction Number and Dispersion under Contact Tracing and Lockdown on COVID-19 in Karnataka","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178111","rel_abs":"We analyze the data provided in the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) media bulletins of the Government of Karnataka.

We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. Methods: We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV, the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. Results: With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to >99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. Conclusion: To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cathie Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK; Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Peter Diggle","author_inst":"University of Lancaster; Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Oliver Warlow","author_inst":"Ventient Energy"},{"author_name":"David Seymour","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Ben Gordon","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Rhos Walker","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Charles Warlow","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alex Garner","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Glenn-Milo Santos","author_inst":"Community Health Systems Department, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, USA; Center of Public Health Research, San Francisco Department of P"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sean Howell","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178343","rel_title":"The Effects of Coronavirus Victimization Distress and Coronavirus Racial Bias on Mental Health Among Black, Indigenous and Latinx Young Adults in the United States","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178343","rel_abs":"Background. People of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of young adult people of color. Method. An online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and Latinx adults (18 to 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias. Results. Employment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health measures across all groups. Conclusions. Results suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial\/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Celia B.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of reported symptoms and comorbidities and assess the correlation between a series of symptoms and comorbidities and age of the patients' positive in COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis [PROSPERO registration: CRD42020182677]. Databases [PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, WHO, Semantic Scholar, and COVID-19 Primer] were searched for clinical studies published from January to April 2020. The pooled prevalence of symptoms and comorbidities were identified using the random effect model, and the multivariable factor analysis was performed to show the correlation between a group of symptoms and comorbidities and age of the COVID-19 patients. Findings: Twenty-nine articles [China (24); Outside of China (5)], with 4,884 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The meta-analysis investigated 33 symptoms, where fever [84%], cough\/dry cough [61%], and fatigue\/weakness [42%] were found more prevalent. Out of 43 comorbidities investigated, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [61%], hypertension [23%] and diabetes [12%] were the most prevalent comorbid condition. The multivariable factor analysis showed positive association between a group of symptoms and comorbidities, and with the patients' age. For example, the symptoms comprising fever, dyspnea\/shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, anorexia and pharyngalgia; and the comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, COPD\/lung disease and ARDS were positively correlated with the COVID-19 patient's age.

The risk of within-household infection is greatly increased among those from Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and low income communities. Efforts to protect these communities are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to explore the acceptability of the availability of accommodation to support isolation among at risk populations. Methods Our study used a mixed methods design structured in two phases. In phase 1, we conducted a survey study of a sample of volunteers from our existing database of 300 individuals who had provided consent to be contacted about ongoing research projects into infection control. In phase 2, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 participants from BAME communities and low income communities recruited through social media. Results Participants from the survey and interview phase of the study viewed the provision of accommodation as important and necessary. Factors influencing likely uptake of accommodation included perceived 1) vulnerability of household 2) exposure to the virus and 3) options for isolation at home. Barriers to accepting the offer of accommodation included 1) being able to isolate at home 2) wanting to be with family 3) caring responsibilities 4) concerns about mental wellbeing 5) upheaval of moving when ill and 6) concerns about infection control. Participants raised a series of issues that should be addressed before accommodation is offered. These included questions regarding who should use temporary accommodation and at what stage to effectively reduce transmission in the home, and how infection control in temporary accommodation would be managed. Conclusion This research provides evidence that the provision of accommodation to prevent within household transmission of the virus is viewed as acceptable, feasible and necessary by many people who are concerned about infection transmission in the home. We explore ways in which accommodation might be offered. In particular, vulnerable members of the household could be protected if accommodation is offered to individuals who are informed through test trace and isolate that they have been in contact with the virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Denford","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Kate S Morton","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Horwood","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Rachel de Garang","author_inst":"Public Contributor"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Sorowar Hossain","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka-1230, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mahbubul H Siddiqee","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka-1230, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.

Design Cross sectional study of three key worker groups. Setting Six acute NHS hospitals and two Police and Fire and Rescue sites in England. Participants Individuals were recruited from three streams: (A) Police and Fire and Rescue services (n=1147), (B) healthcare workers (n=1546) and (C) healthcare workers with previously positive virus detection (n=154). Main outcome measures Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma. Results 943 of the 2847 participants (33%) reported belief they had had COVID-19, having experienced compatible symptoms (including 152 from Stream C). Among individuals reporting COVID-19 compatible symptoms, 466 (49%) were seronegative on both Nucleoprotein (Roche) and Spike-protein (EUROIMMUN) antibody assays. However, among the 268 individuals with prior positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, of whom 96% reported symptoms with onset a median of 63 days (IQR 52 to 75 days) prior to venesection, Roche and EUROIMMUN assays had 96.6% (95% CI 93.7% to 98.2%) and 93.3% (95% CI 89.6% to 95.7%) sensitivity respectively. Symptomatic but seronegative individuals had significantly earlier symptom onset dates than the symptomatic seropositive individuals, shorter illness duration and a much lower anosmia reporting frequency. Conclusions Self-reported belief of COVID-19 was common among our frontline worker cohort. About half of these individuals were seronegative, despite a high sensitivity of serology in this cohort, at least in individuals with previous positive PCR results. This is compatible with non-COVID-19 respiratory disease during the COVID-19 outbreak having been commonly mistaken for COVID-19 within the key worker cohort studied.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ranya Mulchandani","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sian Taylor-Phillips","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Hayley Jones","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Tony Ades","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ray Borrow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ezra Linley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Peter Kirwan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Richard Stewart","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philippa Moore","author_inst":"Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Boyes","author_inst":"Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Anil Hormis","author_inst":"The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Todd","author_inst":"York Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Antoanela Colda","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20177667","rel_title":"How early into the outbreak can surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater tell us?","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20177667","rel_abs":"There is increasing interest to use wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as an early warning of the outbreak within a community.

To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank and biological activated sludge tank located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that > 253 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The occurrence frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 5 times lower in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. Furthermore, abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting poor persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments in wastewater.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peiying Hong","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Andri Taruna Rachmadi","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"David Mantilla-Calderon","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Alkahtani","author_inst":"Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Yasir M.

In the present study we described the clinical course and risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality of SARS-Cov-2 positive patients affected by acute respiratory failure, hospitalized in a Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit in the south of Italy. Methods In this retrospective, observational single centre study we evaluated 96 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients affected by acute respiratory failure (ARF). We compared demographic data, laboratory data and clinical outcomes between deceased and survived patients, aiming to identify risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality, and possible gender-related differences. Results Of 96 patients, 51 (53.1%) survived and 45 (46.9 %) died. Among those who died, 23 (51.1%) deceased in RICU. Twenty-nine (30.2%) were transferred to ICU, of whom 22 (75.9%) died in ICU. Patients affected by COPD have a higher mortality compared to patients without this comorbidity (p=0.002). Lower baseline P\/F ratio (p=0,014) and neurologic comorbidities (p=0,008) emerged as risk factors for death. Male were younger than female patients (66 vs 80 y.o.; p=0.042). In female patients, lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count (p=0.007) is a risk factor for death, characteristic gender-related in our sample. Female sex was a protective parameter against transfer to ICU (p=0,036) and P\/F ratio was not a significant predictor of transfer to ICU (p=0,227). Only higher baseline CRP (p=0,034) has shown a predictive role for transfer to ICU in our sample. Patients deceased after a transfer to ICU had younger age (p=0,000), lower median comorbidity number (p=0,000), lower D-dimer (p=0,029) and lower prevalence of female sex (p=0,029). Discussion Mortality in our study was similar to that found in other studies involving patients in non-invasive ventilation. In our study older age and comorbidities play as predictors of death in COVID-19 patients. COPD, despite presenting low prevalence, is a risk factor for death, both in men and women. In female patients chronic ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure are death predictors. High CRP and lymphopenia, linked to inflammatory status, are predictors of transfer to ICU. Patients transferred to ICU higher mortality than the others, and patients who die in ICU are mostly men, younger and have less comorbidities. Baseline P\/F ratio is not a good predictor of transfer to ICU, while in our sample is a sensible predictor of death. More studies need to be performed on COVID-19 patients, in the urgency of COVID-19 pandemic persistence.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enrico Buonamico","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vitaliano Nicola Quaranta","author_inst":"\"Di Venere\" Hospital of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Esterina Boniello","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michela Dimitri","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Majorano","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luciana Labate","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Pierucci","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Barratta","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Elisiana Carpagnano","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Onofrio Resta","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anil Hormis","author_inst":"The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Todd","author_inst":"York Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Antoanela Colda","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.21.261727","rel_title":"The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike is the key target of neutralizing antibody in human polyclonal sera.","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.21.261727","rel_abs":"Natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans leads to the development of a strong neutralizing antibody response, however the immunodominant targets of the polyclonal neutralizing antibody response are still unknown.

Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response. We show that epitopes within RBD are the target of a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the human polyclonal antibody response.

In this study, we aim to predict the effect of COVID-19 on hospital resources in Nigeria. Method: We adopted a previously published discrete-time, individual-level, health-state transition model of symptomatic COVID-19 patients to the Nigerian healthcare system and COVID-19 epidemiology. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectories and acute care capacity. Primary outcomes included expected cumulative number of cases, days until depletion resources, and the number of deaths associated with resource constraints. Outcomes were predicted over a 60-day time horizon. Results: In our best-case epidemic trajectory, which implies successful implementation of public health measures to control COVID-19 spread, the current number of ventilator resources in Nigeria (conservative resources scenario), were expended within five days, and 901 patients may die while waiting for hospital resources in conservative resource scenario. In our expanded resource scenarios, ventilated ICU beds were depleted in all three epidemic trajectories within 60 days. Acute care resources were only sufficient in the best-case and intermediate epidemic scenarios, combined with a substantial increase in healthcare resources. Conclusion: Current hospital resources are inadequate to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Given Nigeria's limited resources, it is imperative to increase healthcare resources and maintain aggressive public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adeteju Ogunbameru","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, Universi"},{"author_name":"Kali Barrett","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborat"},{"author_name":"Arinola Joda","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lagos,Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Yasin A Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborat"},{"author_name":"Petros Pechlivanoglou","author_inst":"IHPME, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, University Health Network, Toronto, ON; Chi"},{"author_name":"Stephen Mac","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborat"},{"author_name":"David Naimark","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON"},{"author_name":"Raphael Ximenes","author_inst":"Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, University Health Network, Toronto, ON; Escola de Matematica Aplicada, Fundacao Getuli"},{"author_name":"Beate Sander","author_inst":"IHPME, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, UHN, Toronto, ON;ICES, Toronto, ON ;  Publi"},{"author_name":"Sarah L George","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Sariol","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus"},{"author_name":"Amelia K Pinto","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"James D Brien","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20174912","rel_title":"Longitudinal analysis of virus load, serum antibody levels and virus neutralizing activity in vitro in cases with less severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20174912","rel_abs":"Background: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a highly variable clinical course, varying from barely discernible signs of disease, to moderate flu-like symptoms and, occasionally, with life-threatening pneumonia and\/or cytokine storm. The relationship between the nasopharyngeal virus load, IgA and IgG antibodies to both the S1-RBD-protein and the N-protein as well the neutralizing activity (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of moderately afflicted COVID-19 patients has not been investigated longitudinally so far. Methods: Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed and validated for the longitudinal investigation in three patients of a family which underwent a mild course of COVID-19. Findings: We observed that the virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks, whereas serum antibodies showed a contrasting course. IgA levels to S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau approximately six weeks after disease onset. NAbs in serum reached a peak about four weeks after disease onset but dropped to a lower level about six weeks later. Interpretation: Our data establishes associations of virus neutralization and a serological immune response foremost against Sars-CoV-2 S1-RDB-protein in a longitudinal manner.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bertram Flehmig","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Tuebingen and Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Michael Schindler","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ruetalo","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Ramona Businger","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Manfred Bayer","author_inst":"4base lab AG advanced molecular analysis"},{"author_name":"Angelika Haage","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kirchner","author_inst":"Pediatric Praxis Weil der Stadt"},{"author_name":"Karin Klingel","author_inst":"Institute for Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Andrea Normann","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Lutz Pridzun","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Despina Tougianidou","author_inst":"4base lab AG advanced molecular analysis"},{"author_name":"Michael B Ranke","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"James D Brien","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178178","rel_title":"Serum neopterin levels in relation to mild and severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178178","rel_abs":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly spreading worldwide. There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol\/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol\/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol\/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol\/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol\/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol\/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in clinical praxis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Josefina Robertson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Johanna M Gostner","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Dietmar Fuchs","author_inst":"Institute of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gisslen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kirchner","author_inst":"Pediatric Praxis Weil der Stadt"},{"author_name":"Karin Klingel","author_inst":"Institute for Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Andrea Normann","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Lutz Pridzun","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Despina Tougianidou","author_inst":"4base lab AG advanced molecular analysis"},{"author_name":"Michael B Ranke","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"James D Brien","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20175091","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Positive Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients; a multisource Electronic Healthcare Records Study from England","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20175091","rel_abs":"Background: Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. However, there is limited information on management and outcomes of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and concomitant COVID19 infection. Objectives: This multisource national analysis of live data from England was designed to characterise the presenting profile and outcomes of patients hospitalized with ACS and COVID-19 infection. Methods: Multisource data from all acute NHS hospital in England was linked to study the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 ACS compared to non COVID-19 ACS patients. Hierarchical multilevel models were constructed to study the association between COVID19 ACS and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Results: Between 1st March 2020 and 31st May 2020, 517 (4.0%) were admitted with COVID- 19 ACS from a total of 12,958 ACS patients. COVID-19 ACS patients were generally older, BAME ethnicity, more comorbid and had unfavourable presenting characteristics compared to non-COVID-19 ACS patients. They were less likely to receive invasive coronary strategy in the form of coronary angiography (67.7% vs 81.0%), PCI (30.2% vs 53.9%), dual antiplatelet medication 76.3% vs 88.0%), and other important secondary medication. Patients with COVID-19 ACS had higher in-hospital (aOR 3.27 95%CI 2.41-4.42) and 30-day mortality (aOR 6.53 95%CI 5.1-8.36) compared to non COVID-19 ACS group. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is prevalent but less frequent in the patients hospitalized with ACS in England. Presence of COVID-19 infection in patients with ACS is associated with significant mortality hazard.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Rashid","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Adam Timmis","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Nick Curzen","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Azfar Zaman","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Sarah Clarke","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Nolan","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Shoiab","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed O Mohamed","author_inst":"Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Keele University, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Mark De Belder","author_inst":"NICOR"},{"author_name":"John Deanfield","author_inst":"University college London"},{"author_name":"Chris Gale","author_inst":"Leeds university"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20178301","rel_title":"SARS-Cov-2 proliferation: an analytical aggregate-level model","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20178301","rel_abs":"An intuitive mathematical model describing the virus proliferation is presented and its parameters estimated from time series of observed reported CoViD-19 cases in Germany.

The model differs in form from elementary SIR models, but is contained in the general Kermack-McKendrick (1927) model. It is maintained that (compared to elementary SIR models) the model is more faithfully representing real proliferation at the instantaneous level, leading to overall more plausible association of model parameters to physical transmission and recovery parameters. The main policy-oriented results are that (1) mitigation measures imposed in March 2020 in Germany were absolutely necessary to avoid health care resource exhaustion, (2) fast response is key to containment in case of renewed outbreaks.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed for the prevention of acute exacerbations in people with COPD, but their use is associated with increased risk of respiratory infections. The effects of ICS on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity are currently unknown. Objectives: To determine the effects of ICS treatment on the bronchial epithelial cell expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in volunteers with COPD. Methods: We performed a randomized, open-label, parallel treatment trial of 12 weeks treatment with ICS in combination with long-acting beta-agonist (formoterol\/budesonide 12\/400 g twice daily or salmeterol\/fluticasone propionate 25\/250 g twice daily), or treatment with LABA only (formoterol 12 g twice daily), in volunteers with mild to very severe COPD. We obtained bronchial epithelial cell samples via bronchoscopy before and after treatment, and determined transcriptome-wide gene expression by RNA sequencing. Main Results: 63 volunteers were randomized to receive treatment. Compared to formoterol alone, formoterol\/budesonide treatment decreased the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene ACE2 and the host cell protease gene ADAM17. These genes were highly co-expressed with innate immune response genes, particularly those of the type I interferon and anti-viral response pathways, which also tended to decrease following ICS treatment. Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that ICS affect the expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in COPD. Their relation to important anti-viral response genes may have critical implications for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity in this vulnerable population.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Milne","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation and Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Chen Xi Yang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Ana I Hernandez Cordero","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Fernando Sergio Leitao Filho","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Cheng Wei Tony Yang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation and Providence Health Care - Providence Airway Centre"},{"author_name":"Tawimas Shaipanich","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephan F van Eeden","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation and Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Janice M Leung","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation and Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Lam","author_inst":"BC Cancer Research Centre Department of Integrative Oncology and University of British Columbia Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia Centre for Heart Lung Innovation and Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chris Gale","author_inst":"Leeds university"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20178525","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Diabetic COVID-19 patients in Kuwait","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20178525","rel_abs":"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and rapidly turned into a global pandemic, resulting in what is now known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We describe a diverse group of SARS-CoV-2 positive paediatric patients treated at a large tertiary\/quaternary children`s hospital in the United Kingdom and the adaptive coping strategies required. Methods: All paediatric patients with positive RT-PCR on a respiratory sample and\/or serology for SARS-CoV-2 up to 19th May 2020 were included. Results: 57 children met the inclusion criteria. 70% were of non-Caucasian ethnicity with a median age of 9.3 years (IQR 5.16-13.48). Four distinct groups were identified: paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) (54%), primary respiratory (18%), incidental (7%), and non-specific febrile illnesses with or without extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction (21%). These groups presented in distinct chronological blocks as the pandemic unfolded. Discussion: The diverse range of presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population exemplified the importance of preparedness for the unknown in the midst of a novel infectious pandemic. Descriptions of paediatric patients during the initial phase of the pandemic from other parts of the globe and extrapolation from adult data did not serve as an accurate representation of paediatric COVID-19 in our centre. An adaptive, multidisciplinary approach was paramount. Expanded laboratory testing and incorporation of technology platforms to facilitate remote collaboration in response to strict infection control precautions were both indispensable. Lessons learned during the preparation process will be essential in planning for a potential second wave of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nele Alders","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin Penner","author_inst":"Justin.Penner@nhs.net"},{"author_name":"Karlie Grant","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Patterson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Jane Hassell","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Nathalie MacDermott","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sian Pincott","author_inst":"Department of General Paediatrics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Bamford","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Pascale du Pre","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mae Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Karyn Moshal","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Chris Gale","author_inst":"Leeds university"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20178566","rel_title":"Development of antibodies to pan-coronavirus spike peptides in convalescent COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20178566","rel_abs":"Coronaviruses are sharing several protein regions notable the spike protein (S) on their enveloped membrane surface, with the S1 subunit recognizing and binding to the cellular receptor, while the S2 subunit mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion. This similarity opens the question whether infection with one coronavirus will confer resistance to other coronaviruses? Investigating patient serum samples after SARS-CoV-2 infection in cross-reactivity studies of immunogenic peptides from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we were able to detect the production of antibodies also recognizing MERS virus antigens. The cross-reactive peptide comes from the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the MERS virus spike protein. Indeed, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein, previously proven to induce antibodies against MERS-CoV is sharing 74% homology with the corresponding sequence of SARS-CoV-19 virus. Sera samples of 47 convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, validated by RT-PCR-negative testes 30 days post-infection, and samples of 40 sera of control patients (not infected with SARS-CoV-2 previously) were used to establish eventual cross-bind reactivity with the MERS peptide antigen. Significantly stronger binding (p<0.0001) was observed for IgG antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to the control group. If used as an antigen, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein allows discrimination between post-Covid populations from non-infected ones by the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This suggests that polyclonal antibodies established during SARS-CoV-2 infection has the ability to recognize and probably decrease infectiveness of MERS-CoV infections as well as other coronaviruses. The high homology of the spike protein domain suggests in addition that the opposite effect can also be true: coronaviral infections producing cross-reactive antibodies affective against SARS-CoV-19. The collected data prove in addition that despite the core HR2 region being hidden in the native viral conformation, its exposure during cell entry makes it highly immunogenic. Since inhibitory peptides to this region were previously described, this opens new possibilities in fighting coronaviral infections.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrii Rabets","author_inst":"Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University"},{"author_name":"Galyna Bila","author_inst":"Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University"},{"author_name":"Roman Grytsko","author_inst":"Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University"},{"author_name":"Markian Samborsky","author_inst":"Explogen LLC"},{"author_name":"Yuriy Rebets","author_inst":"Explogen LLC"},{"author_name":"Sandor Vari","author_inst":"International Research and Innovation in Medicine Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Quentin Pagneux","author_inst":"Univ.

For contact tracing to be effective, those with symptoms must self-report themselves while their contacts must self-isolate when asked. However, policies such as legal enforcement of self-isolation can create trade-offs by dissuading individuals from self-reporting. We use an existing branching process model to examine which aspects of contact tracing adherence should be prioritised. We consider an inverse relationship between self-isolation adherence and self-reporting engagement, assuming that increasingly strict self-isolation policies will result in fewer individuals self-reporting to the programme. We find that policies that increase the verage duration of self-isolation, or that increase the probability that people self-isolate at all, at the expense of reduced self-reporting rate, will not decrease the risk of a large outbreak and may increase the risk, depending on the strength of the trade-off. These results suggest that policies to increase self-isolation adherence should be implemented carefully. Policies that increase self-isolation adherence at the cost of self-reporting rates should be avoided.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tim C D Lucas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emma L Davis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Diepreye Ayabina","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna Borlase","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Crellen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Li Pi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Graham Medley","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"University of Bristol, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Julia Gog","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"T D\u00e9irdre Hollingsworth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Gale","author_inst":"Leeds university"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20178533","rel_title":"High SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Children and Adults in the Austrian Ski Resort Ischgl","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20178533","rel_abs":"Background: Early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl in Austria initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern Europe. Methods: Between April 21 and 27, a cross-sectional epidemiologic study targeting the full population of Ischgl (n= 1867), of which 79% could be included (n=1473, incl. 214 children), was performed. For each individual, the study involved a SARS-CoV-2 PCR, antibody testing and structured questionnaires. A mathematical model was used to help understand the influence of the determined seroprevalence on virus transmission. Findings: The seroprevalence was 42.4% (95% CI 39.8-44.7). Individuals under 18 showed a significantly lower seroprevalence of 27.1% (95% CI 21.3-33.6) than adults (45%; 95% CI 42.2-47.7; OR of 0.455, 95% CI 0.356-0.682, p<0.001). Of the seropositive individuals, 83.7% had not been diagnosed to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection previously. The clinical course was generally mild. Over the previous two months, two COVID-19-related deaths had been recorded, corresponding to an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.25% (95% CI 0.03-0.91). Only 8 (0.5 %) individuals were newly diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this study. Interpretation: Ischgl was hit early and hard by SARS-CoV-2 leading to a high local seroprevalence of 42.4%, which was lower in individuals below the age of 18 than in adults. Mathematical modeling suggests that a drastic decline of newly infected individuals in Ischgl by the end of April occured due to the dual impact from the non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) and a significant immunization of the Ischgl population.

Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from database inception to July 15, 2020, for studies of patients with COVID-19 infection that had available comorbidity information on cancer. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients and the secondary endpoint was the outcomes of COVID-19-infected cancer patients with incidence of severe illness and death rate. We calculated the pooled prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using a random-effects model, and performed meta-regression analyses to explore heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on continent, country, age, sample size and study design. Findings A total of 107 eligible global studies were included in the systematic review. 90 studies with 94,845 COVID-19 patients in which 4,106 patients with cancer morbidity were included in the meta-analysis for prevalence of cancer morbidity among COVID-19 patients. 21 studies with 70,969 COVID-19 patients in which 3,351 patients with cancer morbidity who had severe illness or death during the studies. The overall prevalence of cancer among the COVID-19 patients was 0.07 (95% CI 0.05~0.09). The cancer prevalence in COVID-19 patients of Europe (0.22, 95% CI 0.17~0.28) was higher than that in Asia Pacific (0.04, 95% CI 0.03~0.06) and North America (0.05, 95% CI 0.04~0.06). The prevalence of COVID-19-infected cancer patients over 60 years old was 0.10 (95% CI 0.07~0.14), higher than that of patients equal and less than 60 years old (0.05, 95% CI 0.03~0.06). The pooled prevalence of severe illness among COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27~0.43) and the pooled death rate of COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.18 (95% CI 0.14~0.18). The pooled incidence of severe illness of COVID-19 patients with cancers from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.38(0.24, 0.52), 0.36(0.17, 0.55), and 0.26(0.20, 0.31), respectively; and the pooled death rate from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.17(0.10, 0.24), 0.26(0.13, 0.39), and 0.19(0.13, 0.25), respectively. Interpretation To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive and up-to-date meta-analysis assessing the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients, severe illness incidence and mortality rate. The prevalence of cancer varied significantly in geographical continents and ages. The COVID-19 patients with cancer were at-risk for severe illness and a high death rate. The European COVID-19 patients had the highest cancer prevalence among the three continents examined and were also the most likely to progress to severe illness and death. Although the Asia Pacific COVID-19 patients had the lowest cancer prevalence, their severe illness rate was similar to that of European.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiangy Kong","author_inst":"Department of Breast Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yihang Qi","author_inst":"Department of Breast Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Junjie Huang","author_inst":"Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3100, Australia; WHO Collaborating Centre on Implementation Research for"},{"author_name":"Yongle Zhan","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100021, China"},{"author_name":"Xuzhen Qin","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Qi","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Adejare (Jay) Atanda","author_inst":"School of Community Health and Policy, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"China-Australia Joint Research Center for Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, Xian Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xian, Shanxi, 710061, PR"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Breast Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yi Fang","author_inst":"Department of Breast Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Jia","author_inst":"Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China; International Institute of Spatial Lifecourse Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore MD USA; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, NY USA"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100021, China; Melbourne School "},{"author_name":"Yu Jiang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100021, China"},{"author_name":"Wegene Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Public Health, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dorothee von Laer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Public Health, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"}]}
