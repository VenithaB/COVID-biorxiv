Nationwide data have not been previously reported. We studied the outcomes of Swedish patients at 30 days after ICU admission. Methods We conducted a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs from 6 March-6 May, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease and complete 30-day follow-up. Data including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, intensive care treatments, organ failures and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and the primary outcome. Results A total of 1563 patients were identified. Median ICU length of stay was 12 (5-21) days, and fifteen patients remained in ICU at the time of follow-up. Median age was 61 (52-69), median Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 (46-59), and 66.8% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2\/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 (75.0-140.6) mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. The majority of deaths occurred during ICU admission. Age, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5 [1.1-2.1]), SAPS III score (aOR 1.3 [1.2-1.4]), severe ARDS (aOR 3.1 [2.0-4.8], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy (aOR 1.4 [1.0-1.9]), and CRRT (aOR 2.2 [1.6-3.0]), were associated with increased mortality. With the exception of chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. Conclusions Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units is generally lower than previously reported. Mortality appears to be driven by age, baseline disease severity, the degree of organ failure and ICU treatment, rather than preexisting comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle S Chew","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrik Blixt","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Ahman","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lars Engerstrom","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Vrinnevi Hospital, Norrkoping, Department of Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping"},{"author_name":"Henrik Andersson","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ritva Kiiski Berggren","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and Perioperative Services, Umea University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anders Tegnell","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Reporting, Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sarah McIntyre","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience, Linkoping University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169797","rel_title":"The effect of school closures and reopening strategies on COVID-19 infection dynamics in the San Francisco Bay Area: a cross-sectional survey and modeling analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169797","rel_abs":"Background Large-scale school closures have been implemented worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, the impact of school closures and re-opening on epidemic dynamics remains unclear. Methods We simulated COVID-19 transmission dynamics using an individual-based stochastic model, incorporating social-contact data of school-aged children during shelter-in-place orders derived from Bay Area (California) household surveys. We simulated transmission under observed conditions and counterfactual intervention scenarios between March 17-June 1, and evaluated various fall 2020 K-12 reopening strategies. Findings Between March 17-June 1, assuming children <10 were half as susceptible to infection as older children and adults, we estimated school closures averted a similar number of infections (13,842 cases; 95% CI: 6,290, 23,040) as workplace closures (15,813; 95% CI: 9,963, 22,617) and social distancing measures (7,030; 95% CI: 3,118, 11,676). School closure effects were driven by high school and middle school closures. Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimate that fall 2020 school reopenings will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40.7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1.9, 61.1), middle school teachers (37.2%, 95% CI: 4.6, 58.1), and elementary school teachers (4.1%, 95% CI: -1.7, 12.0). Results are highly dependent on uncertain parameters, notably the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and extent of community transmission amid re-opening. The school-based interventions needed to reduce the risk to fewer than an additional 1% of teachers infected varies by grade level. A hybrid-learning approach with halved class sizes of 10 students may be needed in high schools, while maintaining small cohorts of 20 students may be needed for elementary schools. Interpretation Multiple in-school intervention strategies and community transmission reductions, beyond the extent achieved to date, will be necessary to avoid undue excess risk associated with school reopening. Policymakers must urgently enact policies that curb community transmission and implement within-school control measures to simultaneously address the tandem health crises posed by COVID-19 and adverse child health and development consequences of long-term school closures.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer R Head","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kristin Andrejko","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Qu Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Philip A Collender","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Sophie Phillips","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Anna Boser","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Alexandra K Heaney","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Hoover","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Sean L Wu","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Graham R Northrup","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Karen Click","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Robert Harrison","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Lewnard","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Justin V Remais","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20169847","rel_title":"Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and risk of COVID-19: a cohort analysis in the UK Biobank","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20169847","rel_abs":"Objective To determine the association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and the risk of COVID-19. Design Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting UK Biobank population. Participants 421,048 participants who were recruited in England and alive by January 31st 2020, i.e., the start of COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. 50,815 individuals with psychiatric disorders recorded in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data before the outbreak were included in the exposed group, while 370,233 participants without such conditions were in the unexposed group. Measurements We obtained information on positive results of COVID-19 test as registered in the Public Health England, COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data, and COIVD-19 related deaths from the death registers. We also identified individuals who was hospitalized for infections other than COVID-19 during the follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for multiple confounders. Results The mean age at outbreak was 67.8 years and around 43% of the study participants were male. We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorder, compared with those without such diagnoses. The fully adjusted ORs were 1.44 (95%CI 1.27 to 1.64), 1.67 (1.42 to 1.98), and 2.03 (1.56 to 2.63) for any COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, COVID-19 related death, respectively. The excess risk was observed across all levels of somatic comorbidities and subtypes of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, while further increased with greater number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and increased risk of hospitalization for other infections (1.85 [1.65 to 2.07]). Conclusions Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk of COVID-19, especially severe and fatal COVID-19. The similar association observed for hospitalization for other infections suggests a shared pathway between psychiatric disorders and different infections, including altered immune responses.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huazhen Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Chen","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yao Hu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yilong Chen","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Zeng","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yajing Sun","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiye Ying","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Junhui He","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Qu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Donghao Lu","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Fang Fang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Unnur A Valdimarsd\u00f3ttir","author_inst":"University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Huan Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Justin V Remais","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169664","rel_title":"Estimating the Changing Infection Rate of COVID-19 Using Bayesian Models of Mobility","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169664","rel_abs":"In order to prepare for and control the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic while minimizing its economic impact, the world needs to be able to estimate and predict COVID-19's spread. Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe the prevalence or growth rate of COVID-19; these must be inferred using some kind of model. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian extension to the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model that adds compartments to account for isolation and death and allows the infection rate to vary as a function of both mobility data collected from mobile phones and a latent time-varying factor that accounts for changes in behavior not captured by mobility data. Since confirmed-case data is unreliable, we infer the model's parameters conditioned on deaths data. We replace the exponential-waiting-time assumption of classic compartmental models with Erlang distributions, which allows for a more realistic model of the long lag between exposure and death. The mobility data gives us a leading indicator that can quickly detect changes in the pandemic's local growth rate and forecast changes in death rates weeks ahead of time. This is an analysis of observational data, so any causal interpretations of the model's inferences should be treated as suggestive at best; nonetheless, the model's inferred relationship between different kinds of trips and the infection rate do suggest some possible hypotheses about what kinds of activities might contribute most to COVID-19's spread.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luyang Liu","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Sharad Vikram","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Junpeng Lao","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Alexander D'Amour","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Shawn O'Banion","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Mark Sandler","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Rif A.

Methods: From April 23rd to May 8th 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swab for direct detection through real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and blood for antibodies detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. Results: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included and 71.6% (n=684) were men. Around 22.1% (n=212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n=196) in the police, and 38.7% (n=370) in the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR at the time of recruitment and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n=15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%.

The secondary aim was to quantify the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Methods: Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Data from the 2014-2018 and 2018 American Community Surveys were used. The simulated prevalence was 0.5% and 1.0% for active and past COVID-19, respectively. Bayesian models, informed by published validity estimates, were used to account for misclassification error when estimating the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Results: Failure to account for misclassification error overestimated the simulated prevalence for active and past COVID-19. Adjustment for misclassification error decreased the point estimate for active and past COVID-10 prevalence by 55% and 29%, respectively. Adjustment for sampling method and misclassification error only captured the simulated past COVID-19 prevalence. The simulated active COVID-19 prevalence was only captured when set to 0.7% and above. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data increased the estimated average daily cases by 8%. Conclusions: Random sampling and testing of COVID-19 is needed but must be accompanied by adjustment for misclassification error to avoid over- or underestimating the prevalence. This approach bolsters disease control efforts. Implementing random testing for active COVID-19 may be best in a smaller geographic area with highly prevalent cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ida Sahlu","author_inst":"MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Alexander B Whittaker","author_inst":"MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Fifonsi Adjidossi Gbeasor-Komlanvi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Arnold Junior Sadio","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Martin Kouame Tchankoni","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique (CARESP), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Koffi Segbeaya Komlanvi","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique (CARESP), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mounerou Salou","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ameyo Monique Dorkenoo","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Issaka Maman","author_inst":"Institut National d'Hygiene (INH), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ametepe Agbobli","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Majeste Ihou Wateba","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Komi Seraphin Adjoh","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Edem Goeh Akue","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Yem-bla Kao","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Innocent Kpeto","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Paul Pana","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Kinde-Sossou","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Agbeko Tamakloe","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Josee Nayo-Apetsianyi","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Simon-Pierre Hamadi Assane","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mireille Prince-David","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Sossinou Marcel Awoussi","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mohaman Djibril","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Moustafa Mijiyawa","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Anoumou Claver Dagnra","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Didier Koumavi Ekouevi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169722","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality risk in a nationwide seroepidemiological study","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169722","rel_abs":"The magnitude of the infection fatality risk (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 remains under debate.

Our IFR estimates for SARS-CoV-2 are substantially greater than IFR estimators for seasonal influenza, justifying the implementation of special public health measures.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Pastor-Barriuso","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Perez-Gomez","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Hernan","author_inst":"Chan School of Public Health, Harvard"},{"author_name":"Mayte Perez-Olmeda","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Raquel Yotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Jesus Oteo","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Sanmartin","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Inmaculada Leon-Gomez","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Aurora Fernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez-Navarro","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Israel Cruz","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Mariano Martin","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Concepcion Delgado-Sanz","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Nerea Fernandez de Larrea","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Jose Leon Paniagua","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Juan Fernando Munoz-Montalvo","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Faustino Blanco","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Amparo Larrauri","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marina Pollan","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marina Pollan","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Mireille Prince-David","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Sossinou Marcel Awoussi","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mohaman Djibril","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Moustafa Mijiyawa","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Anoumou Claver Dagnra","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Didier Koumavi Ekouevi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169813","rel_title":"Outcome of Conservative Therapy in COVID-19 Patients Presenting with Gastrointestinal Bleeding","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169813","rel_abs":"Background: There is a paucity of data on the management of gastrointestinal(GI) bleeding in patients with COVID-19 amid concerns about the risk of transmission during endoscopic procedures.We aimed to study the outcomes of conservative treatment for GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, 24 of 1342(1.8%) patients with COVID-19, presenting with GI bleeding from 22ndApril to 22ndJuly 2020, were included. Results: The mean age of patients was 45.8+\/-12.7 years; 17(70.8%) were males; upper GI(UGI) bleeding: lower GI(LGI) 23:1. Twenty-two(91.6%) patients had evidence of cirrhosis- 21 presented with UGI bleeding while one had bleeding from hemorrhoids. Two patients without cirrhosis were presumed to have non-variceal bleeding. The medical therapy for UGI bleeding included vasoconstrictors- somatostatin in 17(73.9%) and terlipressin in 4(17.4%) patients. All patients with UGI bleeding received proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics. Packed red blood cells(PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma and platelets were transfused in 14(60.9%), 3(13.0%) and 3(13.0%), respectively. The median PRBCs transfused was 1(0-3) unit(s). The initial control of UGI bleeding was achieved in all 23 patients and none required an emergency endoscopy. At 5-day follow-up, none rebled or died. Two patients later rebled, one had intermittent bleed due to gastric antral vascular ectasia, while another had rebleed 19 days after discharge. Three(12.5%) cirrhosis patients succumbed to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure during hospital stay. Conclusion: Conservative management strategies including pharmacotherapy, restrictive transfusion strategy, and close hemodynamic monitoring can successfully manage GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients and reduce need for urgent endoscopy.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DM Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Manas Vaishnav","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anshuman Elhence","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna"},{"author_name":"Srikant Mohta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chandan Palle","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Peeyush Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mukesh Ranjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Vajpai","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Prasad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Jatin Yegurla","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anugrah Dhooria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vikas Banyal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Samagra Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajat Bansal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169565","rel_title":"Children's Anxiety and Physical Activity during COVID-19 in Relation to Prenatal Exposure to Gestational Diabetes","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169565","rel_abs":"Research goal: Assess the relationships between anxiety levels, physical activity and in utero exposure to Gestational Diabetes mellitus (GDM) in children age 9 to 15, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

GDM-exposure was assessed using electronic medical records. Results: Children who reported higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity or vigorous physical activity, reported lower anxiety symptoms. Children exposed to GDM in utero reported higher anxiety scores and lower engagement in vigorous physical activity compared to unexposed children. Moreover, the pathway through which children exposed to GDM in utero, reported higher anxiety was partially explained by reduced engagement in vigorous physical activity (75%, p=0.05). Conclusions: Engaging in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may be beneficial for reducing anxiety, particularly among children exposed to GDM in utero, who are at increased risk for adverse psychological outcomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasmin Alves","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Alexandra G Yunker","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Alexis DeFendis","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Anny H Xiang","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Southern California"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A Page","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Chandan Palle","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Peeyush Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mukesh Ranjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Vajpai","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Prasad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Jatin Yegurla","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anugrah Dhooria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vikas Banyal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Samagra Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajat Bansal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169409","rel_title":"Public perceptions and preventive behaviours during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparative study between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169409","rel_abs":"Background: In the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of COVID-19 relies on population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions, which is driven by their risk perception, anxiety level and knowledge. There may also be regional discrepancies in these drivers due to different historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. As such, this study compared psycho-behavioral responses in two regions during the early phase of the pandemic. Methods: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of each respective epidemic. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including interaction terms to quantify regional differences, were used to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing measures. Results: Data of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity differed by region (HK: 97.5%; UK: 20.7%). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally\/borderline anxious (HK:64.8%; UK:45.9%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.4-93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by region. In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as 'high' were more likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as 'easy' were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary by region. Discussion: These results suggest that health officials should ascertain and consider baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be done through suitable media channels - and trust should be maintained - while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leigh Bowman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kin On Kwok","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rozlyn Redd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Yi","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Helen Ward","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wan In Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Christina J Atchison","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Samuel Yeung Shan Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Vajpai","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Prasad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Jatin Yegurla","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anugrah Dhooria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vikas Banyal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Samagra Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajat Bansal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169870","rel_title":"BEHAVIORAL CHANGES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY IN SINGAPORE","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169870","rel_abs":"Introduction: As part of infection control measures for COVID-19, individuals have been encouraged to adopt both preventive (e.g., handwashing) and avoidant behavioural changes (e.g., avoiding crowds). In this study, we examined whether demographics predicted the likelihood that a person would adopt these behaviours in Singapore. Materials and Methods: 1145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March - 21 April 2020. As part of the survey, we collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the outbreak. We ran regression models to predict, using demographic information: (1) the total number of behavioural changes undertaken, (2) the number of preventive changes undertaken, and (3) the number of avoidant changes undertaken. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who: (4) declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. Results: Females and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours: whereas females were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Females and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours, with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual. Females also voluntarily reduced physical contact, whereas those who were married chose outdoor venues and relied on online shopping. Conclusion: Our characterisation of behavioural changes provides a baseline for public health advisories. Moving forward, local health authorities can focus their efforts to encourage segments of the population who do not readily adopt infection control measures against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victoria JE Long","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jean CJ Liu","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Rozlyn Redd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Yi","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Helen Ward","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wan In Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Christina J Atchison","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Samuel Yeung Shan Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Vajpai","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Prasad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Jatin Yegurla","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anugrah Dhooria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vikas Banyal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Samagra Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajat Bansal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.239574","rel_title":"Generation of tonsil organoids as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.239574","rel_abs":"Palatine tonsil (hereinafter referred to as \"tonsil\") plays role in the immune systems first line of defense against foreign pathogens.

Using an optimized protocol, we achieved 3D tonsil organoid culture from human tonsil tissue that reflects the distinctive characteristics of the tonsil epithelium, such as its cellular composition, histologic properties, and molecular biological features. Notably, we verified that SARS-CoV-2 can infect tonsil organoids with a robust replication efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with remdesivir, an antiviral agent, effectively protected them from viral infection. Therefore, tonsil organoids could be available for investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated pathology and for preclinical screening of novel antiviral drug candidates.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryThis study established tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids and demonstrated their feasibility as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Han Kyung Kim","author_inst":"CHA University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyeryeon Kim","author_inst":"Konkuk University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Myoung Kyu Lee","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Woo Hee Choi","author_inst":"CHA University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yejin Jang","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jin Soo Shin","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun-Yeol Park","author_inst":"CHA University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kang Hyun Kim","author_inst":"CHA University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyun Wook Han","author_inst":"CHA University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Meehyein Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Young Chang Lim","author_inst":"Konkuk University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jongman Yoo","author_inst":"CHA University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vikas Banyal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Samagra Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajat Bansal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.240796","rel_title":"Expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in human airway epithelial cells under physiological and pathological conditions: Implications for SARS-CoV2 infection","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.240796","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 enters into human airway epithelial cells via membrane fusion or endocytosis, and this process is dependent on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L.

By reanalyzing 54 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3428 samples, this study revealed that i) smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; ii) infection of rhinovirus as well as poly(I:C) stimulation leads to high expression of all three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes; iii) expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L in nasal epithelial cells are decreased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Critical to the rapid evaluation of vaccines and antivirals is the development of tractable animal models of infection. The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses with hACE2 induction. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. The functional identification of these T cell epitopes will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2. The use of this tractable expression system has the potential to be used in other instances of emerging infections in which the rapid development of an animal model is hindered by a lack of host susceptibility factors.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariah Hassert","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Geerling","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"E.

As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and likely underwent a recombination event in an intermediate host prior to entry into human populations. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 14 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Fagre","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Juliette Lewis","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Miles Eckley","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Shijun Zhan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Savannah M Rocha","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Nicole R Sexton","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Bradly Burke","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Brian J Geiss","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Olve Peersen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Kading","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Joel Rovnak","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Ebel","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Ronald B Tjalkens","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tawfik Aboellail","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tony Schountz","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.05.20168666","rel_title":"Paediatric Attendances and Acuity in the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-08-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.05.20168666","rel_abs":"Aim: To investigate the difference in both numbers and acuity of presentations to the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) during the peak time period of the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Design: This single centre retrospective observational study used routinely collected electronic health data to compare patient presentation characteristics between 21st March and 26th April 2020 compared to the equivalent time period in 2019. Results: There was a 90% decrease in attendances to PED, with a 10.23% reduction re-attendance rate. Children presenting were younger during the pandemic, with a median age difference of 2 years. They were more likely to present in an ambulance (9.63%), be admitted to hospital (5.75%) and be assigned the highest two Manchester triage categories (6.26%). There was a non-significant trend towards longer lengths of stay. The top 10 presenting complaints remained constant (although the order changed) between time periods. There was no difference in mortality or admission to PICU. Implications: Our data demonstrates that there has been a significant decrease in numbers of children seeking emergency department care. It suggests that presenting patients were proportionally sicker during the pandemic; however, we would argue that this is more in keeping with appropriate acuity for PED presentations, as there were no differences in PICU admission rate or mortality. We explore some of the possible reasons behind the decrease in presentations and the implications for service planning ahead of the winter months.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katy Rose","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kerry Van-Zyl","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rachel Cotton","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Susan Wallace","author_inst":"Chealsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Francesca Cleugh","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicole R Sexton","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Bradly Burke","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Brian J Geiss","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Olve Peersen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Kading","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Joel Rovnak","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Ebel","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Ronald B Tjalkens","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tawfik Aboellail","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tony Schountz","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20168187","rel_title":"An improved methodology for estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20168187","rel_abs":"Since the identification of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in December 2019, there have been more than 17 million cases of the disease in 216 countries worldwide. Comparisons of prevalence estimates between different communities can inform policy decisions regarding safe travel between countries, help to assess when to implement (or remove) disease control measures and identify the risk of over-burdening healthcare providers. Estimating the true prevalence can, however, be challenging because officially reported figures are likely to be significant underestimates of the true burden of COVID-19 within a community. Previous methods for estimating the prevalence fail to incorporate differences between populations (such as younger populations having higher rates of asymptomatic cases) and so comparisons between, for example, countries, can be misleading. Here, we present an improved methodology for estimating COVID-19 prevalence. We take the reported number of cases and deaths (together with population size) as raw prevalence for the population. We then apply an age-adjustment to this which allows the age-distribution of that population to influence the case-fatality rate and the proportion of asymptomatic cases. Finally, we calculate the likely underreporting factor for the population and use this to adjust our prevalence estimate further. We use our method to estimate the prevalence for 166 countries (or the states of the United States of America, hereafter referred to as US state) where sufficient data were available. Our estimates show that as of the 30th July 2020, the top three countries with the highest estimated prevalence are Brazil (1.26%, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.37), Kyrgyzstan (1.10%, 95% CI: 0.82 - 1.19) and Suriname (0.58%, 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.63). Brazil is predicted to have the largest proportion of all the current global cases (30.41%, 95%CI: 27.52 - 30.84), followed by the USA (14.52%, 95%CI: 14.26 - 16.34) and India (11.23%, 95%CI: 11.11 - 11.24). Amongst the US states, the highest prevalence is predicted to be in Louisiana (1.07%, 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.12), Florida (0.90%, 95% CI: 0.86 - 0.94) and Mississippi (0.77%, 95% CI: 0.74 - 0.81) whereas amongst European countries, the highest prevalence is predicted to be in Montenegro (0.47%, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.50), Kosovo (0.35%, 95% CI: 0.29 - 0.37) and Moldova (0.28%, 95% CI: 0.23 - 0.30). Our results suggest that Kyrgyzstan (0.04 tests per predicted case), Brazil (0.04 tests per predicted case) and Suriname (0.29 tests per predicted case) have the highest underreporting out of the countries in the top 25 prevalence. In comparison, Israel (34.19 tests per predicted case), Bahrain (19.82 per predicted case) and Palestine (9.81 tests per predicted case) have the least underreporting. The results of this study may be used to understand the risk between different geographical areas and highlight regions where the prevalence of COVID-19 is increasing most rapidly. The method described is quick and easy to implement. Prevalence estimates should be updated on a regular basis to allow for rapid fluctuations in disease patterns.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Virag Patel","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Catherine McCarthy","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Rachel A Taylor","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Ruth Moir","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Louise A Kelly","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Emma L Snary","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Bradly Burke","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Brian J Geiss","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Olve Peersen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Kading","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Joel Rovnak","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Ebel","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Ronald B Tjalkens","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tawfik Aboellail","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tony Schountz","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20168583","rel_title":"COVID-19: Beliefs in misinformation in the Australian community","rel_date":"2020-08-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20168583","rel_abs":"Objectives: To investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation and examine whether demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these beliefs, and how they change over time.

Participants: Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362 baseline\/Wave 1; n=1882 Wave 2; n=1369 Wave 3). Main outcome measure: COVID-19 misinformation beliefs. Results: Stronger agreement with misinformation beliefs was significantly associated with younger age, male gender, lower education, and primarily speaking a language other than English at home (all p<0.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (p<0.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific institutions. The belief that the threat of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated increased between Wave 1-2 (p=0.002), while belief that herd immunity benefits were being covered up decreased (p<0.001). Greatest support from a list of Australian Government identified myths was for those regarding hot temperatures killing the virus (22%) and Ibuprofen exacerbates COVID-19 (13%). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with greater support for COVID-19 myths after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Conclusion: These findings highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness. Stronger endorsement of misinformation was associated with male gender, younger age, lower education and language other than English spoken at home. Misinformation can undermine public health efforts. Public health authorities must urgently target groups identified in this study when countering misinformation and seek ways to enhance public trust of experts, governments, and institutions.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Erin Cvejic","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tessa Copp","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carissa Bonner","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Julie Leask","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Julie Ayre","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carys Batcup","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rachael Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MJ Isautier","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tawfik Aboellail","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tony Schountz","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Sulagna Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Richa Aggarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kapil D Soni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Swetha Rudravaram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh K Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Irfan Altaf","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Avinash Choudekar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Soumya J Mahapatra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gunjan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Kedia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anjan Trikha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anoop Saraya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20154203","rel_title":"Safety of hot and cold site admissions within a high volume urology department in the United Kingdom at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-08-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20154203","rel_abs":"Importance: Contracting COVID-19 peri-operatively has been associated with a mortality rate as high as 23%.

Objective: The primary objective was to determine the safety of the continuation of surgical admissions and procedures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic using hot and cold surgical sites. The secondary objective is to determine risk factors of contracting COVID-19 to help guide further prevention. Setting: A single surgical department at a tertiary care referral centre in London, United Kingdom. Participants: All consecutive patients admitted under the care of the urology team over a 3-month period from 1st March to 31st May 2020 over both hot acute admission sites and cold elective sites were included. Exposures: COVID-19 was prevalent in the community over the three months of the study at the height of the pandemic. The majority of elective surgery was carried out in a cold site requiring patients to have a negative COVID-19 swab 72 hours prior to admission and to self-isolate for 14 days pre-operatively, whilst all acute admissions were admitted to the hot site. Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 was detected in 1.6% of post-operative patients. There was 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Results: A total of 611 patients, 451 (73.8%) male and 160 (26.2%) female, with a median age of 57 (interquartile range 44-70) were admitted under the surgical team. Of these, 101 (16.5%) were admitted on the cold site and 510 (83.5%) on the hot site. Surgical procedures were performed in 495 patients of which 8 (1.6%) contracted COVID-19 post-operatively with 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Overall, COVID-19 was detected in 20 (3.3%) patients with 2 (0.3%) deaths. On multivariate analysis, length of stay was associated with contracting COVID-19 in our cohort (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuation of surgical procedures using hot and cold sites throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was safe practice, although the risk of COVID-19 remained and is underlined by a post-operative mortality. Reducing length of stay may be able to reduce contraction of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":60,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke Stroman","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Beth

American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA) included in three waves of a phone survey to estimate the monthly household food insecurity (HFI) prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Design We examined the reliability and internal validity of the ELCSA scale in three repeated waves of a cross-sectional surveys with Rasch models. We estimated the monthly prevalence of food insecurity in the general population and in households with and without children, and compared them with a national 2018 survey. We tested concurrent validity by testing associations of HFI with socioeconomic status and anxiety. Setting ENCOVID-19 is a monthly telephone cross-sectional survey collecting information on the well-being of Mexican households during the pandemic lockdown. Surveys used probabilistic samples and we used data from April (n=833), May (n=850), and June 2020 (n=1,674). Participants Mexicans 18 years or older who had a mobile telephone. Results ELCSA had adequate model fit and HFI was associated, within each wave, with more poverty and anxiety. The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an important reduction in food security; decreasing stepwise from 38.9% in 2018 to 24.9% in June 2020 in households with children. Conclusions Telephone surveys are a feasible strategy to monitor food insecurity with ELCSA.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pablo Gaitan-Rossi","author_inst":"Universidad Iberoamericana"},{"author_name":"Mireya Vilar-Compte","author_inst":"Universidad Iberoamericana"},{"author_name":"Graciela Teruel","author_inst":"Universidad Iberoamericana"},{"author_name":"Rafael Perez-Escamilla","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Luis Ribeiro","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Bethany Jackson","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Vugar Ismaylov","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Adeoye Oluwakanyinsola Debo-Aina","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Findlay MacAskill","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Francesca Kum","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Meghana Kulkarni","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Raveen Sandher","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Anna Walsh","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Ella Doerge","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Katherine Guest","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Yamini Kailash","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Nick Simson","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Cassandra R McDonald","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Elsie Mensah","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Li June Tay","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Ramandeep Chalokia","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Sharon Clovis","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Eversden","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Jane Cossins","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Jonah Rusere","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Grace Zisengwe","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Louisa Fleure","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Leslie Cooper","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Chatterton","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Amelia Barber","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Catherine Roberts","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Thomasia Azavedo","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Ritualo","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Harold Omana","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Liza Mills","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Lily Studd","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Oussama El Hage","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Nair","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Sachin Malde","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Arun Sahai","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Archana Fernando","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Claire Taylor","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Ben Challacombe","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Thurairaja","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Rick Popert","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Jonathon Olsburgh","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Paul Cathcart","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Christian Brown","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Marios Hadjipavlou","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Ella Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bultitude","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Jonathon Glass","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Tet Yap","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Rhana Zakri","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Majed Shabbir","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Susan Willis","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Kay Thomas","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Tim O'Brien","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Shamim Khan","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Prokar Dasgupta","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nutrition"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20168237","rel_title":"Short-term change in air pollution following the COVID-19 state of emergency: A national analysis for the United States","rel_date":"2020-08-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20168237","rel_abs":"Lockdown measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic produced sudden social and economic changes. We examined the extent of air pollution reduction that was attained under these extreme circumstances, whether these reductions occurred everywhere in the US, and the local factors that drove them. Employing counterfactual time series analysis based on seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, we found that these extreme lockdown measures led to a reduction in the weekly PM2.5 average by up to 3.4 micrograms per cubic meter and the weekly NO2 average by up to 11 ppb. These values represent a substantial fraction of the annual mean NAAQS values of 12 micrograms per cubic meter and 53 ppb, respectively. We found evidence of a statistically significant decline in NO2 concentrations following the state-level emergency declaration in almost all states. However, statistically significant declines in PM2.5 occurred mostly in the West Coast and the Northeast. Certain states experienced a decline in NO2 but an increase in PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that these two pollutants arise from dissimilar sources in these states. Finally, we found evidence that states with a higher percentage of mobile source emissions prior to the emergency measures experienced a greater decline in NO2 levels during the pandemic. Although the current social and economic restrictions are not sustainable, our results provide a benchmark to estimate the extent to which air pollution reductions can be achieved. We also identify factors that contributed to the magnitude of pollutant reductions, which can help guide future state-level policies to sustainably reduce air pollution.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pooja Tyagi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Danielle Braun","author_inst":"Harvard

However, the extraordinary complexity of the disease and the lack of knowledge about the pandemic (i.e. R value, mortality rate, etc.) create uncertainty about the accuracy of these estimates. However, several elegant mathematical approaches, based on physics and probability principles, like the Delta-t argument, Lindy's Law or the Doomsday principle-Carter's catastrophe, which have been successfully applied by scientists to unravel complex phenomena characterized by their great uncertainty (i.e. Human race's longevity; How many more humans will be born before extinction) allow predicting parameters of the Covid-19 pandemic. These models predict that the COVID-19 pandemic will hit us until at least September-October 2021, but will likely last until January-September 2022, causing a minimum of 36,000,000 infected and most

ensuring the fit of sealing face masks such as N95 and FFP3 masks. Increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortages in testing equipment and has forced many institutions to abandon fit testing. Three key materials are required for qualitative fit testing: the test solution, nebulizer, and testing hood. Accessible alternatives to the testing solution have been studied. This exploratory qualitative study evaluates alternatives to the nebulizer and hoods for performing qualitative fit testing. Methods: Four devices were trialled to replace the test kit nebulizer. Two enclosures were tested for their ability to replace the test hood. Three researchers evaluated promising replacements under multiple mask fit conditions to assess functionality and accuracy. Results: The aroma diffuser and smaller enclosures allowed participants to perform qualitative fit tests quickly and with high accuracy. Discussion & Conclusion: Aroma diffusers show significant promise in their ability to allow individuals to quickly, easily, and inexpensively perform qualitative fit testing. Our findings indicate that aroma diffusers and homemade testing hoods may allow for qualitative fit testing when conventional apparatus is unavailable. Additional research is needed to evaluate the safety and reliability of these devices.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eugenia O'Kelly","author_inst":"Cambridge University,

reinforced the need to develop epidemiological models capable of describing the progression of the disease to be of use in the formulation of mitigation policies. Here, this problem is addressed using a metapopulation approach to show that the delay in the transmission of the spread between different subsets of the total population, can be incorporated into a SIR framework through a time-dependent transmission rate. Thus, the reproduction number decreases with time despite the population dynamics remains uniform and the depletion of susceptible individuals is small. The obtained results are consistent with the early subexponential growth observed in the cumulated number of confirmed cases even in the absence of containment measures. We validate our model by describing the evolution of the COVID-19 using real data from different countries with an emphasis in the case of Mexico and show that it describes correctly also the long-time dynamics of the spread. The proposed model yet simple is successful at describing the onset and progression of the outbreak and considerably improves accuracy of predictions over traditional compartmental models. The insights given here may probe be useful to forecast the extent of the public health risks of epidemics and thus improving public policy-making aimed at reducing such risks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos I Mendoza","author_inst":"National Autonomous University of Mexico"},{"author_name":"Anmol Arora","author_inst":"University of

The asymmetry accounts for lockdown effects introduced to reduce the impact of the epidemic outburst. A set of new variables allows for an analytic study of the evolution of the system before and after the lockdown measures are put in place. A continuous matching is possible for all variables in the system apart from the time dependence of the infection rate.

been struggling to control the COVID-19 pandemic despite imposing months of lockdown and other public health measures (as of June 30, 2020). In-depth epidemiological information from these countries is lacking. From the perspective of Bangladesh, this study aims to understand the epidemiological features and gaps in public health preparedness. Method This study used publicly available data (8 March-30 June 2020) from the respective health departments of Bangladesh and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Centre. Descriptive statistics was used to report the incidence, case fatality rates (CFR), and trend analysis. Spatial distribution maps were created using ArcGIS Desktop. Infection dynamics were analyzed via SIR models. Findings In 66 days of nationwide lockdown and other public health efforts, a total of 47,153 cases and 650 deaths were reported. However, the incidence was increased by around 50% within a week after relaxing the lockdown. Males were disproportionately affected in terms of infections (71%) and deaths (77%) than females. The CFR for males was higher than females (1.38% vs 1.01%). Over 50% of infected cases were reported among young adults (20-40-year age group). Geospatial analysis between 7 June 2020 and 20 June 2020 showed that the incidences increased 4 to 10-fold in 12 administrative districts while it decreased in the epicenter. As compared to the EU and USA, trends of the cumulative incidence were slower in South Asia with lower mortality. Conclusion Our findings on gaps in public health preparedness and epidemiological characteristics would contribute to facilitating better public health decisions for managing current and future pandemics like COVID-19 in the settings of developing countries.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

We use an SEIR agent-based model on a graph, with realistic epidemiological parameters. Simulating variations in certain parameters of Testing & Tracing, we find that important determinants of successful containment are: (i) the time from symptom onset until a patient is self-isolated and tested, and (ii) the share of contacts of a positive patient who are successfully traced. Comparatively less important is (iii) the time of test analysis and contact tracing. When the share of contacts successfully traced is higher, the Test & Trace Time rises somewhat in importance. These results are robust to a wide range of values for how infectious presymptomatic patients are, to the amount of asymptomatic patients, to the network degree distribution and to base epidemic growth rate. We also provide mathematical arguments for why these simulation results hold in more general settings. Since real world Test & Trace systems and policies could affect all three parameters, Symptom Onset to Test Time should be considered, alongside test turnaround time and contact tracing coverage, as a key determinant of Test & Trace success.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ofir Reich","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Md Mahbub Hasan","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Enayetur Raheem","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

We examined the progression of COVID-19 in four island nations that fared well over the first three months of the pandemic: New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, and Taiwan. Using Bayesian phylodynamic methods, we estimated the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in the four islands as 1-1.4 during early stages of the pandemic, and show that it declined below 1 as human movement was restricted. Our reconstruction of COVID-19's phylogenetic history indicated that this disease was introduced many times into each island, and that introductions slowed down markedly when the borders closed. Finally, we found that New Zealand clusters identified via standard health surveillance largely agreed with those defined by genomic data. Our findings can assist public health decisions in countries with circulating SARS-CoV-2, and support efforts to mitigate any second waves or future epidemics.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jordan Douglas","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Fabio K Mendes","author_inst":"Centre for Computational
