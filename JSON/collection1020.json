Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single \"ensemble\" forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S. Methods Beginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths. Results Analysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96% of observations falling within the rounded 95% prediction intervals. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons. Careful development, assessment, and communication of ensemble forecasts can provide reliable insight to public health decision makers.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evan L Ray","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Nutcha Wattanachit","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Jarad Niemi","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Abdul Hannan Kanji","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Katie House","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Estee Y Cramer","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Johannes Bracher","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andrew Zheng","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Teresa K Yamana","author_inst":"Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Spencer Woody","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Yuanjia Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Lily Wang","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Robert L Walraven","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Vishal Tomar","author_inst":"Auquan Ltd"},{"author_name":"Katherine Sherratt","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041). In conclusion, our study found suggestive evidence of association between vitamin D and the risk or severity of COVID-19 but further studies are needed.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xue Li","author_inst":"School of Public Health and the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jos van Geffen","author_inst":"Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), De Bilt, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Michiel van Weele","author_inst":"Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), De Bilt, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Xiangrui Meng","author_inst":"Vanke School of public Health,Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"XIAOMENG ZHANG","author_inst":"Usher Institute"},{"author_name":"Yazhou He","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Maria Timofeeva","author_inst":"DIAS, Danish Institute for Advanced Study, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Harry Campbell","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Dunlop","author_inst":"Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lina Zgaga","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Population Health, Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Evropi Theodoratou","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Yuanjia Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Lily Wang","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Robert L Walraven","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Vishal Tomar","author_inst":"Auquan Ltd"},{"author_name":"Katherine Sherratt","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas City, KS as a proof of concept.   Results At TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral\/bacterial filter combination. Conclusion The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiv Dalla","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Shinde","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Jack M Ayres","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Waller","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Nachtigal","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yazhou He","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Maria Timofeeva","author_inst":"DIAS, Danish Institute for Advanced Study, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Harry Campbell","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Dunlop","author_inst":"Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lina Zgaga","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Population Health, Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Evropi Theodoratou","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Yuanjia Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Lily Wang","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Robert L Walraven","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Vishal Tomar","author_inst":"Auquan Ltd"},{"author_name":"Katherine Sherratt","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors of mortality that yield high accuracy and consistency to optimize patient treatment strategy. This study uses machine learning methods to identify a powerful combination of five features that help predict mortality with 96% accuracy: neutrophils, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and age. Various machine learning algorithms have been compared to achieve a consistent high accuracy across the days that span the disease. Robust testing with three cases confirm the strong predictive performance of the proposed model. The model predicts with an accuracy of 90% as early as 16 days before the outcome. This study would help accelerate the decision making process in healthcare systems for focused medical treatments early and accurately.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshaya Karthikeyan","author_inst":"Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Akshit Garg","author_inst":"Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"P K Vinod","author_inst":"Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"U.

However time of starting steroid and dose tailored to severity remains a matter of inquiry due to still emerging evidences and wide-ranging concerns of benefits and harms. We did a retrospective record analysis in an apex teaching hospital ICU setting to explore optimal doses and duration of steroid therapy which minimizes the hazard of death. Methodology: 114 adults with COVID19-ARDS admitted to ICU between 20thMarch-15thAugust2020 were included in chart review. We did preliminary exploratory analysis(rooted in steroid therapy matrix categorized by dose and duration) to understand the effect of several covariates on survival. This was followed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportion hazard regression analysis and model diagnostics. Results: Exploratory analysis and visualization indicated age, optimal steroid, severity (measured in P\/F) of disease and infection status as potential covariates for survival. Univariate cox regression analysis showed significant positive association of age>60 years{2.6 (1.5-4.7)} and protective effect of optimum steroid{0.38(0.2-0.72)} on death (hazard) in critically ill patients. Multivariate cox regression analysis after adjusting effect of age showed protective effect of optimum steroid on hazard defined as death {0.46(0.23-0.87),LR=17.04,(p=2e-04)}.The concordance was 0.70 and model diagnostics fulfilled the assumption criteria for proportional hazard model.

SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly evolving pandemic causing great morbimortality. Medical therapy with hydroxicloroquine, azitromycin and protease inhibitors is being empirically used, with reported data of QTc interval prolongation. Our aim is to assess QT interval behaviour in a not critically ill and not monitored cohort of patients. Design. We evaluated admitted and ambulatory patients with COVID-19 patients with 12 lead electrocardiogram at 48 hours after treatment initiation. Other clinical and analytical variables were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the magnitude of the QT interval prolongation under treatment and to identify clinical, analytical and electrocardiographic risk markers of QT prolongation independent predictors. Results. We included 219 patients (mean age of 63.6 +\/- 17.4 years, 48.9% were women and 16.4% were outpatients. The median baseline QTc was 416 ms (IQR 404-433), and after treatment QTc was prolonged to 423 ms (405-438) (P < 0.001), with an average increase of 1.8%. Most of the patients presented a normal QTc under treatment, with only 31 cases (14,1 %) showing a QTc interval > 460 ms, and just one case with QTc > 500 ms. Advanced age, longer QTc basal at the basal ECG and lower potassium levels were independent predictors of QTc interval prolongation. Conclusions. Ambulatory and not critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and\/or antiretrovirals develop a significant, but not relevant, QT interval prolongation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan J Jaimez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Rosa Macias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Francisco Bermudez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rubini","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alvarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Luis Tercedor","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Juan Diego Mediavilla","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Jessica Ramirez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Concepcino Morales","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Paula Flores","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Sagar Khadanga","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Arun Mitra","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Mehmet DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Erciyes University"},{"author_name":"Filiz BASINOGLU","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Darica Farabi Teaching and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nurhan SEYAHI","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa"},{"author_name":"Gizem DINLER DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Levent DOGANAY","author_inst":"University of Health Sciences, Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

All structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied, and whenever experimental structural data of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not available, homology models were built based on solved SARS-CoV structures. Several potential allosteric or protein-protein interaction druggable sites on different viral targets were identified, knowledge that could be used to expand current drug discovery endeavors beyond the cysteine proteases and the polymerase complex.

Mixed guidance exists on the aerosol generating potential of orthodontic procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate aerosol and\/or splatter contamination during an orthodontic debonding procedure. Material and Methods: Fluorescein dye was introduced into the oral cavity of a mannequin. Orthodontic debonding was carried out in triplicate with filter papers placed in the immediate environment. Composite bonding cement was removed using a slow-speed handpiece with dental suction. A positive control condition included a high-speed air-turbine crown preparation. Samples were analysed using digital image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis. Results: Contamination across the 8-metre experimental rig was 3% of the positive control on spectrofluorometric analysis and 0% on image analysis. There was contamination of the operator, assistant, and mannequin, representing 8%, 25%, and 28% of the positive control spectrofluorometric measurements, respectively. Discussion: Orthodontic debonding produces splatter within the immediate locality of the patient. Widespread aerosol generation was not observed. Conclusions: Orthodontic debonding procedures are low risk for aerosol generation, but localised splatter is likely. This highlights the importance of personal protective equipment for the operator, assistant, and patient.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hayley Llandro","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"James Allison","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Currie","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"David Edwards","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Bowes","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Jakubovics","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Nadia Rostami","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Keping Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bolin Cheng","author_inst":"Jianxuan Business Center"},{"author_name":"Feng Qiu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenting Zhou","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lei Cao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shengli Bi","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zheng","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"dentistry and oral medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20178509","rel_title":"Lockdown, relaxation, and ACME period in COVID-19: A study of disease dynamics on Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20178509","rel_abs":"Lockdown and social distancing measures have been implemented for many countries to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming of health services. However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. A Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early ACME around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, results concerning relaxation dynamics showed that the ACME levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities as well as the individual behavior with respect to prevention measures. Analysis regarding different relaxing mitigation measures were provided to the Sonoran Health Ministry, as requested. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the ACME occurring time was closed to the one given by our model. Hence, we considered that our model resulted useful for the decision-making assessment, and that an extension of it can be used for the study of a potential second wave.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayra Tocto-Erazo","author_inst":"University of Sonora"},{"author_name":"Jorge A.

Since its emergence in late December 2019 and its declaration as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease known as (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. The process of modeling and predicting the pandemic behavior became crucial as the different states needed accurate predictions to be able to adopt suitable policies to minimize the pressure on their health care systems. Researchers have employed modified variants of classical SIR\/SEIR models to describe the dynamics of this pandemic. In this paper, after proven effective in numerous countries, a modified variant of SEIR is implemented to predict the behavior of COVID-19 in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East. Methods. We built MATLAB simulations to fit the real data of COVID-19 Active, recovered and death Cases in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to the modified SEIR model via Nelder-Mead algorithm to be able to estimate the future dynamics of the pandemic. Findings. We estimate several characteristics of COVID-19 future dynamics in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. We also estimate that the pandemic will resolve in the countries under investigation in February 2021, January 2021 and 28th August 2020 with total death cases of 9,742, 5,600 and 185 and total cases of 187,600, 490,000 and 120,000 respectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed E Fahmy","author_inst":"Zewail University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mohammed M Eldesouky","author_inst":"Zewail University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmed S.A.

In our cross-sectional analysis of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases from a tertiary, eight-hospital healthcare system (Houston Methodist) across greater Houston, multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the odds of hospitalization and mortality for non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) vs. non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics. Between March 3rd and July 18th, 2020, 70,496 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 12,084 (17.1%) tested positive, of whom 3,536 (29.3%) were hospitalized. Among positive cases, NHBs and Hispanics were significantly younger than NHWs and Hispanics, respectively (mean age NHBs vs. NHWs: 46.0 vs. 51.7 year and Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic: 44.0 vs. 48.7 years). Despite younger age, NHBs (vs. NHWs) had a higher prevalence of diabetes (25.2%), hypertension (47.7%), and chronic kidney disease (5.0%). Both minority groups resided in lower median income and higher population density areas. In fully adjusted models, NHBs and Hispanics had higher likelihoods of hospitalization, aOR (CI): 1.42 (1.24-1.63) and 1.61 (1.46-1.78), respectively. No differences were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) utilization or treatment parameters. Models adjusted for demographics, vital signs, laboratory parameters, hospital complications, and ICU admission demonstrated non-significantly lower likelihoods of in-hospital mortality among NHBs and Hispanics, aOR (CI): 0.65 (0.40-1.03) and 0.89 (0.59-1.31), respectively. Our data did not demonstrate racial and ethnic differences in care provision and hospital outcomes. Higher susceptibility of racial and ethnic minorities to SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent hospitalization may be driven primarily by social determinants.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alan Pan","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Osman Khan","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Meeks","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Marc Boom","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Faisal Masud","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Julia Andrieni","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Robert Phillips","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Yordanos Tiruneh","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Bita Kash","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Farhaan Vahidy","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Bolin Cheng","author_inst":"Jianxuan Business Center"},{"author_name":"Feng Qiu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenting Zhou","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lei Cao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shengli Bi","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zheng","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.18.20177709","rel_title":"A delayed SEIQR epidemic model of COVID-19 in Tokyo","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.18.20177709","rel_abs":"The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. In order to avoid excessive restriction to the social activity, a good strategy of quarantine is needed. Several epidemic models with a quarantine compartment such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model have been applied. However, in the actual situation, the infection test and quarantine is often delayed from the beginning of the infectious stage. This article presents a delayed SEIQR model to analyze the effect of the delay of quarantine, and to suggest a guideline for the measure. The latency period (compartment E) was assumed to be 3 days, and the start of quarantine action was assumed to be delayed by 4 to 10 days from infection. The actual PCR test-positive number data from March 10th to July 18th in 2020 was analyzed to estimate a transmission rate and the basic reproduction number. The area where the infection expansion is restrained was displayed in the two parameter space (transmission rate and quarantine rate) for several possible lengths of the delay of quarantine. As a result, it was shown to be very hard to restrain the expansion of infection only by a simple quarantine action retaining the delay. As a short term measure, it was found to be necessary to reduce the transmission rate through some kind of restriction of social activity, but as a long term measure, it was found to be possible to maintain the social activity by shortening the delay of quarantine through expanding the infection test system to find earlier stage patients, including asymptomatic infectious patients. In order to shed light to this conclusion from a different viewpoint, this model was applied in another case that an additional quarantine was taken into account before the delay. The result was shown to have a similar effect as that of the shortening of the delay.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kazuo Maki","author_inst":"MediEco R&D Corporation"},{"author_name":"Osman Khan","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Meeks","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Marc Boom","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Faisal Masud","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Julia Andrieni","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Robert Phillips","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Yordanos Tiruneh","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Bita Kash","author_inst":"Houston Methodist"},{"author_name":"Farhaan Vahidy","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Bolin Cheng","author_inst":"Jianxuan Business Center"},{"author_name":"Feng Qiu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenting Zhou","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lei Cao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shengli Bi","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zheng","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178285","rel_title":"Potential interruptions in HIV prevention and treatment services for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men associated with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178285","rel_abs":"Background Globally, the coronavirus pandemic has necessitated a range of population-based measures in order to stem the spread of infection and reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 mitigation strategies and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM. Methods Data for this study were collected as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app Hornet, with data collected between April 16th, 2020 and May 24th, 2020. Data were assessed for countries where at least 50 participants completed the survey, to best evaluate country-level heterogeneity. We used a modified Poisson regression model, with clustering at the country-level, to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index; each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to school and workplace closures and travel bans. Results A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included in these analyses. The mean age was 34.2 (standard deviation: 10.8), and 12% (1264\/10540) of participants reported living with HIV. The median stringency score was 82.31 (Range:[19.44, Belarus]-[92.59, Ukraine]). For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of access to in-person testing (aPR: 0.97, 95% CI:[0.96, 0.98]), a 6% reduction in the prevalence of access to self-testing (aPR: 0.94, 95% CI:[0.93, 0.95]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 0.95, 95% CI:[0.95, 0.97]). Among those living with HIV, close to one in five (n=218\/1105) participants reported being unable to access their provider either in-person or via telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a greater proportion of interruptions to treatment services reported in Belarus and Mexico. Almost half (n=820\/1254) reported being unable to refill their HIV medicine prescription remotely. Conclusions More stringent government responses were associated with decreased access to HIV diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to facilitate minimize service interruptions to MSM communities during this and potential future waves of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amrita Rao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rucinski","author_inst":"Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Brooke Jarrett","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ackerman","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sara Wallach","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Julia Marcus","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston USA;

Methods I estimated growth rates and doubling times across a 22-week period of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic using hospital admissions incidence data collected through the US CDC COVID-NET surveillance program which operates in 98 U.S. counties located in 13 states. I cross validated the growth measures using mortality incidence data for the same regions and time periods. Results Between March 1 and August 8, 2020, two distinct waves of epidemic activity occurred. During the first wave in the COVID-NET monitoring regions, the harmonic mean of the maximum weekly growth rate was 534% (Median: 575; Range: 250 to 2250) and this maximum occurred in the second or third week of March in different regions. The harmonic mean of the minimum doubling time occurred with maximum growth rate and was 0.35 weeks (Median 0.36 weeks; Range: 0.22 to 0.55 weeks). The harmonic mean of the maximum incidence rate during the first wave of the epidemic was 8.5 hospital admissions per 100,000 people per week (Median: 9.2, Range: 4 to 40.5) and the peak of epidemic infection transmission associated with this maximum occurred on or before March 27, 2020 in eight of the 13 regions. Dividing the 22-week observed period into four intervals, the harmonic mean of the weekly hospitalization incidence rate was highest during the second interval (4.6 hospitalizations per week per 100,000), then fell during the third and fourth intervals. Growth rates declined from 101 percent per week in the first interval to 2.5 percent per week in the last. Doubling time have lengthened from 3\/5th of a week in the first interval to 12.5 weeks in the last. Period by period, the cumulative incidence has grown primarily in a linear mode. The mean cumulative incidence of hospitalizations on Aug 8th, 2020 in the COVID-NET regions is 96 hospitalizations per 100,000. Regions which experienced the highest maximum weekly incidence rates or greatest cumulative incidence rates in the first wave, generally, but not uniformly, observed the lower incidence rates in the second wave. Growth measures calculated based on mortality incidence data corroborate these findings. Conclusions Declining epidemic growth rates of SARS-COV-2 infection appeared in early March in the first observations of nationwide hospital admissions surveillance program in multiple U.S. regions. A sizable fraction of the U.S. population may have been infected in a cryptic February epidemic acceleration phase. To more accurately monitor epidemic trends and inform pandemic mitigation planning going forward, the US CDC needs measures of epidemic disease incidence that better reflect clinical disease and account for large variations in case ascertainment strategies over time.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajiv Bhatia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rucinski","author_inst":"Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Brooke Jarrett","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ackerman","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sara Wallach","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Julia Marcus","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston USA;

In this paper we have used mathematical modelling approach to study the effects of lockdowns and un-lockdowns on the pandemic evolution in India. This, study is based on SIDHARTHE model, which is an extension of classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. The SIDHARTHE model distinguish between the diagnosed and undiagnosed cases, which is very important because undiagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the virus than diagnosed individuals. We have stratified the lockdowns and un-lockdowns into seven phases and have computed the basic reproduction number R0 for each phase. We have calibrated our model results with real data from 20 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. Our results demonstrate that different strategies implemented by GoI, have delayed the peak of pandemic by approximately 100 days.

We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. Methods: We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV, the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. Results: With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to >99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. Conclusion: To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cathie Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK; Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Peter Diggle","author_inst":"University of Lancaster; Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Oliver Warlow","author_inst":"Ventient Energy"},{"author_name":"David Seymour","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Ben Gordon","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Rhos Walker","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Charles Warlow","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alex Garner","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Glenn-Milo Santos","author_inst":"Community Health Systems Department, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, USA; Center of Public Health Research, San Francisco Department of P"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Sean Howell","author_inst":"Hornet, San Francisco, USA"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenting Zhou","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lei Cao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shengli Bi","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zheng","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178343","rel_title":"The Effects of Coronavirus Victimization Distress and Coronavirus Racial Bias on Mental Health Among Black, Indigenous and Latinx Young Adults in the United States","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178343","rel_abs":"Background. People of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of young adult people of color. Method. An online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and Latinx adults (18 to 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias. Results. Employment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health measures across all groups. Conclusions. Results suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial\/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Celia B.

We aimed to chronicle the prevalence and correlations of symptoms and comorbidities, and associated covariates among the patients. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis [PROSPERO registration: CRD42020182677]. Databases [PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, WHO, Semantic Scholar, and COVID-19 Primer] were searched for clinical studies published in English from January 1 to April 20, 2020. The pooled prevalence of symptoms and comorbidities were identified using the random effect model, and sub-groups analysis of patients age and locations were investigated. A multivariable factor analysis was also performed to show the correlation among symptoms, comorbidities and age of the COVID-19 patients. Findings: Twenty-nine articles [China (24); Outside of China (5)], with 4,884 COVID-19 patients were included in this systematic review. The meta-analysis investigated 33 symptoms, where fever [84%], cough\/dry cough [61%], and fatigue\/weakness [42%] were found frequent. Out of 43 comorbidities investigated, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [61%] was a common condition, followed by hypertension [23%] and diabetes [12%]. According to the patients age, the prevalence of symptoms like fatigue\/weakness, dyspnea\/shortness of breath, and anorexia were highly prevalent in older adults [[&ge;]50 years] than younger adults [<50 years]. Diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and COPD\/lung disease were more prevalent comorbidities in older adults than younger adults. The patients from outside of China had significantly higher prevalence [p<0.005] of diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, sore throat, and dyspnea, and the prevalent comorbidities in that region were diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ARDS. The multivariable factor analysis showed positive association between a group of symptoms and comorbidities, and with the patients age. Interpretation: Epitomizing the correlation of symptoms of COVID-19 with comorbidities and patients age would help clinicians effectively manage the patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Meshbahur Rahman","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka-1230, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Badhan Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology, BRAC University, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Zaki Farhana","author_inst":"National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine, Mohakhali, Dhaka-1212, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hamiduzzaman","author_inst":"College of Medicine & Public Health, Flinders University, South Australia, Australia."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Abdul Bake Chowdhury","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, FL 32608, USA."},{"author_name":"Mohammad Sorowar Hossain","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka-1230, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mahbubul H Siddiqee","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka-1230, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.

The risk of within-household infection is greatly increased among those from Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and low income communities. Efforts to protect these communities are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to explore the acceptability of the availability of accommodation to support isolation among at risk populations. Methods Our study used a mixed methods design structured in two phases. In phase 1, we conducted a survey study of a sample of volunteers from our existing database of 300 individuals who had provided consent to be contacted about ongoing research projects into infection control. In phase 2, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 participants from BAME communities and low income communities recruited through social media. Results Participants from the survey and interview phase of the study viewed the provision of accommodation as important and necessary. Factors influencing likely uptake of accommodation included perceived 1) vulnerability of household 2) exposure to the virus and 3) options for isolation at home. Barriers to accepting the offer of accommodation included 1) being able to isolate at home 2) wanting to be with family 3) caring responsibilities 4) concerns about mental wellbeing 5) upheaval of moving when ill and 6) concerns about infection control. Participants raised a series of issues that should be addressed before accommodation is offered. These included questions regarding who should use temporary accommodation and at what stage to effectively reduce transmission in the home, and how infection control in temporary accommodation would be managed. Conclusion This research provides evidence that the provision of accommodation to prevent within household transmission of the virus is viewed as acceptable, feasible and necessary by many people who are concerned about infection transmission in the home. We explore ways in which accommodation might be offered.

Design Cross sectional study of three key worker groups. Setting Six acute NHS hospitals and two Police and Fire and Rescue sites in England. Participants Individuals were recruited from three streams: (A) Police and Fire and Rescue services (n=1147), (B) healthcare workers (n=1546) and (C) healthcare workers with previously positive virus detection (n=154). Main outcome measures Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma. Results 943 of the 2847 participants (33%) reported belief they had had COVID-19, having experienced compatible symptoms (including 152 from Stream C). Among individuals reporting COVID-19 compatible symptoms, 466 (49%) were seronegative on both Nucleoprotein (Roche) and Spike-protein (EUROIMMUN) antibody assays. However, among the 268 individuals with prior positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, of whom 96% reported symptoms with onset a median of 63 days (IQR 52 to 75 days) prior to venesection, Roche and EUROIMMUN assays had 96.6% (95% CI 93.7% to 98.2%) and 93.3% (95% CI 89.6% to 95.7%) sensitivity respectively. Symptomatic but seronegative individuals had significantly earlier symptom onset dates than the symptomatic seropositive individuals, shorter illness duration and a much lower anosmia reporting frequency. Conclusions Self-reported belief of COVID-19 was common among our frontline worker cohort. About half of these individuals were seronegative, despite a high sensitivity of serology in this cohort, at least in individuals with previous positive PCR results. This is compatible with non-COVID-19 respiratory disease during the COVID-19 outbreak having been commonly mistaken for COVID-19 within the key worker cohort studied.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ranya Mulchandani","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sian Taylor-Phillips","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Hayley Jones","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Tony Ades","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ray Borrow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ezra Linley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Peter Kirwan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Richard Stewart","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philippa Moore","author_inst":"Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Boyes","author_inst":"Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Anil Hormis","author_inst":"The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Todd","author_inst":"York Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Antoanela Colda","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20177667","rel_title":"How early into the outbreak can surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater tell us?","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20177667","rel_abs":"There is increasing interest to use wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as an early warning of the outbreak within a community.

To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank and biological activated sludge tank located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that > 253 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The occurrence frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 5 times lower in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank.

In the present study we described the clinical course and risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality of SARS-Cov-2 positive patients affected by acute respiratory failure, hospitalized in a Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit in the south of Italy. Methods In this retrospective, observational single centre study we evaluated 96 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients affected by acute respiratory failure (ARF). We compared demographic data, laboratory data and clinical outcomes between deceased and survived patients, aiming to identify risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality, and possible gender-related differences. Results Of 96 patients, 51 (53.1%) survived and 45 (46.9 %) died. Among those who died, 23 (51.1%) deceased in RICU. Twenty-nine (30.2%) were transferred to ICU, of whom 22 (75.9%) died in ICU. Patients affected by COPD have a higher mortality compared to patients without this comorbidity (p=0.002). Lower baseline P\/F ratio (p=0,014) and neurologic comorbidities (p=0,008) emerged as risk factors for death. Male were younger than female patients (66 vs 80 y.o.; p=0.042). In female patients, lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count (p=0.007) is a risk factor for death, characteristic gender-related in our sample. Female sex was a protective parameter against transfer to ICU (p=0,036) and P\/F ratio was not a significant predictor of transfer to ICU (p=0,227). Only higher baseline CRP (p=0,034) has shown a predictive role for transfer to ICU in our sample. Patients deceased after a transfer to ICU had younger age (p=0,000), lower median comorbidity number (p=0,000), lower D-dimer (p=0,029) and lower prevalence of female sex (p=0,029). Discussion Mortality in our study was similar to that found in other studies involving patients in non-invasive ventilation. In our study older age and comorbidities play as predictors of death in COVID-19 patients. COPD, despite presenting low prevalence, is a risk factor for death, both in men and women. In female patients chronic ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure are death predictors. High CRP and lymphopenia, linked to inflammatory status, are predictors of transfer to ICU. Patients transferred to ICU higher mortality than the others, and patients who die in ICU are mostly men, younger and have less comorbidities. Baseline P\/F ratio is not a good predictor of transfer to ICU, while in our sample is a sensible predictor of death. More studies need to be performed on COVID-19 patients, in the urgency of COVID-19 pandemic persistence.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enrico Buonamico","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vitaliano Nicola Quaranta","author_inst":"\"Di Venere\" Hospital of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Esterina Boniello","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michela Dimitri","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Majorano","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luciana Labate","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Pierucci","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Barratta","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Elisiana Carpagnano","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Onofrio Resta","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Science, Neuroscience and Sense Organs - \"Aldo Moro\" University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anil Hormis","author_inst":"The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Todd","author_inst":"York Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Antoanela Colda","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.21.261727","rel_title":"The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike is the key target of neutralizing antibody in human polyclonal sera.","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.21.261727","rel_abs":"Natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans leads to the development of a strong neutralizing antibody response, however the immunodominant targets of the polyclonal neutralizing antibody response are still unknown.

In this study, we identify the spike protein subunits that contain antigenic determinants and examine the neutralization capacity of polyclonal sera from a cohort of patients that tested qRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response. We show that epitopes within RBD are the target of a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the human polyclonal antibody response. These data provide critical information for vaccine development and development of sensitive and specific serological testing.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tara Steffen","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"E Taylor Stone","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Mariah Hassert","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Geerling","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Brian T Grimberg","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Ana M Espino","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Petraleigh Pantoja","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Consuelo Climent","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Hoft","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Sarah L George","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Sariol","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus"},{"author_name":"Amelia K Pinto","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"James D Brien","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178087","rel_title":"Pandemic Control in ECON-EPI Networks","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178087","rel_abs":"We develop an ECON-EPI network model to evaluate policies designed to improve health and economic outcomes during a pandemic.

We calibrate it to the New York metro area during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis and show three main results. First, the ECON-EPI network implies patterns of infections that better match the data compared to the standard SIR. The switching during the early phase of the pandemic from unstable to stable contacts is crucial for this result. Second, the model suggests the design of smart policies that reduce infections and at the same time boost economic activity. Third, the model shows that reopening sectors characterized by numerous and unstable contacts (such as large events or schools) too early leads to fast growth of infections.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessandra Fogli","author_inst":"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Perri","author_inst":"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis"},{"author_name":"Mark Ponder","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Marina Azzimonti","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Brian T Grimberg","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Ana M Espino","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Petraleigh Pantoja","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Consuelo Climent","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Hoft","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Sarah L George","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Sariol","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus"},{"author_name":"Amelia K Pinto","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"James D Brien","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178434","rel_title":"Estimating healthcare resource needs for COVID-19 patients in Nigeria","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178434","rel_abs":"Background: Predicting potential healthcare resource use under different scenarios will help to prepare the healthcare system for a surge in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we aim to predict the effect of COVID-19 on hospital resources in Nigeria. Method: We adopted a previously published discrete-time, individual-level, health-state transition model of symptomatic COVID-19 patients to the Nigerian healthcare system and COVID-19 epidemiology. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectories and acute care capacity. Primary outcomes included expected cumulative number of cases, days until depletion resources, and the number of deaths associated with resource constraints. Outcomes were predicted over a 60-day time horizon. Results: In our best-case epidemic trajectory, which implies successful implementation of public health measures to control COVID-19 spread, the current number of ventilator resources in Nigeria (conservative resources scenario), were expended within five days, and 901 patients may die while waiting for hospital resources in conservative resource scenario. In our expanded resource scenarios, ventilated ICU beds were depleted in all three epidemic trajectories within 60 days. Acute care resources were only sufficient in the best-case and intermediate epidemic scenarios, combined with a substantial increase in healthcare resources. Conclusion: Current hospital resources are inadequate to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Given Nigeria's limited resources, it is imperative to increase healthcare resources and maintain aggressive public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adeteju Ogunbameru","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto;

The relationship between the nasopharyngeal virus load, IgA and IgG antibodies to both the S1-RBD-protein and the N-protein as well the neutralizing activity (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of moderately afflicted COVID-19 patients has not been investigated longitudinally so far. Methods: Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed and validated for the longitudinal investigation in three patients of a family which underwent a mild course of COVID-19. Findings: We observed that the virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks, whereas serum antibodies showed a contrasting course. IgA levels to S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau approximately six weeks after disease onset. NAbs in serum reached a peak about four weeks after disease onset but dropped to a lower level about six weeks later. Interpretation: Our data establishes associations of virus neutralization and a serological immune response foremost against Sars-CoV-2 S1-RDB-protein in a longitudinal manner.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bertram Flehmig","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Tuebingen and Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Michael Schindler","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ruetalo","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Ramona Businger","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Manfred Bayer","author_inst":"4base lab AG advanced molecular analysis"},{"author_name":"Angelika Haage","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kirchner","author_inst":"Pediatric Praxis Weil der Stadt"},{"author_name":"Karin Klingel","author_inst":"Institute for Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Andrea Normann","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Lutz Pridzun","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Despina Tougianidou","author_inst":"4base lab AG advanced molecular analysis"},{"author_name":"Michael B Ranke","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"James D Brien","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178178","rel_title":"Serum neopterin levels in relation to mild and severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178178","rel_abs":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly spreading worldwide. There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol\/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol\/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol\/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol\/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol\/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol\/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in clinical praxis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Josefina Robertson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Johanna M Gostner","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Dietmar Fuchs","author_inst":"Institute of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gisslen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kirchner","author_inst":"Pediatric Praxis Weil der Stadt"},{"author_name":"Karin Klingel","author_inst":"Institute for Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Andrea Normann","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Lutz Pridzun","author_inst":"Mediagnost Gesellschaft fuer Forschung und Herstellung von Diagnostika GmbH"},{"author_name":"Despina Tougianidou","author_inst":"4base lab AG advanced molecular analysis"},{"author_name":"Michael B Ranke","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"James D Brien","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Ian Reckless","author_inst":"Milton Keynes University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Oliver","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
