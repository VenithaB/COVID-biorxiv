Methods We reported 135 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan, China. Demographic data, medical history, and laboratory parameters were taken from inpatient records and compared between patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU isolation wards for prognosis on disease severity. In particular, survivors and non-survivors upon ICU admission were compared for prognosis on disease mortality. Results For COVID-19 patients, blood test results showed more significantly deranged values in the ICU group than those in non-ICU. Among those parameters for ICU patients, myocardial variables including troponin T, creatine kinase isoenzymes, myoglobin, were found significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. Conclusions Upon hospitalization abnormal myocardial metabolism in COVID-19 patients could be prognostic indicators of a worsened outcome for disease severity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianguo Zhang","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, and The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Daoyin Ding","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Can Cao","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Zhang","author_inst":"The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Xing Huang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20091637","rel_title":"Application-oriented mathematical algorithms for group testing","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20091637","rel_abs":"Group testing is a widely used protocol which aims to test a small group of people to identify whether at least one of them is infected.

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development, and if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised in the context of other coronaviruses. CpG suppression amongst coronaviruses does not significantly differ according to genera of virus, but does vary according to host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. While ORF10 is only present in the genomes of a subset of coronaviruses, E is essential for virus replication. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. Phylogeny indicates that this is an ancestrally-derived trait reflecting their origin in bats, rather than something selected for after zoonotic transfer. Conservation of CpG motifs in these regions suggests that they have a functionality which over-rides the need to suppress CpG; an observation relevant to future strategies towards a rationally attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Digard","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Hui-Min Lee","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Colin Sharp","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Finn Grey","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Eleanor R Gaunt","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.085308","rel_title":"VIRTUS: a pipeline for comprehensive virus analysis from conventional RNA-seq data","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.085308","rel_abs":"The possibility that RNA transcripts from clinical samples contain plenty of virus RNAs has not been pursued actively so far.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular surface cells possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry\/infection.Methods We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2.Results Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. Surgical conjunctival specimens also showed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctival epithelium, especially prominent in the superficial epithelium, as well as the substantia propria. All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2. Finally, western blot analysis of protein lysates from human corneal epithelium obtained during refractive surgery confirmed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.Conclusions Together, these results indicate that ocular surface cells including conjunctiva are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and could therefore serve as a portal of entry as well as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission of this virus. This highlights the importance of safety practices including face masks and ocular contact precautions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lingli Zhou","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhenhua Xu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gianni M Castiglione","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Uri S Soiberman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles G Eberhart","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elia J Duh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.084996","rel_title":"Elevated ACE2 expression in the olfactory neuroepithelium: implications for anosmia and upper respiratory SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.084996","rel_abs":"The site of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication critically impacts strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission mitigation, and treatment.

On the 4th of March, the Italian government orders the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide.The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, practice and attitudes (KAP) of secondary school at the time of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In this cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted among the high school student population with age ranging from 14 to 19 years old, a questionnaire with 19 items regarding the KAP toward COVID-19 is asked. Study participants are recruited from several secondary schools of different areas. Frequencies and histograms are computed for descriptive purposes. Statistical analysis is computed with Chi square test, utilized to depict relevant difference between geender. Among a total of 2380 students who answers the questionnaire, 40.7% are male and 59.3% are female.Level of knowledge about generical characteristics of COVID-19 is quite similar among gender. Students present a good level of knowledge about the clinical presentation of the disease, the basic hygiene principles, the modes of transmission and the method of protection against virus transmission. The knowledge about number of this pandemia and easy scientific correlation with COVID-19 is quite confused. The most frequently reported source of knowledge about COVID-19 is television, whereas the less is the school. Our findings suggest that student population shows appropriate practice, and positive attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak.More emphasis should be placed on education of the student partecipants about biological meaning of this infection and relative preventive or future measures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"La Sapienza, Roma"},{"author_name":"Dafni Souli","author_inst":"Istituto Cine-tv Rossellini, Rome"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Rowan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heather Kulaga","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Hillel","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"scientific communication and education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088971","rel_title":"Contribution to COVID-19 spread modelling: A physical phenomenological dissipative formalism","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088971","rel_abs":"In this study, we propose an evolution law of COVID-19 transmission based first on a representation of population by a domain part of an infinite ordered lattice in which epidemic evolution is represented by a wave like free spread starting from a first case as an epicentre. Free energy of spread on a given day is defined equal to the natural logarithm of the number of infected cases. Dissipation of propagation is obtained using a postulated form of free energy built using thermodynamics of irreversible processes in analogy to isotherm wave propagation in solids and elastic damage behaviour of materials. The proposed expression of daily free energy rate leads to dissipation of propagation introducing a parameter quantifying measures taking by governments to restrict transmission. Entropy daily rate representing disorder produced in the initial system is also explicitly defined. In this context, a simple law of evolution of infected cases as function of time is given in an iterative form. The model predicts different effects on peak of infected cases Imax and epidemic period, including effects of population size N, effects of measures taking to restrict spread, effects of population density and effect of a parameter T similar to absolute temperature in thermodynamics. Different effects are presented first. The model is than applied to epidemic spread in Tunisia and compared with data registered since the report of the first confirmed case on Mar 2, 2020.

This study is to test the hypothesis that environmental surfaces played important roles in transmission for SARS-CoV-2 during this outbreak. Methods We sampled environmental surfaces including air from common areas in the cruise ship and cabins in which confirmed COVID-19 cases and non-cases had stayed after they left the cabins. We tested the samples for SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR and conducted viral isolation. Findings Of 601 samples tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 58 samples (10%) from case-cabins from which they left 1-17 days before sampling, but not from non-case-cabins. Except for one sample from an air hood in a corridor, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from samples in common areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from all 14 air samples. RNA was most often detected on the floor around toilet in the bathroom (39%, 13\/33, cycle quantification (Cq): 26.21-37.62) and bed pillow (34%, 11\/32, Cq: 34.61-38.99). There was no difference in the detection proportion between cabins for symptomatic (15%, 28\/189, Cq: 29.79-38.86) and asymptomatic cases (21%, 28\/131, Cq: 26.21-38.99). No SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from any of the samples. Interpretation The environment around the COVID-19 cases was extensively contaminated from SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19 outbreak in the cruise ship.

Using country-level data, we modeled the early growth in the number of cases for over 480 cities in all Brazilian states. As the main findings, we found that the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols was the main explanatory factor for the observed growth rate of COVID-19. Those cities that presented the highest spread of the new coronavirus were also those that had lower averages of social distancing. We also underline that total population of cities and connectivity, represented by the city-level importance to the air transportation of people across the country, plays important roles in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Climate and socioeconomic predictors had little contribution to the big-picture scenario. Our results show that different States had high variability in their growth rates, mostly due to quite different public health strategies to retain the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of all limitations of such a large-scale approach, our results underline that climatic conditions are likely weak limiting factors for the spread of the new coronavirus, and the circulation of people in the city- and country-level are the most responsible factors for the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. Moreover, we reinforce that social distancing protocols are fundamental to avoid critical scenarios and the collapse of healthcare systems.

We examined the following COVID-19 outcomes within federal penitentiaries and contrasted them with the overall population in the penitentiaries' respective provincial jurisdictions: testing, prevalence, the proportion recovered, and fatality. Methods: Data for prisons were obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada and, for the general population, from COVID-19 Esri Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub. Data were retrieved between March 30 and April 21, 2020, and are accurate to this date. Penitentiary-, province- and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated. Results: Data on 50 of 51 penitentiaries (98%) were available. Of these, 72% of penitentiaries reported fewer tests per 1000 population than the Canadian general population average (16 tests\/1000 population), and 24% of penitentiaries reported zero tests. Penitentiaries with high levels of testing were those that already had elevated COVID-19 prevalence. Five penitentiaries reported an outbreak (at least one case). Hardest hit penitentiaries were those in Quebec and British Columbia, with some prisons reporting COVID-19 prevalence of 30% to 40%. Of these, two were women's prisons. Female prisoners were over-represented among cases (31% of cases overall, despite representing 5% of the total prison population). Conclusion: Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate given the confined nature of prison populations. This, along with rigorous infection prevention control practices and the potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb current outbreaks and those likely to come.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Blair","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Abtin Parnia","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Arjumand Siddiqi","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada;  Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, C"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Dobrovolski","author_inst":"Universidade Federal da Bahia"},{"author_name":"Jose Alexandre F Diniz-Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20085902","rel_title":"CoVID-19 prediction for India from the existing data and SIR(D) model study","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20085902","rel_abs":"CoVID-19 is spreading throughout the world at an alarming rate.

Mathematical modelling of an epidemic like CoVID-19 is always useful for strategic decision making, especially it is very useful to gain some understanding of the future of the epidemic in densely populous countries like India. We use a simple yet effective mathematical model SIR(D) to predict the future of the epidemic in India by using the existing data. We also estimate the effect of lock-down\/social isolation via a time-dependent coefficient of the model. The model study with realistic parameters set shows that the epidemic will be at its peak around the end of June or the first week of July with almost 108 Indians most likely being infected if the lock-down relaxed after May 3, 2020. However, the total number of infected population will become one-third of what predicted here if we consider that people only in the red zones (approximately one-third of India's population) are susceptible to the infection. Even in a very optimistic scenario we expect that at least the infected numbers of people will be of the order of 107.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya Rajesh","author_inst":"IIT, Bhilai, India."},{"author_name":"Haidas Pai","author_inst":"SINP, Kolkata, India."},{"author_name":"Victor Roy","author_inst":"NISER, Bhubaneswar, India."},{"author_name":"Subhasis Samanta","author_inst":"Jan Kochanowski University, 25-406 Kielce, Poland"},{"author_name":"Sabyasachi Ghosh","author_inst":"IIT, Bhilai, India."},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083352","rel_title":"Correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and risk and severity of COVID-19 at the national level in the European Union: an ecological study.","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083352","rel_abs":"The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the receptor for different coronaviruses, including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We report for the first time on the natural history of COVID-19 disease from first diagnosis, including both outpatient and hospital care. Methods: Data was obtained from SIDIAP, a primary care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, hospital emergency and inpatient, and mortality registers. All participants >=15 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient between 15th March and 24th April 2020 (10th April for outcome studies) were included. Baseline characteristics, testing, and 30-day outcomes (hospitalisation for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality) were analysed. Results: A total of 121,263 and 95,467 COVID-19 patients were identified for characterisation and outcome studies, respectively. Women (57.8%) and age 45-54 (20.2%) were predominant. 44,709 were tested, with 32,976 (73.8%) PCR+. From 95,467 cases, a 14.6% [14.4-14.9] were hospitalised in the month after diagnosis, with male predominance (19.2% vs 11.3%), peaking at age 75-84.

To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group. Conclusions: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs than participants taking placebo. Precautionary measures should be taken when using these drugs to treat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Ren","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Wilson Xu","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"James L Overton","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Shandong Yu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Cardiovascular Center, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing"},{"author_name":"Nipavan Chiamvimonvat","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Phung N Thai","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Francesc Fina-Aviles","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Mencia Benitez","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Carolina Guiriguet","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Mireia Fabregas","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Manuel Medina-Peralta","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Idiap Jordi Gol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089961","rel_title":"Acute mental health responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089961","rel_abs":"The acute and long-term mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems.

Aims: To estimate the prevalence of common mental health disorders in HCWs based in hospitals where pandemic-affected patients were treated. Method: Databases were searched for studies published before 30th March 2020. Quantitative synthesis was used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental health disorders in four time windows, determined a priori (the acute phase, i.e. during and up to 1.5 months post-pandemic; 1.5-5.9 months; 6-11.9 months; 12 months and later). Results: Nineteen studies met the review criteria. They predominantly addressed the acute phase of the SARS outbreak in Asia. The most studied outcomes were clinically-significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and general psychiatric caseness. For clinically significant PTSS in the acute phase, the prevalence estimate was 23.4% (95% CI 16.3, 31.2; N=4147; I2=96.2%); in the 12 months plus window, the estimate was 11.9% (8.4, 15.8; N=1136; I2=74.3%). For general psychiatric caseness, prevalence estimates were: acute phase, 34.1% (18.7, 51.4; N=3971; I2=99.1%); 6-12 months, 17.9% (13.1, 23.2; N=223; I2=0.0%); 12 months plus, 29.3% (6.0, 61.0; N=710; I2=97.8%). Conclusions: Mental health disorders are particularly common in HCWs working with pandemic-afflicted patients immediately following a pandemic, but the course of disorders following this period is poorly understood. PTSS remained elevated compared to the general population at 12 months, despite there being some evidence for natural recovery. There was considerable heterogeneity, likely linked to methodological differences. More extended follow up of HCWs is needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie M.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional well-being. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on mental wellbeing and mood and feelings questionnaires. Methods: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the multi-languages survey through their networks to general society. Of the 64 questions, 7 were from the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), and 13 were from the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), which are both validated instruments. Results: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p<0.001 and {Delta}%= 9.4 %) in the total score of mental wellbeing was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing during compared to before home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire (i.e., depressive symptoms) showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p<0.001) in total score with more people (+10%) developing depressive symptoms during compared to before home confinement. Conclusion: The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the enforced home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":58,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ACHRAF AMMAR","author_inst":"Otto-Von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Boukhris","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marlen Schmicker","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would somewhat affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84.9% had performed [&ge;]1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93.4% performed [&ge;]1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government\/authorities (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI 3-9.0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.8-6.9) and higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Interpretation: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Holly Seale","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Anita E Heywood","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Julie Leask","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Meru Steel","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Susan Thomas","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"David N Durrheim","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Bolsewicz","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Rajneesh Kaur","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Marlen Schmicker","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

To provide scientific data to help identify risk-factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. Method: Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 [&le;] d [&le;] 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (15%) of technology solutions during the confinement period. Conclusion: These findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period and provide a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL).","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ACHRAF AMMAR","author_inst":"Otto-Von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Boukhris","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany Michael Brach"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Leipziger Str. 44, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

Analysis of data from the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important information about the potential epidemic and healthcare burdens as well as assist in evaluating the potential impact of various outbreak control measures. Such control measures are essentially implemented to achieve a sufficient reduction in the effective reproduction number during an outbreak. In this study, we use a mathematical modeling framework to simulate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait and forecast the potential burden on the healthcare system. We calibrate the model against daily numbers of detected infection and death cases using a maximum likelihood framework and estimate both the basic and effective reproduction numbers. Our results indicate that the early control measures implemented in Kuwait had the effect of delaying the intensity of the outbreak but were unsuccessful in reducing Rt below 1. This highlights a need for a systematic investigation of the current public health interventions as well as a scientific surveillance tool that is sufficiently sensitive to outbreak temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, the developed model can serve as a public health tool to control the current outbreak and can be used to anticipate effective measures should a second wave re-emerge in Kuwait.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdullah A.

Methods Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (>13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656\/677) reported a case and 49% (330\/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987\/2,465) and 28% (684\/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with <13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with >13% black residents. Conclusions Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Greg Millett","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Austin T Jones","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"David Benkeser","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stefan D Baral","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Laina Mercer","author_inst":"PATH"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brian Honnermann","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Elise Lankiewicz","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Lenandro Mena","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S Crowley","author_inst":"O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Sherwood","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19. Methods: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. We also used reported rates for morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in other regions to estimate risk at the county (Harris County) and census tract levels. Analysis: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. Then, to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. Results: Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45-65 (~4% of County population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk. The results of age-based estimations of hospitalization rates showed the western part of the County might be in greater need of hospital beds. However, cross-referencing the vulnerability model with the estimation of potential hospitalized patients showed that part of the County has the least access to medical facilities. Conclusion: Policy makers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Kiaghadi","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Hanadi S Rifai","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Winston Liaw","author_inst":"University of Houston College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan D Baral","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Laina Mercer","author_inst":"PATH"},{"author_name":"Chris Beyrer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brian Honnermann","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Elise Lankiewicz","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Lenandro Mena","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S Crowley","author_inst":"O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Sherwood","author_inst":"amfAR"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing. Methods: All patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for reporting. Results: A total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 UW, 12,543 Stanford) were performed in 20,912 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all subsequent tests performed within this window. Conclusions: Two independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed. Although it is not possible to infer the clinical sensitivity of NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing using these data, they may be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and interpretation of this common testing modality.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dustin R Long","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Hogan","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Alex L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Vikas OReilly Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chloe Bryson-Cahn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bryan Stevens","author_inst":"Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christina S Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noel S Weiss","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacob Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

It is already indicated in patients with COVID-19 and worsening respiratory status. The rapid spread of the pandemic to all continents, albeit with a nonuniform community transmission, necessitates chest imaging for medical triage of patients presenting moderate-severe clinical COVID-19 features. This paper reports the development of innovative machine learning schemes for the analysis of Chest X-Ray (CXR) scan images of COVID-19 patients in almost real-time, demonstrating significantly high accuracy in identifying COVID-19 infection. The performance testing was conducted on a combined dataset comprising CXRs of positive COVID-19 patients, patients with various viral and bacterial infections, as well as persons with a clear chest. The test resulted in successfully distinguishing CXR COVID-19 infection from the other cases with an average accuracy of 94.43%, sensitivity 95% and specificity 93.86%.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhurgham Al-karawi","author_inst":"Medical Analytica Ltd"},{"author_name":"Shakir Al-Zaidi","author_inst":"Medical Analytica Ltd"},{"author_name":"Nisreen Polus","author_inst":"Medical Analytica Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sabah Jassim","author_inst":"University of Buckingham"},{"author_name":"Vikas OReilly Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chloe Bryson-Cahn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bryan Stevens","author_inst":"Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christina S Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noel S Weiss","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacob Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

Respiratory disorders in COVID-19 caused by the virus commonly present as viral pneumonia-like opacities in chest X-ray images which are used as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. The surge places high demand on medical services including radiology expertise. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based automated decision support tools to alleviate radiological burden. We address this insufficiency by expanding training data distribution through use of weakly-labeled images pooled from publicly available CXR collections showing pneumonia-related opacities. We use the images in a stage-wise, strategic approach and train convolutional neural network-based algorithms to detect COVID-19 infections in CXRs. It is observed that weakly-labeled data augmentation improves performance with the baseline test data compared to non-augmented training by expanding the learned feature space to encompass variability in the unseen test distribution to enhance inter-class discrimination, reduce intra-class similarity and generalization error. Augmentation with COVID-19 CXRs from individual collections significantly improves performance compared to baseline non-augmented training and weakly-labeled augmentation toward detecting COVID-19 like viral pneumonia in the publicly available COVID-19 CXR collections. This underscores the fact that COVID-19 CXRs have a distinct pattern and hence distribution, unlike non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia and other infectious agents.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sameer K Antani","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nisreen Polus","author_inst":"Medical Analytica Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sabah Jassim","author_inst":"University of Buckingham"},{"author_name":"Vikas OReilly Shah","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chloe Bryson-Cahn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bryan Stevens","author_inst":"Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christina S Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noel S Weiss","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacob Sunshine","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France;

In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz, normal, other_disease, pneumonia and Covid-19. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as 95.3%{+\/-}0.02. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification.
