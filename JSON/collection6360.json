This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution in northern California and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included the need for transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The overall median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; p=0.001). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.7%), hypertension (30.6%) and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia was detected in a total of 28\/85 (32.9%) individual patients, including 22\/28 (78.6%) who required hospital admission. RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including the need for ICU transfer (32.1% vs 14.0%; p=0.05), mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; p=0.01) and 30-day all-cause mortality (14.3% vs 0%; p=0.01). No association was detected between RNAemia and estimated levels of viral RNA in the nasopharynx. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity suggesting the potential utility of plasma viral testing as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine A.

That said, SARS-CoV-2 infects children across all age groups, and despite the high proportion of mild or asymptomatic infections, it would be naive not to consider them as transmitters. To address this point we used cell culture to systematically assess the presence of cultivable SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract in a cohort of our institution first 23 symptomatic neonates, children and teenagers with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR (See Appendix). Median age was 12.0 years (interquartile range [IQR 3.8-14.5], range 7 days-15.9 yrs). Most patients had an upper respiratory tract infection (n=13), followed by fever without source and pneumonia (each, n=2). Samples were collected at a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3) after symptom onset. Median viral load (VL) at time of diagnosis was 3.0x106 copies\/ml (mean 4,4x108, IQR 6.9x103-4.4x108) from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). SARS-CoV-2 virus isolation was successful in 12\/23 (52%) children after inoculating VeroE6 cells with a NPS specimen. SARS-CoV-2 isolation was determined by the presence of a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) and increased viral RNA in the supernatant. SARS-CoV-2 replication in all positive isolates (12\/12) was confirmed by a second passage using new VeroE6 cells. Virus isolation was successful from NPS from all age groups, with a median initial VL of 1.7x108 copies\/ml (mean 7.9x108, IQR 4.7x106-1.0x109) (Figure 1). The youngest patient that SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from was a 7-day old neonate. No correlation between disease presentation and success of virus isolation was observed. Our data show that initial VLs at diagnosis in symptomatic children is comparable to those in adults, and that symptomatic children of all ages shed infectious virus in early acute illness. Infectious virus isolation success was largely comparable to that of adults, although two specimens yielded an isolate at a lower VL (1.2x104 and 1.4x105 copies\/ml) than what was observed in adults. SARS-CoV-2 shedding patterns of culture competent virus in symptomatic children resemble those observed in adults. Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children at this time, biological or other unknown factors could reduce transmission in this population. Both large serological investigations and systematic surveillance of acute respiratory diseases are needed to understand the role of children in this new pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arnaud G L'Huillier","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Giulia Torriani","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Fiona Pigny","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Isabelle Eckerle","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kanagavel Murugesan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jason Kurzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

There are lots of methods for modelling. But we want to determine the best mathematical model and the best time series method among other models. Methods: The data was obtained between January 22 and April 21, 2020 from China records. The number of total cases and the number of total deaths were used for the calculations. For modelling Weibull, Negative Exponential, Von Bertalanffy, Janoscheck, Lundqvist-Korf and Sloboda models were used and AR, MA, ARMA, Holt, Brown and Damped models were used for time series. The determination coefficient (R2), Pseudo R2 and mean square error were used for nonlinear modelling as criteria for determining the model that best describes the number of cases, the number of total deaths and BIC (Bayesian Information Criteria) was used for time series. Results: According to our results, the Sloboda model among the growth curves and ARIMA (0,2,1) model among the times series models were most suitable models for modelling of the number of total cases. In addition Lundqvist-Korf model among the growth curves and Holt linear trend exponential smoothing model among the times series models were most suitable model for modelling of the number of total deaths. Our time series models forecast that the number of total cases will 83311 on 5 May and the number of total deaths will be 5273. Conclusions: Because results of the modelling has providing information on measures to be taken and giving prior information for subsequent similar situations, it is of great importance modeling outbreak indicators for each country separately.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Senol Celik","author_inst":"Department of Biometric and Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, Bingol University,Turkey"},{"author_name":"Handan Ankarali","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ozge Pasin","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Isabelle Eckerle","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kanagavel Murugesan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jason Kurzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries. South Korea, Germany, and Iceland take the bet of massive testing of their population. Whereas tests were not performed widely in southern European countries. As the former undergo a lower case-fatality rate due to the COVID-19 than the latter, the impact of the testing strategy must be investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of testing on the case fatality rate. Methods We use data on inpatients across French geographic areas and propose a novel methodology that exploits policy discontinuities at region borders to estimate the effect of COVID-19 tests on the case-fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined locally. We compare all contiguous department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The heterogeneity in testing rate between department pairs together with the similarities in other dimensions allow us to mimic the existence of treatment and control groups and to identify the impact of testing on mortality. Results The increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.001 percentage point in the death rate. In other words, for each additional 1000 tests, one person would have remained alive. Conclusion Massive population testing could have a significant effect on mortality in different ways. Mass testing may help decision-makers to implement healthcare measures to limit the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony Terriau","author_inst":"GAINS -Le Mans University"},{"author_name":"Julien Albertini","author_inst":"GATES - Lyon 2 University"},{"author_name":"Arthur Poirier","author_inst":"GAINS -Le Mans University"},{"author_name":"Quentin LE BASTARD","author_inst":"Nantes University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Eckerle","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology and Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University "},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kanagavel Murugesan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jason Kurzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

To unravel the clinical heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients, we designed the prospective observational Maastricht Intensive Care COVID cohort; MaastrICCht. We incorporated serial measurements that harbour aetiological, diagnostic and predictive information. The study aims to investigate the heterogeneity of the natural course of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study population: Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the Intensive Care with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main message: We will collect clinical variables, vital parameters, laboratory variables, mechanical ventilator settings, chest electrical impedance tomography, electrocardiograms, echocardiography as well as other imaging modalities to assess heterogeneity of the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill patients. The MaastrICCht cohort is, also designed to foster various other studies and registries and intends to create an open-source database for investigators. Therefore, a major part of the data collection is aligned with an existing national Intensive Care data registry and two international COVID-19 data collection initiatives. Additionally, we create a flexible design, so that additional measures can be added during the ongoing study based on new knowledge obtained from the rapidly growing body of evidence. Conclusion: The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the swift implementation of observational research to unravel heterogeneity of the natural course of the disease of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Our design is expected to enhance aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic understanding of the disease. This paper describes the design of the MaastrICCht cohort.","rel_num_authors":43,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeanette Tas","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Rob J.J. van Gassel","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Serge J.H. heines","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Mark M.G.

However, with the increasing demand for protection, face masks are becoming limited in stock, and the concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many countries are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks. Although various technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment, most of them are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks. In this study, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on face masks, we show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed for a short period of time (1 min) to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator. Scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) tests revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone (five 1-minute exposures). Interestingly, for face masks exposed to ozone gas for 5 min, the amplification of HCoV-229E RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction suggested a loss of infectivity under the effect of ozone, primarily owing to the damage caused to viral envelopes or envelope proteins. Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard-to-reach surfaces, including the fabric structure of face masks. These results suggest that it may be possible to rapidly disinfect contaminated face masks using a plasma generator in a well-ventilated place.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinyeop Lee","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Cheolwoo Bong","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Pan K.

Valproic acid (VPA) has shown anti-inflammatory activity and mild intrinsic antiviral effect. These properties warrant the study of VPA as a possible active treatment in persons with severe COVID-19. Methods: Consecutive adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) will be given intravenous (i.v.) VPA at a starting dose of 20 mg\/kg\/day and up to 60\/kg\/day (in 60 min i.v. infusions in 250 mL normal saline) as needed to reach plasma VPA concentrations of 50-100 mcg\/mL (measured every 72 h). These patients will be followed-up for 10 days for the primary outcome and for a further period of 30 days after treatment completion for the secondary outcome of recurrence. The primary study outcome is the reduction in the case fatality rate of at least 50% after 10 days of treatment (as compared with natural history). Secondary outcomes are the reduction of length of stay (LOS) of at least 50%, as well as COVID-19 recurrence at 30-day follow-up. The most important safety outcomes are acute liver failure, acute pancreatitis, and thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: Although long-term adverse effects and even pro-inflammatory consequences have been reported with the chronic use of VPA, given the urgent need for a drug against COVID-19 to shorten the high mortality and LOS, the study of VPA is justified from a scientific standpoint.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erwin Chiquete","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Liz Toapanta-Yanchapaxi","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cantu-Brito","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Abdurhaman T.

COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, has evolved into a global pandemic with more than 2,900,000 people infected. It has had an acute and dramatic impact on health care systems, economies, and societies of affected countries within these few months. Widespread testing and tracing efforts are employed in many countries in order to contain and mitigate this pandemic. Recent data has indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that the virus can be detected in wastewater. This indicates that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large populations at relevant scales. Collecting raw sewage data, representing specific districts, and crosslinking this data with the number of infected people from each location, will enable us to derive and provide quantitative surveillance tools. In particular, this will provide important means to (i) estimate the extent of outbreaks and their spatial distributions, based primarily on in-sewer measurements (ii) manage the early-warning system quantitatively and efficiently (and similarly, verify disease elimination). Here we report the development of a virus concentration method using PEG or alum, providing an important a tool for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage and relating it to the local populations and geographic information. This will provide a proof of concept for the use of sewage associated virus data as a reliable epidemiological tool.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Itay Bar Or","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Karin Yaniv","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Marilou Shagan","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Eden Ozer","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Oran Erster","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ella Mendelson","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel and School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, "},{"author_name":"Batya Mannasse","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rachel Shirazi","author_inst":"Central virology lab, Ministry of health, Sheba medical center, Israel"},{"author_name":"Esti Kramarsky-Winter","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel."},{"author_name":"Oded Nir","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Hala Abu-Ali","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zeev Ronen","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ehud Rinott","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yair E.

This study is the first in the world about the psychological status of the medical team during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: To study the correlation between risk factors and general symptom index (GSI) score of medical team members who support Wuhan against COVID-19. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Population-based. Participants: Anhui Province sent a total of eight medical teams,including 1382 members,to support Hubei Province. We adopted a stratified sampling method and selected the fourth team sent by Anhui Provincial Hospital, with a total of 137 members as our subjects. Exposures: Four main exposures were collected, including basic information, preparations before going to Wuhan, life issues and working issues after going to Wuhan. Main Outcomes and Measures: The GSI score of SCL-90 scale was used to reflect the frequency and intensity of psychological symptoms. We made the hypothesis of this study before data collection. Results: 110(80.29%) members completed the questionnaire, of which, 77(70.00%) female and 33(30.00%) male. When adjusted age, gender and covariates, DC, LCWT had a positive correlations with GSI score(beta was 10.17, 95%CI was 3.30 to 17.04 for DC, P=0.00<0.05;beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71 for LCWT, P =0.04<0.05;respectively), RBT had a negative positive correlation with GSI score (beta was -28.09, 95%CI was -45.79 to -10.40, P=0.00<0.05), AoBI did not had a correlation with GSI score (beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71, P=0.16>0.05). When adjusted covariates, DC had a positive and RBT had a negative correlation with GSI score of female (beta was 13.20, 95%CI was 4.55 to 21.85, P=0.00<0.05; beta was -57.85, 95%CI was -94.52 to -21.18, P=0.00<0.05; respectively), but for male was not (P=0.59>0.05, P=0.08>0.05, respectively), LCWT and AoBI didn't had correlation with GSI score between genders (P>0.05). Conclusions and Relevance: Improving DC, RBT and decreasing LCWT can reduce the GSI score. AoBI didn't affect the psychological status; male members have a more stable mood than female. Whether other countries medical team has the same result still needs further research.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhang Jinlong","author_inst":"1.Rehabilitation Department, The first affiliated Hospital of university of science and technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)2.

Therefore, early detection of infection is the key to early isolation and treatment. Direct detection of the virus itself has advantages over indirect detection. Currently, the most sensitive and commercially validated method for COVID-19 testing is RT-qPCR, designed to detect amplified virus-specific RNA. Reliable testing has proven to be a bottleneck in early diagnosis of virus infection in all countries dealing with the pandemic. Significant performance and quality issues with available testing kits have caused confusion and serious health risks. In order to provide better understanding of the Quality and performance of COVID-19 RNA detection kits on the market, we designed a system to evaluate the specificity (quantitation), sensitivity (LOD) and robustness of the kits using positive RNA and pseudovirus controls based on COVID-19 genomic sequence. We evaluated 8 Nucleic Acid qPCR Kits approved in China, some of which are also approved in the US and EU. Our study showed that half of these 8 kits lack 1:1 linear relationship for virus RNA copy: qPCR signal. Of the 4 with linear response, 2 demonstrated sensitivity at 1 Copy viral RNA\/Reaction, suitable for early detection of virus infection. Furthermore, we established the best RNA extraction, handling and qPCR procedures allowing highly sensitive and consistent performance using BGI qPCR kits. Our study provides an effective method to assess and compare performance quality of all COVID-19 nucleic acid testing kits, globally.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Surace Kapitula","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Zhuopu Jiang","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Jianhao Jiang","author_inst":"Gene Pharma"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhu","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Xiangyong Chen","author_inst":"Gene Pharma"},{"author_name":"Claudia Qiao Lin","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Chen Xia","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Hong Na","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Jing Xiaolei","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Oded Nir","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Hala Abu-Ali","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Zeev Ronen","author_inst":"Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research (ZIWR), Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boker, 84990, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ehud Rinott","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yair E.

We strongly promote a wide use of validated serologic assays in asymptomatic, healthy individuals, as a crucial information for epidemiological surveillance.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Tosato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michela Pelloso","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of LaboratoryMedicine"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Gallo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chiara Giraudo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Medicine-DIMED, Institute of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Gledis Llanaj","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cosma","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Catia Pozzato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Directional Hospital Management"},{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Markus Mueller","author_inst":"Gemeinschaftspraxis Schwabstrasse 26, Schwabstrasse 26, D-70197 Stuttgart, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katja Roemer","author_inst":"Gemeinschaftspraxis Gotenring, Gotenring 27, D-50679 Koeln, Germany"},{"author_name":"Knud Schewe","author_inst":"ICH Study Center Hamburg, Glockengiesserwall 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Hoffmann","author_inst":"ICH Study Center Hamburg, Glockengiesserwall 1, D-20095 Hamburg; University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3, D-24105 Kiel, "},{"author_name":"Eran Friedler Friedler","author_inst":"Faculty of Civ. and Env.

Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures. Conserving reagents by pooling samples in low-probability settings is proposed, but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity. Methods: We tested an alternate approach (FACT) by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube. This protocol was evaluated by serial incubation of a respiratory swab in up to 10 tubes. The analytics validity of this concept was demonstrated in a five-sample mini pool set-up. It was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients (five-sample pools) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home (ten-sample pools). Results: Serial incubation of a respiratory swab in up to 10 tubes did not lead to a significant decline in viral concentration. The novel FACT-protocol did not cause a false negative result in a five-sample mini-pool setup, with non-significantly differing Ct values between single sample and mini-pool NAT. In two routine applications, all mini pools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified. Conclusions: Our proposed FACT- protocol did not cause a significant loss in analytic or diagnostic sensitivity compared to single sample testing in multiple setups. It reduced the amount of reagents needed by up to 40%, and also reduced hands-on time. This method could enhance testing efficiency, especially in groups with a low pretest-probability, such as systemically relevant professional groups.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Schmidt","author_inst":"German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Frankfurt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Hoehl","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology, University Hospital, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Berger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology, University Hospital, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinz Zeichhardt","author_inst":"Institut fuer Qualitaetssicherung in der Virusdiagnostik - IQVD der GBD mbH, Berlin, Germany;"},{"author_name":"Kai Hourfar","author_inst":"German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Frankfurt, Germany."},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"University Hospital, Goethe University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Erhard Seifried","author_inst":"German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Frankfurt, Germany."},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Directional Hospital Management"},{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Markus Mueller","author_inst":"Gemeinschaftspraxis Schwabstrasse 26, Schwabstrasse 26, D-70197 Stuttgart, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katja Roemer","author_inst":"Gemeinschaftspraxis Gotenring, Gotenring 27, D-50679 Koeln, Germany"},{"author_name":"Knud Schewe","author_inst":"ICH Study Center Hamburg, Glockengiesserwall 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Hoffmann","author_inst":"ICH Study Center Hamburg, Glockengiesserwall 1, D-20095 Hamburg; University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3, D-24105 Kiel, "},{"author_name":"Eran Friedler Friedler","author_inst":"Faculty of Civ. and Env.

There is no known effective therapy for the disease. Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine\/Azithromycin (HY\/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns regarding the potential risk of QT prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). Methods: This is a multicenter retrospective study of 251 patients with COVID-19 treated with HY\/AZ. We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. Results: QTc prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc prolongation to > 500 ms, a known marker of high risk for TdP had developed in 15.9% of patients. One patient developed TdP requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc of patients exhibiting QTc prolongation of > 60 ms was normal. Conclusion: The combination of HY\/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life threating arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY\/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ehud Chorin","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lalit Wadhwani","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Magnani","author_inst":"San Paolo University Hospital, Milan Italy"},{"author_name":"Matthew Dai","author_inst":"NYU Langone Healtha"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ariel Kushmaro","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel and The Ilse Katz Center for M"},{"author_name":"Joachim E Wildberger","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Fabian H Tijssen","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang F.F.A.

The most urgent thing is to find effective treatments. Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine application may be associated with a decreased risk of death in critically ill COVID-19 patients and what is potential mechanism. Design, Setting and Patients: This retrospective study included all 568 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by pathogen laboratory tests despite antiviral treatment and had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, PAO2\/FIO2 <300 with need of mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, between February 1 of 2020 to April 8 of 2020. All 568 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them additionally received oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days). Primary endpoint is mortality of patients, and inflammatory cytokines levels were compared between hydroxychloroquine and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital death and hospital stay time (day) were obtained, level of inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) was measured and compared between HCQ and NHCQ treatments. RESULTS: The median age of 568 critically ill patients is 68 (57, 76) years old with 37.0% being female. Mortalities are 18.8% (9\/48) in HCQ group and 45.8% (238\/520) in NHCQ group (p<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4 - 14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (p<0.05). The level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly lowered from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg\/mL at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg\/ml (p<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with a decreased mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine should be prescribed for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients to save lives.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Yu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Dao Wen Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Chenze Li","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Matthew Dai","author_inst":"NYU Langone Healtha"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ariel Kushmaro","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel and The Ilse Katz Center for M"},{"author_name":"Joachim E Wildberger","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Fabian H Tijssen","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang F.F.A.

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a cluster epidemic with a specific group of overseas returnees and their contacts. The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model to predict the epidemic in Sri Lanka incorporating measures taken for social distancing and prevention of social gatherings. Methods: A hybrid model incorporating both exponential and polynomial features was developed and parameters were estimated. The developed model was validated using the datasets of three reference countries. Finally, the model was applied to the Sri Lankan data to simulate the epidemic behaviour. Additional features were incorporated to the model to examine the effects of current control measures. Findings: Sri Lanka will have a peak of 177 COVID-19 active cases at the end of second incubation period from the index case of our projection, if the same trend continues. At 10% risk, we project a peak of 263 COVID-19 active cases at the end of third incubation period, and a peak of 353 at the end of fourth incubation period. Should the risk level reach 20%, the peak will be above 1000 active cases after 90 days. Simulations incorporating control measures predict that, deviation from the control measures currently in place could trigger exponential behaviour of the epidemic.   Interpretation: The hybrid model combining exponential and polynomial functions showed promising results to predict COVID-19 epidemic. Projections indicate that any early relaxation of control measures is not advisable. This methodological approach can be replicated in other settings at the initial stages of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanjeewa Nishantha Perera","author_inst":"Research & Development Centre for Mathematical Modeling, Department of Mathematics, University of Colombo, Colombo 03, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Naleen C Ganegoda","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Dhammika Deepani Siriwardhana","author_inst":"Department of Disability Studies, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Ragama, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Manuj C Weerasinghe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ariel Kushmaro","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel and The Ilse Katz Center for M"},{"author_name":"Joachim E Wildberger","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Fabian H Tijssen","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang F.F.A.

Method: We performed probability calculations to estimate COVID-19 infection status and likelihood of disease transmission among neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients and health care workers during anti-VEGF procedures, at various community prevalence levels of COVID-19. We then applied the expected burden of COVID-19 illness and death expressed through health-adjusted life-years (HALYs) lost. We compared these results to the expected disease burden of severe visual impairment if sight protecting anti-VEGF injections were not performed. Results: Our calculations estimate for a single treatment, where the background rate of COVID-19 in the community is 1000 active cases per million population, and full personal protective equipment (PPE) is available, that the benefits of treatment are greater than the expected harms to the patient and immediate health care team, provided the probability of severe visual impairment without treatment is >0.001%. Without effective PPE, and with a COVID-19 prevalence of 200,000 per million, an 8.5% chance of severe visual impairment could still justify monthly injections for six months. Conclusion: In most cases analysed, the reduced disease burden from avoiding visual impairment outweighs the expected HALYs lost from COVID-19 transmission. This finding is driven by the fact that HALYs lost when someone suffers severe visual impairment for 5 years are equivalent to nearly 400 moderate cases of infectious disease lasting 2 weeks each.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt James Boyd","author_inst":"Adapt Research Ltd, Reefton, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Daniel Andrew Richard Scott","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Gisborne Hospital, Hauora Tairawhiti, Gisborne, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"David Michael Squirrell","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Greenlane Clinical Centre, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Graham Ashley Wilson","author_inst":"Matai Lab, Gisborne, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ariel Kushmaro","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel and The Ilse Katz Center for M"},{"author_name":"Joachim E Wildberger","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Fabian H Tijssen","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang F.F.A.

The patients were admitted between 10 January and 10 April 2020; with the first COVID-19 positive diagnosis on 6 March. A surge in admissions started around the 15 March and peaked at the beginning of April. 56.8% of the admissions were male and 43.2% were female. The average age of the 500 admissions was 69.32 years (SD 19.23 years, range 1 week to 99.21 years). By the morning of 14 April 2020, 199 patients had been discharged (Female 89, Male 111), 163 patients had died (female 61, male 102) and 131 remained as in-patients (female 66, male 71). Fewer than one in twenty deaths occurred in patients below the age of 50 years, in either gender. Mortality rose dramatically, for both genders, after the age of sixty with males being almost twice as vulnerable to dying, as females, during the 7th decade. Males older than their mid-fifties were more likely to die than leave hospital. The same applied to females beyond their mid seventies. We did not see any evidence of a poorer outcome associated with a lower decile for Index of Multiple Deprivation or convincing evidence that any Ethnic minority groups were more likely to die than the White subgroups. When compared to the equivalent medical conditions, normally treated in the early spring, COVID-19 has an increased mortality, adversely affecting more men and an older population. The mean duration from admission to discharge was 11.29 days (SD 11.50 days). For admission to death, the mean interval was 11.72 days (SD 11.05 days). 62 of the 500 admissions required ventilator support. Of this subgroup, 71% were male and 29% were female. By the morning of the 14 April, no female over the age of 60 had left the intensive care unit alive and no male over the age of 50 had left the intensive care unit alive. At this time-point, 1.2% of the 500 admitted patients had returned alive from the intensive care units, following a period of ventilator support. This figure will rise if prolonged ventilator and renal support proves effective. While only providing a snapshot of a relatively small number of patients, reviewed over a short time period, from a small geographic area, the data supports the view that the younger members of society are less vulnerable to the adverse sequelae of COVID-19 infection and that any return to normal work and social activities should be considered initially for the individuals who are less than 40-50 years of age. There is an ongoing need for analyses on larger patient cohorts using both demographic and detailed clinical data.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard E Field","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Irrum Afzal","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"John Dixon","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vipul R Patel","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Putul Sarkar","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James E Marsh","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ariel Kushmaro","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel and The Ilse Katz Center for M"},{"author_name":"Joachim E Wildberger","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Fabian H Tijssen","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang F.F.A.

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in COVID-19 patients with death or survival. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19 using a fixed or random-effects model. Results: In the meta-analysis of 18 studies, which included a total of 2,862 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 30.9 IU\/L in the COVID-19 patients with death and 26.3 IU\/L in the COVID-19 patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). The pooled mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 45.3 IU\/L in the COVID-19 patients with death while 30.1 IU\/L in the patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). Compared with the discharged alive cases, the dead cases tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time, and international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction. Patients died from COVID-19 tend to have different liver chemistries from those are discharged alive. Close monitoring of liver chemistries provides an early warning against COVID-19 related death.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qing-Qing Xing","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Dong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Dan Ren","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wei-Ming Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Dan-Yi Zeng","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Yan Cai","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Zhu Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shui Pan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ariel Kushmaro","author_inst":"Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren, Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel and The Ilse Katz Center for M"},{"author_name":"Joachim E Wildberger","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Fabian H Tijssen","author_inst":"MUMC"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang F.F.A.

We performed a monocentric cross-sectional study describing the clinical course of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients from northern Italy treated with calcineurin-inhibitors for organ transplantation or rheumatic diseases. Data were collected by phone call and clinical chart review between March 27th- 31st 2020. COVID-19 related symptoms, rynopharingeal swab, therapeutic changes and outcome were assessed in 384 consecutive patients (57% males; median age 61 years, IQR 48-69). 331 patients (86%) received solid organ transplantation (kidney n=140, 36%, heart n=100, 26%, lung n=91, 24%) and 53 (14%) had a rheumatic disease. Calcineurin inhibitors were the only immunosuppressant administered in 46 patients (12%). 14 patients developed a confirmed COVID-19 (swab positivity) and 14 a clinical COVID-19 (only typical symptoms). Fever (75%) and diarrhoea (50%) were the most common symptoms. Fourteen patients were hospitalized and 11 have already been dismissed. No patient required start\/changes of the O2 therapy or developed superinfection. Only one patient, with metastatic lung cancer, died. In conclusion, COVID-19 showed a mild course in our cohort, with low mortality. Calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimens appear safe in this context and should not be discontinued.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cavagna","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Bruno","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Zanframundo","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marilena Gregorini","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elena Seminari","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angela Di Matteo","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Teresa Rampino","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlomaurizio Montecucco","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Pelenghi","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Cattadori","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Francesca Pattoneri","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vitulo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Mediterraneo Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT), Palermo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bertani","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Mediterraneo Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT), Palermo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Sambataro","author_inst":"A.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as an important functional receptor for SARS-Cov-2. ACE2 and ACE are homologues with inverse functions in the renin-angiotensin system. ACE converts angiotensin I into a vital vasoactive peptide called angiotensin II(AngII), whereas ACE2 hydrolyzes AngII into a series of vasodilators. There were few reports illustrated the expression of AngII in COVID-19. This study aimed to demonstrate the expression of angiotensin II in COVID-19 and how it correlated to the disease. Methods: We enrolled 55 patients with COVID-19 admitted to renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 21st to February 21st, 2020. Demographic data were collected upon admission. COVID-19 nuclear acid, plasma AngII, Renin and aldosterone in the lying position without sodium restriction, and other laboratory indicators were together measured by the laboratory department of our hospital. Findings: Of the 55 patients with COVID-19, 34(61.8%) had an increased level of AngII. The severity of COVID-19 and male is positively related with the level of AngII. The level of blood lymphocyte, PCT, ALT, and AST were remarkably severe with those of normal level of AngII (P < 0.05). CD4\/CD8 cells ratio was significantly higher whereas CD3+CD8+ cells amount, CD3+CD8+ cells proportion, CD56+CD16+CD3- cells amount and CD19+CD3- cells amount were considerably lower than those of normal level of AngII (P < 0.05). Abnormal rates of blood lymphocyte and PCT were significantly higher in Patients with elevated AngII level. The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 (OR=4.123) and CD4\/CD8 ratio(OR=4.050) were the co-directional impact factor while female(OR=0.146) was inverse impact factor of elevated AngII level. Interpretation: High rate of increased level of AngII was detected in COVID-19 patients. Patients with elevated AngII level were more likely to be critically ill with COVID-19. Considering the gender differences in ACE2 expression and no gender differences in angiotensin expression, the gender differences in AngII level might indicate less loss of ACE2 in female patients. Elevated AngII level was correlated with CD4\/CD8 ratio, suggesting it might involve in immune disorder.

Our aim is to predict the impact of the compulsory containment on COVID-19 spread. Earlier knowledge of the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 transmission related to Morocco will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control the epidemic. Method: Using a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious model and the data of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd to April 9, 2020, we determined the basic and control reproduction numbers and we estimated the model parameter values. Furthermore, simulations of different scenarios of containment are performed. Results: Epidemic characteristics are predicted according to different rates of containment. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI(2.6729-3.1485). Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, is determined. Conclusion: Our findings show that the basic reproduction number reflects a high speed of spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. However, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July 4th which can be harmful and lead to consequent social-economic damages. Thus, containment need to be accompanied by other measures such as mass testing to reduce the size of asymptomatic population. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis investigation shows that the COVID-19 dynamics depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our results can help the Moroccan government to anticipate the spread of COVID-19 and avoid human loses and consequent social-economic damages as well.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aayah Hammoumi","author_inst":"Cadi Ayyad University"},{"author_name":"Redouane Qesmi","author_inst":"USMBA University"},{"author_name":"Ren-Gui Chen","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Heng-Mei Zhu","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Elena Seminari","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angela Di Matteo","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Teresa Rampino","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlomaurizio Montecucco","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Pelenghi","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Cattadori","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Francesca Pattoneri","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vitulo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Mediterraneo Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT), Palermo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bertani","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Mediterraneo Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT), Palermo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Sambataro","author_inst":"A.

Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyse the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included questions regarding fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and ageusia. A total of 2,071,349 survey responses were analysed. We defined a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Average (SA), as the mean number of symptoms reported by responders. Data were collected between March 15th to June 3rd, 2020. Notably, on the population level, following severe lockdown measures between March 15th and April 20th, SA sharply declined by 83.8% (p < 0.05), as did every single symptom, including the most common symptoms reported by our responders, cough and rhinorrhea and\\or nasal congestion, which decreased by 74.1% (p < 0.05) and 69.6% (p < 0.05), respectively. Similarly, on the individual level, analysis of repeated responses from the same individuals (N = 208,637) over time also showed a decrease in symptoms during this time period. Moreover, the reduction in symptoms was observed in all cities in Israel, and in several stratifications of demographic characteristics. Different symptoms exhibit different reduction dynamics, suggesting differences in the nature of the symptoms or in the underlying medical conditions. Between May 13th and June 3rd, following several subsequent lockdown relief measures, we observed an increase in individual symptoms and in SA, which increased by 31.42%. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel, and an increase in the prevalence of symptoms following the loosening of lockdown restrictions. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This quantification may be of major interest for COVID-19 pandemic, as many countries consider implementation of lockdown strategies.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amir Gavrieli","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Hagai Rossman","author_inst":"Weizmann institute of science"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tomer Meir","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tal Karady","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amit Lavon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Kolobkov","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Saar Shoer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marcus L.F.

Here we used a SEIR model that properly accounts for the distribution of the latent period and, based on empirical estimates of the doubling time in the near-exponential phases of epidemic progression in several locations, we estimated that R0 lies in the range 4.7-11.4. We explained this discrepancy by performing stochastic simulations of model dynamics in a population with a small proportion of super-spreaders. The simulations revealed two-phase dynamics, in which an initial phase of relatively slow epidemic progression diverts to a faster phase upon appearance of infectious super-spreaders. Early estimates obtained for this initial phase may suggest lower R0.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marek Kochanczyk","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research"},{"author_name":"Frederic Grabowski","author_inst":"Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Lipniacki","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tomer Meir","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tal Karady","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amit Lavon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Kolobkov","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Saar Shoer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marcus L.F.

Objectives: To synthesise existing evidence about communication practices used to discuss difficult matters, including prognosis and end of life, and to use this evidence to make recommendations for clinical practice. The aim of this study was to use rapid review methods to update findings from a previous systematic review published in 2014. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA and Amed. Study eligibility criteria: Studies using conversation analysis or discourse analysis to examine recordings of actual conversations about difficult matters relating to future illness progression and end of life. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Data appraisal and extraction procedures used in the 2014 review were modified for this rapid review. Results: Following screening, 18 sources were deemed to meet eligibility criteria, which were added to the 19 sources included in the 2014 systematic review. Synthesis of study findings identified 11 communication practices: providing opportunities for patient or family members to propose matters to discuss (7 out of 37 included sources); seeking a patient or family member's perspective (6\/37); discussing the future indirectly (11\/37); discussing the future explicitly (7\/37) linking to something previously said or done (11\/37); using hypothetical scenarios (13\/37); framing a difficult matter as universal (5\/37); acknowledging uncertainty (3\/37); exploring options (2\/37); displaying sensitivity (7\/37); emphasising the positive (7\/37). Limitations: Dividing work amongst the study authors to enable rapid review may have created inconsistencies. Conclusions and implications of key findings: This synthesis of high-quality evidence from actual clinical practice supports a series of recommendations for communicating about difficult matters during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stuart Ekberg","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ruth Parry","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Land","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Katie Ekberg","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marco Pino","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Charles Antaki","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Amit Lavon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Kolobkov","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Saar Shoer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marcus L.F.
