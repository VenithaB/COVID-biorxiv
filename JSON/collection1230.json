Design: National, cross-sectional study. Setting: Mexico. Participants: 416546 adult patients; 4178 Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 were the primary population under study. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was mortality from COVID-19 up to August 3rd, 2020. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. Results: Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5% vs 11.1%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7% vs 1.7%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). Conclusions: In the large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. More research is needed regarding the impact of the COVID-19 among racial and ethnic minorities in Mexico.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ismael Ibarra-Nava","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon"},{"author_name":"Kathia G.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data collected from the Catalan Health Surveillance System (CatSalut) in Catalonia, a region of Spain. PARTICIPANTS Using data collected between 1 March and 1 June 2020, we conducted the following comparative analyses: people infected by SARS-CoV-2 (328 892) vs Catalonia's entire population (7 699 568); COVID-19 cases who required hospitalisation (37 638) vs cases who did not require hospitalisation (291 254); and COVID-19 cases who died during the study period vs cases who did not die during the study period (12 287). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Three clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 (infection, hospitalisation, or death). We analysed sociodemographic and environment variables (such as residing in a nursing home) and the presence of previous comorbidities. RESULTS A total of 328 892 cases were considered to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.27% of total population). The main risk factors for the diagnostic were: female gender (risk ratio [RR] =1.49; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] =1.48-1.50), age (45-64 years old; RR=1.02; 95% CI=1.01-1.03), high comorbidity burden (GMA index) (RR=3.03; 95% CI=2.97-3.09), reside in a nursing home (RR=11.82; 95% CI=11.66-11.99), and smoking (RR=1.06; 95% CI=1.05-1.07). During the study period, there were 37 638 (11.4 %) hospitalisations due to COVID-19, and the risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.45; 95% CI=1.43-1.48), age > 65 (RR=2.38; 95% CI=2.28-2.48), very low individual income (RR=1.03; 95% CI=0.97-1.08), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.15; 95% CI=4.89-5.42). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were obesity (RR=1.23; 95% CI=1.20-1.25), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR=1.19; 95% CI=1.15-1.22), heart failure (RR=1.19; 95% CI=1.16-1.22), diabetes mellitus (RR=1.07; 95% CI=1.04-1.10), and neuro-psychiatric comorbidities (RR=1.06; 95% CI=1.03-1.10). A total of 12 287 deaths (3.73%) were attributed to COVID-19, and the main risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.73; 95% CI=1.67-1.81), age > 65 (RR=37.45; 95% CI=29.23-47.93), residing in a nursing home (RR=9.22; 95% CI=8.81-9.65), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.25; 95% CI=4.60-6.00). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were: heart failure (RR=1.21; 95% CI=1.16-1.22), chronic kidney disease (RR=1.17; 95% CI=1.13-1.22), and diabetes mellitus (RR=1.10; 95% CI=1.06-1.14). These results did not change significantly when we considered only PCR-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS Female gender, age between 45 to 64 years old, high burden of comorbidities, and factors related to environment (nursing home) play a relevant role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. In addition, we found risk factors for hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 that had not been described to date, including comorbidity burden, neuro-psychiatric disorders, and very low individual income. This study supports interventions for transmission control beyond stratify-and-shield strategies focused only on protecting those at risk of death. Future COVID-19 studies should examine the role of gender, the burden of comorbidities, and socioeconomic status in disease transmission, and should determine its relationship to workplaces, especially healthcare centres and nursing homes.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Judit Villar-Garcia","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rosa Maria Vivanco-Hidalgo","author_inst":"Agencia de Qualitat i Avaluacio Sanitaries de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Cleries","author_inst":"Area de sistemes de informacio, Servei Catala de la Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elisenda Martinez","author_inst":"Agencia de Qualitat i Avaluacio Sanitaries de Catalunya Barcelona,Spain"},{"author_name":"David Monterde","author_inst":"Sistemes de Informacio, Institut Catala de la Salut Barcelona,Spain"},{"author_name":"Pol Perez-Sust","author_inst":"Area de Sistemes de Informacio.

An accurate prognostic assessment is necessary to improve survival of patients, especially in developing countries. This study proposes to predict the risk of developing critical conditions in COVID-19 patients by training multipurpose algorithms. Methods A total of 1,040 patients with a positive RT-PCR diagnosis for COVID-19 from a large hospital from Sao Paulo, Brazil, were followed from March to June 2020, of which 288 (28%) presented a severe prognosis, i.e. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death. Routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data was used to train five machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, extra trees, random forests, catboost, and extreme gradient boosting). A random sample of 70% of patients was used to train the algorithms and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating new unseen data. In order to assess if the algorithms could capture general severe prognostic patterns, each model was trained by combining two out of three outcomes to predict the other. Results All algorithms presented very high predictive performance (average AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.82). The three most important variables for the multipurpose algorithms were ratio of lymphocyte per C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein and Braden Scale. Conclusion The results highlight the possibility that machine learning algorithms are able to predict unspecific negative COVID-19 outcomes from routinely-collected data.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernando Timoteo Fernandes","author_inst":"Fundacentro"},{"author_name":"Tiago Almeida de Oliveira","author_inst":"Paraiba State University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Esteves Teixeira","author_inst":"National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Andre Filipe de Moraes Batista","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Dalla Costa","author_inst":"BP - A Beneficencia Portuguesa de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Chiavegatto Filho","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luis Garcia-Eroles","author_inst":"Area de Sistemes de Informacio.

It is proposed that it could be used to display direct retrieval and the functional sequelae of COVID-19. Aim of the study: To assess the Post COVID-19 functional status in Egypt and to evaluate if age, gender, comorbidities have any effect on functional limitations in recovered COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods: A total of 444 registered confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. They were interviewed in our follow-up clinics or by calls and filled an Arabic translated PCFS scale in paper or online forms as well as their demographic and clinical data. Results: 80% of COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible (63.1%), slight (14.4%), moderate (2%) to severe (0.5%) based on PCFS. Furthermore, there was a substantial variance between the score of PCFS with age (P= 0.003), gender (P= 0.014), the duration since the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 (P <0.001), need for oxygen supplementation (P<0.001), need for ICU admittance (P= 0.003), previous periodic influenza vaccination (P<0.001), smoking status (P < 0.001) and lastly the presence of any comorbid disorder (P <0.001). Conclusions: Most of the COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible to severe based on PCFS. These restrictions were affected by age, gender, periodic influenza vaccination, smoking, duration since symptoms onset, need for oxygen or ICU admittance, and lastly the presence of coexisting comorbidity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliae Mohamed-Hussein","author_inst":"Faculty of medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Islam Galal","author_inst":"Chest Department, Aswan University"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Saad","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Hossam Eldeen Zayan","author_inst":"Assiut University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Moustafa Abdelsayed","author_inst":"Assiut University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Moustafa","author_inst":"Chest Department, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Abdel Rahman Ezzat","author_inst":"Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Radwa Helmy","author_inst":"Assiut Unicersity"},{"author_name":"Howaida Abd Elaal","author_inst":"Faculty of Nursing, Aswan University"},{"author_name":"Karim Aly","author_inst":"Cardiology, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Shaimaa Abderheem","author_inst":"Public Health, Aswan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20181644","rel_title":"County-level exposures to greenness and associations with COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the United States","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20181644","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has killed more than 175,000 people in the US. During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. Objectives: We evaluated whether greenness is related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the United States. Methods: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home order. Results: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and high median home values, and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with high percentages of Black residents, high median home value, and higher population density. Discussion: Exposures to NDVI had beneficial impacts on county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US and may have reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates, especially in densely populated counties.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jochem O Klompmaker","author_inst":"Harvard T.

This previously described algorithm uses data-driven gene list weightings to produce a comprehensive ranked list of implicated host genes. From 32 datasets, the top ranked gene was PPIA, encoding cyclophilin A, a drug- gable target using cyclosporine.Other highly-ranked genes included proposed prognostic factors (CXCL10, CD4, CD3E) and investigational therapeutic tar- gets (IL1A) for COVID-19. Gene rankings also inform the interpretation of COVID-19 GWAS results, implicating FYCO1 over other nearby genes in a disease-associated locus on chromosome 3.

Using comprehensive death records covering around 300 million Chinese people, we estimate the impacts of city and community lockdowns on non-COVID-19 mortality outside of Wuhan. Employing a difference-in-differences method, we find that lockdowns reduced the number of non-COVID-19 deaths by 4.9% (cardiovascular deaths by 6.2%, injuries by 9.2%, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia deaths by 14.3%). The health benefits are likely driven by significant reductions in air pollution, traffic, and human interactions. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that more than 32,000 lives could have been saved from non-COVID-19 diseases\/causes during the 40 days of the lockdown on which we focus. The results suggest that the rapid and strict virus countermeasures not only effectively controlled the spread of COVID-19 but also brought about massive unintended public health benefits.

Methods: Twenty-seven (27) states in the United States were selected on June 17, 2020 from IHME data which had clearly defined and dated establishment of statewide mandates for social distancing measures to include: School closures, Prohibition on mass gatherings, business closures, stay at home orders, severe travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The state Covid-19 mortality prevalence was defined as total normalized deaths to the peak daily mortality rate. The state mortality prevalence was correlated to the total number of mandates-days from their date of establishment to the peak daily mortality date. The slope of the maximum daily mortality rate was also correlated to mandate-days. Results: The standardized mortality per state to the initial peak mortality rate did not demonstrate a discernable correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.000006, p= 0.995). The standardized peak mortality rate per state suggested a slight correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.053,p=0.246), but was not statistically significant. There was a significant correlation between standardized mortality and state population density (R2 = 0.524,p=0.00002). Conclusions: The analysis appears to suggest no mandate effective reduction in Covid-19 mortality nor a reduction in Covid-19 mortality rate to its defined initial peak when interpreting the mean-effect of the mandates as present in the data. A strong correlation to population density suggests human interaction frequency does affect the total mortality and maximum mortality rate.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean McCafferty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sean Ashley","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Peng Yin","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Jianmei Liu","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Pan","author_inst":"Division of Environment and Sustainability, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Tanakao Takana","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Peiyu Xie","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoguang Wang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuocen Liu","author_inst":"Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University, University Town, Nanshan District, 518055 Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 155 Changbai Road, Changping District, 102206 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Guojun He","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Division of Environment and Sustainability, and Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water"},{"author_name":"Maigeng Zhou","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182386","rel_title":"Towards a digital solution: Predicting public take-up of Singapore's contact tracing application during the COVID-19 crisis","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182386","rel_abs":"In the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), new digital solutions have been developed for infection control.

Participants were 505 adults who completed a web-based survey in Singapore, the site of the first contact tracing application (TraceTogether). We found that persons who had already changed their lifestyles on account of the pandemic were more likely to download the application. Network analyses revealed that contact tracing downloads was associated with using hand sanitizers, avoiding public transport, and preferring outdoor over indoor venues during the pandemic. However, demographic and situational characteristics were not significant predictors of application downloads.

Early evidence points to significant endothelial dysfunction, micro-thromboses, pro-inflammation as well as a dysregulated immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this study, we analyzed the cargo of EVs isolated from the plasma of patients with COVID-19 for the identification of potential biomarkers of disease severity and to explore their role in disease pathogenesis. Plasma-derived EVs were isolated from 53 hospitalized patients with COVID infection and compared according to the severity of the disease. Analysis of inflammatory and cardiovascular protein cargo of large EVs revealed significantly differentially expressed proteins for each disease sub-group. Notably, members of the TNF superfamily and IL-6 family were up-regulated in patients on oxygen support with severe and moderate disease. EVs from the severe group were also enhanced with pro-thrombotic\/endothelial injury factors (TF, t-PA, vWF) and proteins associated with cardiovascular pathology (MB, PRSS8, REN, HGF). Significantly higher levels of TF, CD163, and EN-RAGE were observed in EVs from severe patients when compared to patients with a moderate disease requiring supplemental O2. Importantly, we also observed increased caspase 3\/7 activity and decreased cell survival in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells exposed to EVs from the plasma of patients with severe disease compared to healthy controls. In conclusion, our findings indicate alterations in pro-inflammatory, coagulopathy, and endothelial injury protein cargo in large EVs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may be a causative agent in severe illness.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Balaji Krishnamachary","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christine Cook","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Leslie Spikes","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Prabhakar Chalise","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Navneet K Dhillon","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Pan","author_inst":"Division of Environment and Sustainability, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Tanakao Takana","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Peiyu Xie","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoguang Wang","author_inst":"National School of Development, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Haidian District, 100871 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuocen Liu","author_inst":"Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University, University Town, Nanshan District, 518055 Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 155 Changbai Road, Changping District, 102206 Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Guojun He","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Division of Environment and Sustainability, and Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water"},{"author_name":"Maigeng Zhou","author_inst":"National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 Nanwei Road, Xicheng Distr"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20182550","rel_title":"MAIT cell activation and dynamics associated with COVID-19 disease severity and outcome","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20182550","rel_abs":"Severe COVID-19 is characterized by excessive inflammation of the lower airways.

Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation, as well as significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69high and CXCR3low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and subsequent release with disease resolution. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiphaine Parrot","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jean-Baptiste Gorin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ponzetta","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kimia T Maleki","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kammann","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johanna Emgard","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andre Perez Potti","author_inst":"Karrolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Takuya Sekine","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olga Rivera-Ballesteros","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

Reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR assay of throat swab samples vary from 30%-60%. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient. In this study, we aimed to analyze OSN-qRT-PCR by comparing it with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qRT-PCR by using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and a quality assessment panel. The clinical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR was also validated and compared with ddPCR and qRT-PCR using specimens from COVID-19 patients. The LoD (copies\/ml) of qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and OSN-qRT-PCR were 520.1 (95% CI): 363.23-1145.69) for ORF1ab and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7-1248.7) for N, 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8-938.3) for ORF1ab and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6-792.5) for N, and 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7-430.9) for ORF1ab and 189.1 (95% CI: 130.9-433.9) for N, respectively. Of the 34 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, the positive rates of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR were 82.35% (28\/34), 67.65% (23\/34), and 58.82% (20\/34), respectively. In conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific OSN-qRT-PCR assay is superior to ddPCR and qRT-PCR assays, showing great potential as a technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral loads.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Dai","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Huiyan Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tuantuan Li","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yan Fang","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zuojun Shen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Lichang Chen","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital, Fuyang Infectious Disease Clinical College, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowu Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Xuejun Ma","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and prevention"},{"author_name":"Ming Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

Overall, among 27 (61%) pregnant women and 17 (39%) post-partum women, 6 (14%) patients received oxygen supplementation and 2 (4%) required admission to intensive care unit but none died. During hospitalization neutrophils (p=0.002), neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (p=0.037) and C reactive protein (p<0.001) decreased significantly, whereas lymphocytes (p<0.001) and platelets (p<0.001) increased. Leukocytes and lymphocytes values at admission were correlated with oxygen need, with respectively a 1% and 5% higher risk of oxygen supplementation for each 1,000 cells decrease. Overall, in obstetric patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019, C reactive protein is the inflammatory biomarker that better mirrors the course of the disease whereas D-dimer or ferritin are not reliable predictors of poor outcome.

In this study, we clarified the publication trends of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) regarding COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study by investigating the number of SRs and RCTs on topics related to COVID-19 practice published in PubMed and medRxiv between January 1 and June 30, 2020. We calculated the ratio of the number of RCTs to that of SRs for this study period, as in a previous study. Results: The SR\/RCT ratio in PubMed increased from 9.0 in March to 102 in June. In medRxiv, the SR\/RCT ratio rose from 7.7 in March to 16.5 in June Discussion: The SR\/RCT ratio increased and was much higher than that of 0.871 in 2017 found in a previous review of all medical research.

Objectives: This review aimed to identify which clinical dental procedures do generate droplets and aerosols with subsequent contamination, and for these, characterise their pattern, spread and settle. Materials and Method: Six databases were searched and citation chasing undertaken (to 11\/08\/20). Screening stages were undertaken in duplicate, independently, by two researchers. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Results: Eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: Ultrasonic scaling (USS, n=44), high speed air-rotor (HSAR, n=31); oral surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece (n=4); air-water (triple) syringe (n=4), air-polishing (n=4), prophylaxis (n=2) and hand-scaling (n=2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced the greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operator torso operator arm, and patient body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded significant inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher risk (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe [air only or air\/water together], air polishing, extractions using motorised hand-pieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis with pumice, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling. Conclusion: Significant gaps in the evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit firm conclusions around contamination for different procedures. However, a hierarchy of contamination from procedures can be proposed for challenge\/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis. Clinical significance (49 words): This manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather than the current binary AGP or non-AGP perspective. This informs discussion around AGPs and direct future research to help support knowledge and decision making around COVID-19 and dental procedures.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Innes","author_inst":"University of Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Ilona Johnson","author_inst":"University of Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Waraf Al-Yaseen","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Harris","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Rhiannon Jones","author_inst":"University of Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Sukriti KC","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Scott McGregor","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mark Robertson","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Wade","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in the Palestinian population residing in the West Bank. Blood samples were collected between 15th June 2020 and 30th June 2020 from 1355 individuals from randomly selected households in the West Bank in addition to 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories between the 1st May 2020 and 9th July 2020 for a routine checkup. Out of the 2491 blood samples collected, serological tests for 2455 adequate serum samples were done using an Immunoassay for qualitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 .The random sample of Palestinians living in the West Bank yielded 0% seroprevalence with 95% CI [0,0.0036], while the lab referrals sample yielded an estimated seroprevalence of 0.354% with 95% CI [0.0011,0096]. Our results indicate that as of July 2020, seroprevalence in Palestine persist low and is inadequate to provide herd immunity, emphasizing the need to maintain health measures to keep the outbreak under control. Population-based seroprevalence studies are to be conducted periodically to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Palestine and inform policy makers about the efficacy of their surveillance system.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nouar Qutob","author_inst":"arab american university"},{"author_name":"Faisal Awartani","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Zaidoun Salah","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Asia","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Imad Abu Khader","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Herzallah","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Nadeen Balqis","author_inst":"Nadeen.Balqis@aaup.edu"},{"author_name":"Husam Sallam","author_inst":"Husam.Sallam@aaup.edu"},{"author_name":"William Wade","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Soo Aleman","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Buggert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Johan K.

Design: After geographically-spaced community sampling of households, one individual per household was tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein in a two-week interval. Setting: Slum and non-slum communities in three wards, one each from the three main zones of Mumbai. Participants: Individuals over age 12 who consent to and have no contraindications to venipuncture were eligible. 6,904 participants (4,202 from slums and 2,702 from non-slums) were tested. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were the positive test rate for IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein by demographic group (age and gender) and location (slums and non-slums). The secondary outcome is seroprevalence at slum and non-slum levels. Sera was tested via chemiluminescence (CLIA) using Abbott Diagnostics ArchitectTM N-protein based test. Seroprevalence was calculated using weights to match the population distribution by age and gender and accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the test. Results: The positive test rate was 54.1% (95% CI: 52.7 to 55.6) and 16.1% (95% CI: 14.9 to 17.4) in slums and non-slums, respectively, a difference of 38 percentage points (P < 0.001). Accounting for imperfect accuracy of tests (e.g., sensitivity, 0.90; specificity 1.00), seroprevalence was as high as 58.4% (95% CI: 56.8 to 59.9) and 17.3% (95% CI: 16 to 18.7) in slums and non-slums, respectively. Conclusions: The high seroprevalence in slums implies a moderate infection fatality rate. The stark difference in seroprevalence across slums and non-slums has implications for the efficacy of social distancing, the level of herd immunity, and equity. It underlines the importance of geographic specificity and urban structure in modeling SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anup Malani","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Daksha Shah","author_inst":"Brahinmumbai Municipal Corporation"},{"author_name":"Gagandeep Kang","author_inst":"Vellore Christian Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gayatri Nair Lobo","author_inst":"A.T.E.

We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a simple model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant variable which is specific to each area. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the `current' level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. Finally, we see that small deviations from the optimal solution can lead to dramatic violations of the constraints.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Afroza Shirin","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Yen Ting Lin","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Francesco Sorrentino","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Gayatri Nair Lobo","author_inst":"A.T.E.

Agents decide whether to \"go out\" (or self-quarantine) and, if so, whether to wear protection such as masks. Three elements distinguish the model from existing work. First, non-symptomatic agents do not know if they are infected. Second, some of these agents unknowingly transmit infections. Third, we permit two-sided prevention via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions: the probability of a person catching the virus from another depends on protection choices made by each. We find that a mean-preserving increase in pre-existing income inequality unambiguously increases the equilibrium proportion of unprotected, socializing agents and may increase or decrease the proportion who self-quarantine. Strikingly, while higher pre-COVID inequality may or may not raise the overall risk of infection, it increases the risk of disease in social interactions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joydeep Bhattacharya","author_inst":"iowa state university"},{"author_name":"Shankha Chakraborty","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Xiumei Yu","author_inst":"Zhongnan University of Economics and Law"},{"author_name":"Gayatri Nair Lobo","author_inst":"A.T.E.

Well-established measures, such as social distancing, testing, contact tracing, improved hygiene, and generalized use of personal protective equipment, are almost impossible to implement. We specifically investigated the impact of adapting these measures to informal settlements located in regions immersed in protracted conflicts, taking the Northwest region of Syria (NWS) as a case study. Such regions need to contend with the public health challenges resulting from violence, deterioration of health-systems, and political instability. We implemented a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model to simulate the spread of the virus in high-density camps of Internally Displaced Persons, using a population structure representative of these camps. We chose parameters corresponding to a worst-case scenario where there is no healthcare available. We expanded on previous models to adapt feasible interventions to the living conditions in the camps, including moderate self-distancing, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, and protection of the most vulnerable in \"safety zones\". All the interventions significantly reduce the probability of observing an outbreak and the death toll. Self-distancing brings the best results if contacts are reduced by 50%, with mortality reduced by up to 35%. A similar reduction in mortality can be achieved by providing 1 self-isolation tent per 200 individuals. Protecting the vulnerable in a safety zone has synergistic effects with previous interventions for the whole population, but is especially beneficial for the vulnerable population. Complementary measures, such as lockdown of the safety zone when a first case is detected in the camp, further reduce mortality and the probability of an outbreak. Our model predicts that a combination of all simulated interventions may reduce mortality by as much as 80%. The time until the number of symptomatic cases peaks is delayed by most of the interventions, in some cases by more than three months. The proportion of the population that recovers, near 70%, could help prevent future outbreaks. Our results highlight the potential of non-medical interventions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. They demonstrate that interventions shown to be effective in other settings can be adapted to refugee camps and are most effective when implemented in tandem. Our modelization considers complementary measures to these interventions that can be implemented autonomously by these communities, such as buffer zones, daily health-checks, and carers for isolated individuals, quantifying their impact on the micro-dynamics of disease transmission.

In Belgium, by the end of August, 93% of deaths due to COVID-19 were aged 65 or older. Similar trends were observed in other countries. As a consequence, older adults were identified as a group at risk, and strict governmental restrictions were imposed on them. This has caused concerns about their mental health. Using an online survey, this study established the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults aged 65 years or older, and which factors moderate this impact. Participants reported a significant decrease in activity level, sleep quality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was strongly related to reported declines in activity level, sleep quality, wellbeing and cognitive functioning. Our study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the mental health of older adults. This implies that this group at risk requires attention of governments and healthcare.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah De Pue","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Celine Gillebert","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Eva Dierckx","author_inst":"Vrije Universiteit Brussel"},{"author_name":"Marie-Anne Vanderhasselt","author_inst":"UGent"},{"author_name":"Rudi De Raedt","author_inst":"UGent"},{"author_name":"Eva Van den Bussche","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Jain","author_inst":"Clinical Development Services Agency"},{"author_name":"Sachee Tainwala Agrawal","author_inst":"T.N.

In response to its world-wide outbreak radical measures were taken by governments across the world including curfew, quarantine, travel bans, social distancing, work place and school closures, etc, to reduce the transmission of the virus. These measures led to dramatic social and economic changes for the general population, in addition to the fears and worries related to the disease and its contraction. First studies report the impact of the pandemic on mental well-being of the general population showing increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In this study, we compare the impact of the pandemic on two European countries: the UK and Germany, which reported their first cases within a week. 241 residents of the UK and 541 residents of Germany filled in an online survey, including questions on COVID-19 exposure, impact on financial situation and work, substance and media consumption, self-reported mental and physical health, as well as including two clinical questionnaires, the general mental health Symptom Check List-27 (SCL-27) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. Data collection was completed between 27\/04\/20-31\/05\/20. We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on their health, financial situation and their families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, with a higher percentage being above cut-off. Interestingly, however, we found that German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. Generally, we found that a younger age, being female, lower education, poorer mental and physical health before the pandemic, as well as more social media and substance consumption was associated with a higher clinical risk. This research shows strong differences between two economically and culturally similar countries, but as 25% of both German and UK responders reported a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20-50% of German and UK responders reached the clinical cut-off for depressive, dysthymic and anxieties, it specifically shows the need for health emergency tailored intervention systems to assist not only people vulnerable for mental health problems, but also large proportions of the general public.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Franziska Knolle","author_inst":"Technical University Munich"},{"author_name":"Lisa Ronan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Graham K Murray","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Marie-Anne Vanderhasselt","author_inst":"UGent"},{"author_name":"Rudi De Raedt","author_inst":"UGent"},{"author_name":"Eva Van den Bussche","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Jain","author_inst":"Clinical Development Services Agency"},{"author_name":"Sachee Tainwala Agrawal","author_inst":"T.N.

It is also increasingly clear that airborne transmission is an important contributor to rapid spreading of the disease. In this paper, we discuss the processes of droplet generation by exhalation, their potential transformation into airborne particles by evaporation, transport over long distances by the exhaled puff and by ambient air turbulence, and final inhalation by the receiving host as interconnected multiphase flow processes. A simple model for the time evolution of droplet\/aerosol concentration is presented based on a theoretical analysis of the relevant physical processes. The modeling framework along with detailed experiments and simulations can be used to study a wide variety of scenarios involving breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing and in a number of environmental conditions, as humid or dry atmosphere, confined or open environment. Although a number of questions remain open on the physics of evaporation and coupling with persistence of the virus, it is clear that with a more reliable understanding of the underlying flow physics of virus transmission one can set the foundation for an improved methodology in designing case-specific social distancing and infection control guidelines.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S Balachandar","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Stephane Zaleski","author_inst":"Sorbonne"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Soldati","author_inst":"TU Wien"},{"author_name":"Goodarz Ahmadi","author_inst":"Clarkson University"},{"author_name":"Lydia Bourouiba","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Eva Van den Bussche","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Jain","author_inst":"Clinical Development Services Agency"},{"author_name":"Sachee Tainwala Agrawal","author_inst":"T.N.

Our goal is to extract the characteristics distinguishing between those COVID-19 patients that improve and those who die. In our approach, we select the relevant features using the algorithm of Boruta, a wrapper framework that takes input from classifiers generating relevance assessment of the predictors. Using the extracted features, we train machine learning classifiers, including Random Forests, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. We assess the performance of the classifiers using Precision-Recall and ROC analysis, establishing the ranges at which risk assessment permits effective decision-making. Our research highlights that local regions present unique sets of essential features, that it is possible to construct effective classifiers based on clinical data, and that an ensemble of classifiers results in the best performing discriminant.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joaquin Salas","author_inst":"Instituto Politecnico Nacional"},{"author_name":"Dagoberto Pulido","author_inst":"Instituto Politecnico Nacional"},{"author_name":"Omar Montoya","author_inst":"Instituto Politecnico Nacional"},{"author_name":"Isaac Ruiz","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Lydia Bourouiba","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Eva Van den Bussche","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Jain","author_inst":"Clinical Development Services Agency"},{"author_name":"Sachee Tainwala Agrawal","author_inst":"T.N.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic context. Methods We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. Results The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], mild Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]). HRSV was the predominant virus involved in multiple detection and most codetections were HRSV + RV 7.1%, 95% CI [4.6; 9.9]) and HRSV + HBoV 4.5%, 95% CI [2.4; 7.3]). Conclusions The present study has shown that HRSV is the main cause of bronchiolitis in children, we also have Rhinovirus, and Bocavirus which also play a significant role. No study has reported the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 in children with bronchiolitis to date.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastien Kenmoe","author_inst":"Centre Pasteur of Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Cyprien Kengne-Nde","author_inst":"National AIDS Control Committee, Epidemiological Surveillance, Evaluation and Research Unit, P.O.
