The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. Methods: We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Tromsoe, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Results: We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04-0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01-0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what Ferguson et al. have previously estimated for influenza pandemics [1]. Conclusion: We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R-estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools. For countries that have not opened schools yet, planned interventions, such as the opening of selected schools, can be useful to infer general knowledge about children-to-children transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Rypdal","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Veronika Gjertsen Rypdal","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Per Kirsten Jakobsen","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Elinor Ytterstad","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Ola Lovsletten","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Claus Klingenberg","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Rypdal","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175059","rel_title":"An Analysis of Self-reported Longcovid Symptoms on Twitter","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175059","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives: A majority of patients suffering from acute COVID-19 are expected to recover symptomatically and functionally. However there are reports that some people continue to experience symptoms even beyond the stage of acute infection. This phenomenon has been called longcovid. Study design: This study attempted to analyse symptoms reported by users on twitter self-identifying as longcovid. Methods: The search was carried out using the twitter public streaming application programming interface using a relevant search term. Results: We could identify 89 users with usable data in the tweets posted by them. A majority of users described multiple symptoms the most common of which were fatigue, shortness of breath, pain and brainfog\/concentration difficulties. The most common course of symptoms was episodic. Conclusions: Given the public health importance of this issue, the study suggests that there is a need to better study post acute-COVID symptoms.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shubh Mohan Singh","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh India"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Reddy","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh India"},{"author_name":"Per Kirsten Jakobsen","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Elinor Ytterstad","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Ola Lovsletten","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Claus Klingenberg","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Rypdal","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20167452","rel_title":"Abusers indoors and coronavirus outside: an examination of public discourse about COVID-19 and family violence on Twitter using machine learning","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20167452","rel_abs":"Purpose: This brief report aims to provide the first large-scale analysis of public discourse regarding family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. Method: We analyzed 301,606 Tweets related to family violence and COVID-19 from April 12 to July 16, 2020, for this study. We used the machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and identified salient themes, topics, and representative Twitter examples. Results: We extracted nine themes on family violence and COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the Impact of COVID-19 on family violence (e.g., rising rates, hotline calls increased, murder & homicide); (2) the types (e.g., child abuse, domestic violence, sexual violence) and (3) forms of family violence (e.g., physical aggression, coercive control); (4) risk factors of family violence (e.g., alcohol abuse, financial constraints, gun, quarantine); (5) victims of family violence (e.g., LGBTQ, women, and women of color, children); (6) social services of family violence (e.g., hotlines, social workers, confidential services, shelters, funding); (7) law enforcement response (e.g., 911 calls, police arrest, protective orders, abuse reports); (8) Social movement\/ awareness (e.g., support victims, raise awareness); and (9) domestic violence-related news (e.g., Tara Reade, Melissa Derosa). Conclusions: The COVID-19 has an impact on family violence. This report overcomes the limitation of existing scholarship that lacks data for consequences of COVID-19 on family violence. We contribute to the understanding of family violence during the pandemic by providing surveillance in Tweets, which is essential to identify potentially effective policy programs in offering targeted support for victims and survivors and preparing for the next wave.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Xue","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Junxiang Chen","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Ran Hu","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tingshao Zhu","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Claus Klingenberg","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Rypdal","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20173369","rel_title":"Outcomes of Persons With COVID-19 in Hospitals With and Without Standard Treatment With (Hydroxy)chloroquine","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20173369","rel_abs":"Objective To compare survival of subjects with COVID-19 treated in hospitals that either did or did not routinely treat patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Methods We analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates ranged from February 27th 2020, to May 15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated subjects with (hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity, and the use of steroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome, including dexamethasone. Results Among 1893 included subjects, 21-day mortality was 23.4% in 1552 subjects treated in hospitals that routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 17.0% in 341 subjects that were treated in hospitals that did not. In the adjusted Cox-regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95%CI 0.88-1.55). When stratified by actually received treatment in individual subjects, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.25-2.01) in the full model. Conclusions After adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, compared with hospitals that did not. We compared outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of indication bias. This study adds evidence against the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edgar JG Peters","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Didier Collard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Sander van Assen","author_inst":"Treant zorggroep"},{"author_name":"Martijn Beudel","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marije K Bomers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Buijs","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lianne de Haan","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Wouter de Ruijter","author_inst":"Noordwest ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"Renee Douma","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Paul WG Elbers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"A Goorhuis","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"N C Gritters van den Oever","author_inst":"Treant Zorggroep"},{"author_name":"G HH Knarren","author_inst":"Viecurie MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"H S Moeniralam","author_inst":"St Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"R LM Mostard","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M JR Quanjel","author_inst":"St. Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"A C Reidinga","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"R Renckens","author_inst":"Noordwest Ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"J PW van den Bergh","author_inst":"Viecuri MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"Imro N Vlasveld","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonne J Sikkens","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174318","rel_title":"Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Southwest Ethiopia.","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174318","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals which can affect people physically and psychologically. The older people and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness and death. Objective the aim of this study was to determine Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Bench-Sheko,West Omo and Keffa Zones, southwest Ethiopia Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was applied among 613 adults with chronic disease. A simple sampling technique was applied. Correlational analysis was used to determine the relationship between the COVID-19 related stress score and coping strategy types. To measure the strength of association between dependent variables and independent variables and Pearson coefficients (r) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Finally, the variable, which shows statistical significance (p-value < 0.05 cut point) were used to quantify the associations among variables. Results: Around 613 participants of 96% response rate were participated. About 68.4% were moderately stressed; low stress was 17.8% and severe stress was 13.9 %. Covid-19 related perceived stress score were positively associated with coping strategies types of like sell-distraction, active coping, denial, emotional support, behavioral disengagement, venting, and use of instrument, positive reframing, self-blaming, planning, humoring and religion. The most preferable types of coping strategies were religious, instrumental and active coping strategies and while the least used were substance used. Conclusion: Significant numbers of participants were suffered from severe perceived stress due to covid-19 outbreak in this study area. Both adaptive and maladaptive Coping strategy types were significantly associated with stress. Substance use and self-blaming were the types coping strategies which were not associated with perceived stress.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abel Girma","author_inst":"Mizan-Tepi university"},{"author_name":"Ermias Ayalew","author_inst":"mizan-tepi university"},{"author_name":"Sander van Assen","author_inst":"Treant zorggroep"},{"author_name":"Martijn Beudel","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marije K Bomers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Buijs","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lianne de Haan","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Wouter de Ruijter","author_inst":"Noordwest ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"Renee Douma","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Paul WG Elbers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"A Goorhuis","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"N C Gritters van den Oever","author_inst":"Treant Zorggroep"},{"author_name":"G HH Knarren","author_inst":"Viecurie MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"H S Moeniralam","author_inst":"St Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"R LM Mostard","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M JR Quanjel","author_inst":"St. Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"A C Reidinga","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"R Renckens","author_inst":"Noordwest Ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"J PW van den Bergh","author_inst":"Viecuri MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"Imro N Vlasveld","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonne J Sikkens","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20173393","rel_title":"Pre-COVID-19 humoral immunity to common coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20173393","rel_abs":"It is currently unknown whether acquired immunity to common alpha- and beta-coronaviruses provides cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2.

In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW). Methods We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State. We routinely collect data on occupation and exposures to suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results From March 1 2020 through June 2020, 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+\/-19 years, 53% male) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and known HCW status visited the ED. This included 193 (6.8%) known HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) non-HCWs. Compared with non-HCW, HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118\/193 vs 1211\/2649, P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161\/193 vs 946\/2649, P<0.001), but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of tachypnea (12\/193 vs 426\/2649, P<0.01), hypoxemia (15\/193 vs 564\/2649, P<0.01), bilateral opacities on imaging (38\/193 vs 1189\/2649, P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6\/193 vs 532\/2649, P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more frequent in HCW 154\/193: 80% vs 1275\/2649: 48% p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38\/193 20% vs 1264\/2694 47%, P<0.001), ICU admissions (7\/193 3% vs 321\/2694 12%, P<0.001), need for IMV (6\/193 3% vs 321\/2694 12%, P<0.001) and mortality (2\/193 1% vs 219\/2694 8%, P<0.01) were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9) than non HCW.

In the United States National Capital Region, over 2,000 cases were reported within three weeks of its first detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the region. By correlating genetic information to disease phenotype, we also aimed to gain insight into any correlation between viral genotype and case severity or transmissibility. Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing of clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in March 2020 by the Johns Hopkins Health System, building on methods developed by the ARTIC network. We analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and the global phylogeny to understand early establishment of the virus within the region. Results: We analyzed 620 samples from the Johns Hopkins Health System collected between March 11-31, 2020, comprising 37.3% of the total cases in Maryland during this period. We selected 143 of these samples for sequencing, generating 114 complete viral genomes. These genomes belonged to all five major Nextstrain-defined clades, suggesting multiple introductions into the region and underscoring the diversity of the regional epidemic. We also found that clinically severe cases had genomes belonging to all of these clades. Conclusions: We established a pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within the Johns Hopkins Health system, which enabled us to capture the significant viral diversity present in the region as early as March 2020. Efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter M.

Phase I\/II vaccine clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent sera have all shown promise. However, these efforts often require extensive screening with the live virus under onerous high biocontainment conditions (BSL-3). Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) remain the gold standard for evaluating the anti-viral potency of antibodies and entry inhibitors. The proliferation of pseudotyped virus systems that can be used in BSL-2 compatible VNAs is a positive development. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how the findings are presented, making inter-group comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using VSVdeltaG based CoV-2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) that can be robustly produced at scale. We used our CoV2pp to interrogate the role of exogenous and endogenous proteases in CoV-2-S mediated entry and standardized our VNA based on that understanding. Our CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S ELISA and live virus neutralizations in a validated set of patient sera. Our system was subsequently validated by three independent groups as an out-of-the-box VNA. More than 120 patient sera were screened, and we report descriptive statistics for absolute (abs) IC50, IC80, and IC90 values from all positive patient sera. Lastly, we used our CoV2pp in a screen to identify ultrapermissive 293T clones that stably express ACE2 or ACE2+TMPRSS2. When used in combination with our CoV2pp, we can now produce CoV2pp sufficient for 150,000 standardized VNA\/week.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kasopefoluwa Y.

Reverse Transcriptase- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing usually requires a centralised laboratory and significant infrastructure. We describe the development and diagnostic accuracy assessment of a novel, rapid point-of-care RT-PCR test, the DnaNudge platform CovidNudge test, which requires no laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs are inserted directly into a cartridge which contains all reagents and components required for RT-PCR reactions, including multiple technical replicates of seven SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (rdrp1, rdrp2, e-gene, n-gene, n1, n2 and n3) and human ribonuclease P (RNaseP) as a positive control. Between April and May 2020, swab samples were tested in parallel using the CovidNudge direct-to-cartridge platform and standard laboratory RT-PCR using swabs in viral transport medium. Samples were collected from three groups: self-referred healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 (Group 1, n=280\/386; 73%); patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 (Group 2, n=15\/386; 4%) and hospital inpatient admissions with or without suspected COVID-19 (Group 3, n=91\/386; 23%). Results Of 386 paired samples tested across all groups, 67 tested positive on the CovidNudge platform and 71 with standard laboratory RT-PCR. The sensitivity of the test varied by group (Group 1 93% [84-98%], Group 2 100% [48-100%] and Group 3 100% [29-100%], giving an average sensitivity of 94.4% (95% confidence interval 86-98%) and an overall specificity of 100% (95%CI 99-100%; Group 1 100% [98-100%]; Group 2 100% [69-100%] and Group 3 100% [96-100%]). Point of care testing performance was comparable during a period of high (25%) and low (3%) background prevalence. Amplification of the viral nucleocapsid (n1, n2, n3) targets were most sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV2, with the assay able to detect 1x104 viral particles in a single swab. Conclusions The CovidNudge platform offers a sensitive, specific and rapid point of care test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 without laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. The implementation of such a device could be used to enable rapid decisions for clinical care and testing programs.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malick M

Of particular interest are the daily rates and cumulative number of new infections, as they are monitored in infected societies, and the influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions due to different lockdown measures as well as their subsequent lifting on these infections. Estimating quantitatively the influence of a later lifting of the interventions on the resulting increase in the case numbers is important to discriminate this increase from the onset of a second wave. The recently discovered new analytical solutions of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model allow for such forecast and the testing of lockdown and lifting interventions as they hold for arbitrary time dependence of the infection rate.

Tocilizumab has an antagonist effect on the IL-6 receptor. With present review and metanalysis, we intend to update the current status on the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of Covid 19 infections in the published literature of case series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following inclusion criteria were used: (i) case series studies (number of reported patients in each study equal to or greater than ten (ii) use of tocilizumab alone or in combination with standard of care therapy (iii) Covid 19 adult patients (iv) the studies with endpoints on all-cause mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvements. Data synthesis and statistical analysis Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model and the DerSimonian and Laird method. RESULTS 18 were selected for the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). 14 studies were retrospective and 4 were prospective Meta-analysis The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab was 21% (251\/1212) Asymmetric funnel plot in the cylindrical form due to publication bias In conclusion the present synthesis provide us useful insights with the other available evidence to refine our strategy and equip ourselves effectively with tocilizumab to defeat COVID 19 to save humanity. Limitations The included studies utilized varied doses of tocilizumab (single or double), and duration drug availability issues emerged in some centers, which may have influenced both sample sizes and study designs. Clinical implications: Incorporated studies without control groups into systematic reviews and quantitative synthesis especially when there are no other studies to consider can provide information for formulating effective treatment strategies for management of COVID 19 infections through the use of tocilizumab.

Our secondary aim was to compare physical activity estimates between objectively measured and self-reported physical activity level. Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we assessed physical activity level using accelerometers and a validated questionnaire in 33 post-bariatric patients who reported to be adherent (n=15) or not (n=18) to social distancing measures. Results: Patients adherent to social distancing measures spent more time in sedentary behavior (1.1 hours\/day [95%CI: 0.1, 2.2]; p=0.045) and less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (-12.2 min\/day [95%CI: -23.8, -0.6]; p=0.040) compared to non-adherent ones. No difference was observed for light-intensity physical activity. Bland-Altman analysis comparing objective and subjective physical activity estimates showed a bias for time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of 2.8 hours\/day and 8.5 min\/day, respectively. Conclusion: Post-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 outbreak were more inactive and sedentary than non-adherent ones. Additionally, questionnaire data widely underestimated sedentary behavior. Strategies to increase or at least sustain physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients exposed to social distancing measures are necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Rezende","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana Jessica Pinto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Karla Fabiana Goessler","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carolina Nicoletti","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Perri Esteves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Genario","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gersiel Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marco Aurelio Santo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cleva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jiayang Sun","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Flower","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Judith Bedzo-Nutakor","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Maisarah Amran","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Rachael Quinlan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sports medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20171256","rel_title":"Has COVID-19 Hurt Resident Education?

Residents have faced significant changes in work schedules, deployment to COVID-19 units, and alterations to didactics. This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on resident perception of their own education within the Nuvance Health Network. Methods: We conducted an observational study assessing resident perception of changes in education and lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was developed to assess the quality and quantity of resident education during this time and administered anonymously to all residents within the healthcare network. Results: Eighty-four (68%) residents responded to the survey from five different specialties, including general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and radiology. The average change in hours per week performing clinical work was -5.6 hours (SD=16.8), in time studying was +0.02 hours (SD=4.6), in weekly didactics was -1.7 hours (SD=3.1), and in attending involvement was -1.2 hours (SD=2.3). Additionally, 32% of residents expressed concern that the pandemic has diminished their preparedness to become an attending, 13% expressed concern about completing graduation requirements, and 3% felt they would need an additional year of training. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, residents perceived that time spent on organized didactics\/conferences decreased and that attending physicians are less involved in education. Furthermore, the majority of residents felt that the quality of didactic education diminished as a result of the pandemic. Surprisingly, while many residents expressed concerns about being prepared to become an attending, few were concerned about completing graduation requirements or needing an extra year of education. In light of these findings, it is critical to devote attention to the effects of the pandemic on residents' professional trajectories and create innovative opportunities for improving education during this challenging time.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Ostapenko","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samantha McPeck","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Shawn Liechty","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kleiner","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Perri Esteves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Genario","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gersiel Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marco Aurelio Santo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cleva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jiayang Sun","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Flower","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Judith Bedzo-Nutakor","author_inst":"DnaNudge Ltd, Translation and Innovation Hub, Imperial College White City Campus, London"},{"author_name":"Maisarah Amran","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Rachael Quinlan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.250258","rel_title":"Inhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 main protease by tafenoquine in vitro","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.250258","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has taken a huge toll on human lives and the global economy. Therefore, effective treatments against this disease are urgently needed. Here, we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput screening platform to screen compound libraries to identify drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), in particular those which are FDA-approved, to be used immediately to treat patients with COVID-19. Mpro has been shown to be one of the most important drug targets among SARS-related coronaviruses as impairment of Mpro blocks processing of viral polyproteins which halts viral replication in host cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-malarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ) induces significant conformational change in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and diminishes its protease activity. Specifically, TFQ reduces the -helical content of Mpro, which converts it into an inactive form. Moreover, TFQ greatly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture system. Hence, the current study provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of action of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Moreover, the low clinical toxicity of TFQ and its strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 should warrant further testing in clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yeh Chen","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hao Yang","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li-Min Huang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Chuan Wang","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Shin Yang","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Liang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Hui Hou","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Ling Tsai","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Zhen Chou","author_inst":"Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bao-Yue Huang","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chian-Fang Hung","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Lin Hung","author_inst":"Program of Digital Health Innovation, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shing Chen","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ping Chiang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Der-Yang Cho","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, China Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Long-Bin Jeng","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Hai Tsai","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mien-Chie Hung","author_inst":"Drug Development Center, Research Center for Cancer Biology and Center for Molecular Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.248880","rel_title":"In plain sight: the role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in COVID-19 pathogenesis and therapeutics.","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.248880","rel_abs":"Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by endogenous and exogenous proteases. These proteases proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and are key modulators of virus tropism. We show that SARS-CoV-2 naive serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) as the major serum protease inhibitor that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2. AAT inhibition of protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro occurs at concentrations far below what is present in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting that AAT effects are physiologically relevant. Moreover, AAT deficiency affects up to 20% of the population and its symptomatic manifestations coincides with many risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the effects that AAT may have on viral entry itself, we argue that the anti-inflammatory and coagulation regulatory activity of AAT have implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 tissue restriction, convalescent plasma therapies, and even potentially AAT therapy.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kasopefoluwa Y Oguntuyo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christian S Stevens","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Mohammed NA Siddiquey","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Robert M Schilke","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Woolard","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Zhang","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Acklin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Ikegame","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chuan-tien Hung","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jean K Lim","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert W Cross","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Thomas W Geisbert","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Stanimir S Ivanov","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Jeremy P Kamil","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Long-Bin Jeng","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Hai Tsai","author_inst":"School of Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mien-Chie Hung","author_inst":"Drug Development Center, Research Center for Cancer Biology and Center for Molecular Medicine, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Keira Skolimowska","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Robert Klaber","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gary Davies","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"David Muir","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174508","rel_title":"Data Mining Approach to Analyze Covid19 Dataset of Brazilian Patients","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174508","rel_abs":"The pandemic originated by coronavirus(covid19), name coined by World Health Organization during the first month in 2020.

We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the adopted respiratory strategy. Methods: Population-based cohort study including all COVID-19 patients (26\/02\/2020-18\/04\/2020) within Rimini Italian province. Hospitalized patients were classified according to the maximum level of respiratory support: oxygen supplementation (group Oxygen), NIV (group NIV-only), IMV (group IMV-only), and IMV after a NIV trial (group IMV-after-NIV). Sixty-day mortality risk was estimated with a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted by age, sex, and administration of steroids, canakinumab, and tocilizumab. Findings: We identified 1,424 symptomatic patients: 520 (36.5%) were hospitalized, the remaining 904 (63.5%) were treated at home with no 60-days death. According to the respiratory support, 408 (78.5%) were assigned to Oxygen, 46 (8.8%) to NIV-only, 25 (4.8%) to IMV-after-NIV, and 41 (7.9%) to IMV-only groups. There was no significant difference in the P\/F at IMV inception among IMV-after-NIV and IMV-only groups (p=0.9). Overall 60-day mortality was 24.2% (Oxygen: 23.0%; NIV-only: 19.6%; IMV-after-NIV: 32.0%; IMV-only: 36.6%; p = 0.165).

G-CSF is both a growth factor and cytokine that initiates proliferation and differentiation of mature granulocytes. However, the clinical impact of neutropenia and G-CSF use in cancer patients, who are also afflicted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains unknown. Methods: An observational cohort of 304 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was assembled to investigate links between concurrent neutropenia (N=55) and G-CSF administration (N=16) on COVID-19-associated respiratory failure and death. These factors were assessed as time-dependent predictors using an extended Cox model, controlling for age and underlying cancer diagnosis. To determine whether the degree of granulocyte response to G-CSF affected outcomes, a similar model was constructed with patients that received G-CSF, categorized into high- and low-response, based on the level of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rise 24 hours after growth factor administration. Results: Neutropenia (ANC < 1 K\/mcL) during COVID-19 course was not independently associated with severe respiratory failure or death (HR: 0.71, 95% Cl: 0.34-1.50, P value: 0.367) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. When controlling for neutropenia, G-CSF administration was associated with increased need for high oxygen supplementation and death (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06-8.28, P value: 0.038). This effect was predominantly seen in patients that exhibited a high response to G-CSF based on their ANC increase post-G-CSF administration (HR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.61-16.64, P value: 0.006). Conclusion: Possible risks versus benefits of G-CSF administration should be weighed in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19 infection, as G-CSF may lead to worsening clinical and respiratory status in this setting.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sejal Morjaria","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Allen Zhang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Anna Kaltsas MD","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Rekha Parameswaran","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dhruvkumar Patel","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhou","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Predmore","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Rocio Perez Johnston","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Justin Jee","author_inst":"MSKCC"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174524","rel_title":"Mortality Associated With Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174524","rel_abs":"Objective: The need for critical care, hemodynamic support, renal replacement therapy, and mechanical ventilation have emerged as key features of the SARS-nCoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary aim of this study was to determine the in-hospital mortality rate of mechanically ventilated patients. We also sought to determine the risk of in-hospital mortality by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and body mass index. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the mortality rate among inpatient adults with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation in the Nuvance Health system between March 1, 2020 and July 17, 2020. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older, had a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, were admitted to hospitals within the Nuvance Health network (7 hospitals), and were on mechanical ventilation at any time during their inpatient stay. Results: Overall mortality in our cohort of 304 patients was 53.3 percent. Multivariable logistic regression including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and BMI demonstrated patients over 71 years old had greater risk of mortality compared to patients ages 61-70, and females had half the risk compared to males. There was no significant difference in risk of mortality given race, ethnicity, or BMI. Conclusions: In adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care, advanced age (>71 years old) and male gender are associated with increased risk of mortality. This information contributes to a collective body of evidence to support ongoing planning and decision-making among clinicians and for directed infection prevention programming.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Zimmerman","author_inst":"Division of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stroever","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Timothy Burton","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Karri Hester","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Minha Kim","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Ryan Fahy","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Corbitt","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174631","rel_title":"Forecasting United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Through Machine Learning","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174631","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has become a great national security problem for the United States and many other countries, where public policy and healthcare decisions are based on the several models for the prediction of the future deaths and cases of COVID-19. While the most commonly used models for COVID-19 include epidemiological models and Gaussian curve-fitting models, recent literature has indicated that these models could be improved by incorporating machine learning. However, within this research on potential machine learning models for COVID-19 forecasting, there has been a large emphasis on providing an array of different types of machine learning models rather than optimizing a single one. In this research, we suggest and optimize a linear machine learning model with a gradient-based optimizer for the prediction of future COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States. We also suggest that a hybrid of a machine learning model for shorter range predictions and a Gaussian curve-fitting model or an epidemiological model for longer range predictions could greatly increase the accuracy of COVID-19 forecasting.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anaiy Somalwar","author_inst":"BASIS Independent Silicon Valley"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stroever","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Timothy Burton","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Karri Hester","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Minha Kim","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Ryan Fahy","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Corbitt","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174888","rel_title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research: an ad hoc survey among investigators in Germany","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174888","rel_abs":"Objectives: To gain insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research projects, using projects from a selected funding programme in Germany as an example. Design: Online survey Setting: Lockdowns and social distancing policies impact upon clinical and public health research in various forms, especially if unrelated to COVID-19. Research institutions have reduced onsite activities, data is often collected remotely, and during the height of the crisis, clinical researchers were partially forced to abandon their projects in favour of front-line care and crisis response. Participants: 120 investigators of health research projects across Germany, performed between 15 and 25 May 2020. Results: The response rate (78%) showed that the survey generated significant interest among investigators. 85 responses were included for analysis, and the majority of investigators (93%) reported that their projects were affected by the pandemic, with many (80%) stating that data collection was not possible as planned, and they could not carry out interventions as planned (67%). Other impacts were caused by staff being unavailable, for example through child or elder care commitments or because of COVID-19 quarantine or illness. Investigators also reported that publications were delayed or not feasible at all (56%), and some experienced problems with PhD or Masters theses (18%). The majority of investigators had mitigation strategies in place such as adjustment of data collection methods using digital tools (46%) or of project implementation in general (46%), others made changes in research design or research questions (27%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted upon health research projects. The main challenge is now to mitigate negative effects and to improve long-term resilience in health research. The pandemic has also acted as a driver of innovation and change, for example by accelerating the use of digital methods.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanja Bratan","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research"},{"author_name":"Heike Aichinger","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Brkic","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research"},{"author_name":"Jana Rueter","author_inst":"Medical Sociology, Department for Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christian Apfelbacher","author_inst":"Institute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg"},{"author_name":"Julika Loss","author_inst":"Medical Sociology, Department for Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg; Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Corbitt","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174706","rel_title":"England's Lockdown vs. Sweden's Herd Immunity: A Comparison of the Daily New COVID-19 Cases and Related Deaths Using Comparative Interrupted Time Series Analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174706","rel_abs":"Background: There is a lack of empirical evidence that lockdowns decrease daily cases of COVID-19 and related mortality compared to herd immunity. England implemented a delayed lockdown on March 23, 2020, but Sweden did not. We aim to examine the effect of lockdown on daily COVID-19 cases and related deaths during the first 100 days post-lockdown. Methods: We compared daily cases of COVID-19 infection and related mortality in England and Sweden before and after lockdown intervention using a comparative-interrupted time series analysis. The period included was from COVID-19 pandemic onset till June 30, 2020. Results: The adjusted-rate of daily COVID-19 infections was eight cases\/10,000,000 person higher in England than Sweden before lockdown order (95% CI: 2-14, P=0.01). On the day of intervention (lagged lockdown), England had 693 more COVID-19 cases\/10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 467-920, P<0.001). Compared to the pre-intervention period, the adjusted daily confirmed cases rate decreased by 19 cases\/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 13-26, P<0.001). There was a rate excess of 1.5 daily deaths\/ 10,000,000 person in England compared to Sweden pre-intervention (95% CI: 1-2, P<0.001). The increased mortality rate resulted in 50 excess deaths\/ 10,000,000 person related to COVID-19 in England compared to Sweden on the day of lockdown (95% CI: 30-71, P<0.001). Post-intervention, the rate of daily deaths in England decreased by two deaths\/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 1-3, P<0.001). During phases one and two of lockdown lifting in England, there was no rebound increase in daily cases or deaths compared to Sweden. Conclusion: The lockdown order implemented in England on March 23, 2020, effectively decreased the daily new cases rate and related mortality compared to Sweden. There was no short-term increase in COVID-19 cases and related-deaths after the phases one and two of the lifting of restrictions in England compared to Sweden.

With the rise of potential infections in the healthcare facilities and the transmission nature of the current volantly evolving COVID 19, consistent and correct disinfections of these devices after each use should not be pardoned. This study, therefore, describes the level of stethoscope and non infrared thermometer disinfection practices among physicians and determines its associated factors during the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was circulated using an anonymous and self-reporting questionnaire via Google form with a consent form appended to it. Results: Four hundred twenty-two physicians participated (62.80% medical doctors, 33.65% seniors, and 3.55% residents). The proportion of stethoscope and non Infrared thermometer disinfections after every use was 13.9% (95%CI: 10.9-17.6) and 20.4% (95%CI: 16.7-24.5), respectively. In adjusted analyses, taking COVID-19 training (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.52; 95% [Confidence Interval (CI)]: 1.29-4.92) and the availability of stethoscope disinfection materials at the workplace (AOR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.29-7.10) were significantly increased the odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use. The odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use was significantly decreased for those who reported the use of shared stethoscope (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.92). Among the physicians, disinfection after every use was significantly higher in resident physicians compared to those of general practitioners for both stethoscope (AOR: 4.61; 95%CI: 1.29-16.52) and non Infrared thermometers (AOR: 7.10; 95%CI: 2.30-21.95). Conclusion: Only a wee share of the respondents reported that they have disinfected their stethoscopes and non-infrared thermometers after every use possibly jeopardizing both patients and clinicians safety, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic and these results must be sternly dealt with. Provisions of training and securing constant and available stethoscope disinfection supplies can significantly increase disinfection practices among the physicians after every use.

It is theoretically proved that the basic reproduction number is a nonlinear combination of parameters regarding disease transmission, intervention and economy effect, which totally determines the stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. Further results indicate the existence of interaction and mutual restraint among the transmission, intervention and economy, in which strong coupling of COVID-19 and economy would trigger disease outbreak and form poverty trap, while adaptive isolation of at-risk population could effectively reduce morbidity at the cost of least economic loss. Our findings can offer new insights to improve the intervention strategies against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaowang Zhang","author_inst":"Guilin University of Electronic Technology"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Lin","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guanghu Zhu","author_inst":"Guilin University of Electronic Technology"},{"author_name":"Abdi Tesemma","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Surgery, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Bruce John Edward Quisido","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Nursing, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Julika Loss","author_inst":"Medical Sociology, Department for Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg; Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Corbitt","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Department of Innovation and Research, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.249847","rel_title":"Open Science Saves Lives: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.249847","rel_abs":"In the last decade Open Science principles, such as Open Access, study preregistration, use of preprints, making available data and code, and open peer review, have been successfully advocated for and are being slowly adopted in many different research communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic many publishers and researchers have sped up their adoption of some of these Open Science practices, sometimes embracing them fully and sometimes partially or in a sub-optimal manner. In this article, we express concerns about the violation of some of the Open Science principles and its potential impact on the quality of research output. We provide evidence of the misuses of these principles at different stages of the scientific process. We call for a wider adoption of Open Science practices in the hope that this work will encourage a broader endorsement of Open Science principles and serve as a reminder that science should always be a rigorous process, reliable and transparent, especially in the context of a pandemic where research findings are being translated into practice even more rapidly.

Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25 rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and greatly extend our knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"Department of Zoonosis, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xian-Dan Lin","author_inst":"Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hai-Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miao-Ruo Wang","author_inst":"Longquan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Qing Guan","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9mence Leyrat","author_inst":"Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nicastro","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Nuvance Health"},{"author_name":"Miguel Perales","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Guerra","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuliani","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elena Mosconi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Guarino","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Elisa Marchionni","author_inst":"Dept of Infectious Diseases Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romgna"},{"author_name":"Gianfilippo Gangitano","author_inst":"Dept of Emergency Medicine, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Valentini","author_inst":"Dept of Pneumology  Infermi Hospital,  AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Luca Giampaolo","author_inst":"Dept of  Internal Medicine Cervesi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Francesco Muratore","author_inst":"Dept of Radiology Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Dept. of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Infermi Hospital, AUSL della Romagna"},{"author_name":"Derrick W M Crook","author_inst":"NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Graham P Taylor","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nabeela Mughal","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genetics"}]}
