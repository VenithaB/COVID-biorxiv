The long duration of pathological laboratory tests and the wrong test results led the researchers to focus on different fields. Fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for effective interventions with COVID-19. The information obtained by using X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images is vital in making clinical diagnoses. Therefore it was aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray images. In this study, images belonging to 6 situations, including coronavirus images, are classified. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, it is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods. For this purpose, firstly, all the images in the dataset are extracted with the help of four feature extraction algorithms. These extracted features are combined in raw form. The unbalanced data problem is eliminated by producing feature vectors with the SMOTE algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially in order to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saban Ozturk","author_inst":"Amasya University"},{"author_name":"Umut Ozkaya","author_inst":"Konya Technical University"},{"author_name":"Mucahid Barstugan","author_inst":"Konya Technical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20049742","rel_title":"Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 infection from event attendance: Results from Louisiana, USA, two weeks preceding the national emergency declaration","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20049742","rel_abs":"In response to the mounting threat of COVID-19, we added questions to an ongoing food preference study held at Louisiana State University from March 3-12 of 2020. We asked 356 participants: (1) In your opinion, how likely is it that the spread of COVID-19 (the coronavirus) will cause a public health crisis in the United States? (2) How concerned are you that you will contract COVID-19 by attending events on campus? Participants' estimates of an impending national health crisis increased significantly during the study's second week (March 9-12) while concern about personally contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events increased only marginally during the study's final days. We find those expressing a higher likelihood of an impending national crisis were more concerned about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events, suggesting a possible transmission from perceptions of national-level events to perceived personal vulnerability via local exposure. However, about 30% of participants perceived that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis yet did not express concern about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more likely to be younger students who agreed to participate in response to recruitment using same-day flyer distribution. Women expressed a higher likelihood of an emerging national health crisis, although they were not more concerned than men that attending campus events would result in virus contraction. Other groups (e.g., white, students younger than 25, highest income group) displayed similar concern about a national-level crisis, yet were significantly less concerned about contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events than others. Also, participants randomly assigned to information emphasizing the national impacts of food waste expressed significantly greater concern of contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events. These results provide some initial insight about how people perceived national and personal risks in the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis in Louisiana.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ran Li","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Bingchen Yang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-see University"},{"author_name":"Jerrod Penn","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Bailey Houghtaling","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Witoon Prinyawiwatkul","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Brian Roe","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Danyi Qi","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20051284","rel_title":"Building an International Consortium for Tracking Coronavirus Health Status","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20051284","rel_abs":"Information is the most potent protective weapon we have to combat a pandemic, at both the individual and global level. For individuals, information can help us make personal decisions and provide a sense of security. For the global community, information can inform policy decisions and offer critical insights into the epidemic of COVID-19 disease. Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics. These sources may include self-reported health status through surveys (including mobile apps), results of diagnostic laboratory tests, and other static and real-time geospatial data. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak, identifying which factors control the rate of spreading, informing immediate policy decisions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control, and providing critical insight on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help individuals stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease. In the past few weeks, several initiatives across the globe have surfaced to use daily self-reported symptoms as a means to track disease spread, predict outbreak locations, guide population measures and help in the allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this paper is to put out a call to standardize these efforts and spark a collaborative effort to maximize the global gain while protecting participant privacy.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Core Member, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, United States"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Departments of Biostatistics and Statistics, Harvard T.H.

The Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long-term efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and high-income countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in LMICs, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in LMICs.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anita Shet","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USA"},{"author_name":"Debashree Ray","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USA"},{"author_name":"Neelika Malavige","author_inst":"University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Mathuram Santosham","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Naor Bar-Zeev","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"William E.

To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings. METHODS: We included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies. RESULTS: Where specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI\/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I2 29%, low certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 2 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person(OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I2 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence). DISCUSSION: Based on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julii Suzanne Brainard","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Natalia Jones","author_inst":"School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Iain Lake","author_inst":"School of Environmental Science, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Lee Hooper","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Paul Hunter","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"William E.

This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the 16th month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. The average containment level is approximately 50\\% during the 25-months period for vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly outperforms others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak. This work opens new perspectives to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics, and be used as a proof-of-concept in using mathematical modelling techniques to enlighten decision making and public health management in the early times of an outbreak.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramses Djidjou-Demasse","author_inst":"The French National Research Institute for Development (IRD)"},{"author_name":"Yannis Michalakis","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Marc Choisy","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Mircea T.

Several reports suggest that, in severe cases, COVID-19 may cause a hyperinflammatory 'cytokine storm'. However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID- 19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. Although mHLA-DR expression levels in COVID-19 patients were lower than those observed in healthy subjects, the extent of suppression was less pronounced than observed in bacterial septic shock patients. mHLA-DR expression kinetics revealed no change over time. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate more moderate innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients compared with bacterial septic shock patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears less pronounced in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthijs Kox","author_inst":"Radboud university medical centre"},{"author_name":"Tim Frenzel","author_inst":"Radboud university medical center"},{"author_name":"Jeroen Schouten","author_inst":"Radboud university medical center"},{"author_name":"Frank van de Veerdonk","author_inst":"Radboud university medical center"},{"author_name":"Hans J.P.M.

Knowledge about Aerosol spread is vital during the SARS-CoV-2-Pandemic. Methods: To evaluate feasibility we nebulized ultraviolet sensitive detergents into the artificial airway of a resuscitation dummy and performed CPR. The spread of the visualized aerosol was documented by a camera. In a second approach we applied nebulized detergents into human cadavers by an endotracheal tube and detected aerosol- spread during chest compressions the same way. We did recordings with undergoing compression- only-CPR, with a surgical mask and with an inserted laryngeal tube with and without a connected airway filter. Results: Most aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask deflected the spread. Inserting a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter lead to a remarkable reduction of aerosol-spread. Conclusion: The early insertion of a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter before starting chest compression may be good for two Things: the treatment of hypoxemia as the likeliest cause of cardiac arrest and for staff protection during CPR.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthias Ott","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfio Milazzo","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy & Developmental Biology INDB, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Stefan Liebau","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy & Developmental Biology INDB, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Christina Jaki","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Simulation Center STUPS"},{"author_name":"Tobias Schilling","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Krohn","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Johannes Heymer","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonatan H.

In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter.

Estimating the effects of interventions, such as transportation restrictions and quarantine measures, on the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Wuhan is critical for guiding future virus containment strategies. Since the exact number of COVID-19 infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. However, this means that it would not be possible to adequately estimate epidemiological parameters and the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all infected cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic as a consequence of a gradually increasing diagnostic capability. Methods: To overcome the limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. Results: Our model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as a two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the R_e from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). An improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1% - 43%) to 28% (95% CI 4% - 62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7% - 79%)).","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingbo LIANG","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Hsiang-Yu Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Wu","author_inst":"Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Dirk Udo Pfeiffer","author_inst":"Centre for Applied One Health Research and Policy Advice, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Tobias Schilling","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Krohn","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Johannes Heymer","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonatan H.

Our study aimed to evaluate the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures in daily life, and to identify communication channels used to acquire relevant information on COVID-19 in European countries. Design: A cross-sectional online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated on social media starting March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we compiled and categorized community containment measures enacted in each country by stringency (stage I-IV). Response collection continued for one week to explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified. Participants: In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). An additional 1,365 respondents completed the survey in the following week. Results: Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands were less likely to consider a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents did not only apply enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%), but also self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents largely reported being sufficiently informed about the COVID-19 outbreak and about behaviors to avoid infection (range across countries: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television (range: 53.0%-82.0%), newspapers (range: 31.0%-63.0%), official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%), and social media (range: 40.0%-55.8%). We observed no major changes in answers over time. Conclusions: In European countries, the degree of public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures was high and residents reported to be sufficiently informed by various communication channels. In March 2020, implementation of enacted and self-initiated measures differed between countries and were highest among Italian respondents, who were subjected to the most elaborate measures of social lockdown and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karien Meier","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Toivo Glatz","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Mathijs C Guijt","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marco Piccininni","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Merel van der Meulen","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Khaled Atmar","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne-Tess C Jolink","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jessica L Rohmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Amir H Zamanipoor Najafabadi","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"on behalf of the COVID-19 Survey Study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tal Bauman","author_inst":"Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, The Technion, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

Methods: Three types of hospital equipments demanded by severe COVID-19 patients are considered: available intensive care unit (ICU) beds, existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas. They are taken into account on a cumulative basis forming three levels of hospital equipment usage. Based on a mean duration of hospitalization for the disease, it is estimated the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and for the entire country for each level of hospital equipment usage. Furthermore, an exponential regression model is fitted by means of the daily national number of new documented patients. The prediction intervals for the number of new patients for certain days in the immediate future are then calculated and compared to the admissible daily demand for the three incremental groups of equipments. The data are made publicly available by the Brazilian federal government and are gathered and analyzed by means of the Python programming language. Results: 41% of the (adult) ICU beds in Brazil were available during 2019, indicating that this hospital equipment has not been on average operating near capacity in national numbers. Nevertheless, there is a marked heterogeneity in the absolute and relative numbers of available and existing ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and extra respirators between its states. Conclusions: The remarkable differences between states' hospital resources directly reflect into the number of possible daily admissions of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure for the three considered levels of hospital equipment usage. In national numbers, Brazil's health system is estimated to be capable of daily admitting 693, 1243 and 2166 severe patients under the three studied scenarios. The fitted model predicted that only the first limit, if any, would be reached.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Luis Barroso Cavalcante","author_inst":"Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts"},{"author_name":"Juliana Cristina Cardoso Ferreira","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Mathijs C Guijt","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marco Piccininni","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Merel van der Meulen","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Khaled Atmar","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne-Tess C Jolink","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jessica L Rohmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Amir H Zamanipoor Najafabadi","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"on behalf of the COVID-19 Survey Study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tal Bauman","author_inst":"Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, The Technion, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different US states. Findings suggest that if less than 60\\% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03\/23\/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75\\% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05\/31\/20) is about 232,000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17,200 ventilators on 04\/19\/2020.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanjay Mehrotra","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hamed Rahimian","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Masoud Barah","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Fengqiao Luo","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Karolina Schantz","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Atmar","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne-Tess C Jolink","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jessica L Rohmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Amir H Zamanipoor Najafabadi","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"on behalf of the COVID-19 Survey Study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tal Bauman","author_inst":"Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, The Technion, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-regression. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk factors. Results: The meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently predicted severe \/ critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity. Conclusions: Risk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case fatality rate of 7.4% after correcting for publication bias underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chanaka N Kahathuduwa","author_inst":"Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center"},{"author_name":"Chathurika S Dhanasekara","author_inst":"Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center"},{"author_name":"Shao-Hua Chin","author_inst":"Protech Pharmaservices Corporation"},{"author_name":"Fengqiao Luo","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Karolina Schantz","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Atmar","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne-Tess C Jolink","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jessica L Rohmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Amir H Zamanipoor Najafabadi","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"on behalf of the COVID-19 Survey Study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tal Bauman","author_inst":"Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, The Technion, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Okhuese Victor","author_inst":"Nasarawa State University"},{"author_name":"Chathurika S Dhanasekara","author_inst":"Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center"},{"author_name":"Shao-Hua Chin","author_inst":"Protech Pharmaservices Corporation"},{"author_name":"Fengqiao Luo","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Karolina Schantz","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Khaled Atmar","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne-Tess C Jolink","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jessica L Rohmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Amir H Zamanipoor Najafabadi","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"on behalf of the COVID-19 Survey Study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tal Bauman","author_inst":"Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, The Technion, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

Methods The most efficient pool size was determined to be 5 specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) for a total volume of 250 microliter l. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12-pools. Results All 25 pools were positive with Cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that two pools were positive followed by identification of two individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions\/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions. Conclusions When the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baha Abdalhamid","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Bilder","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Emily L McCutchen","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Steven H Hinrichs","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Scott A Koepsell","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter C Iwen","author_inst":"Nebraska Public Health Laboratory, University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne-Tess C Jolink","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jessica L Rohmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Amir H Zamanipoor Najafabadi","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"on behalf of the COVID-19 Survey Study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tal Bauman","author_inst":"Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, The Technion, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

The aim of this study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed. Results: Of 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge. Conclusions: ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Fu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Fei","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shen Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui-Xian Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhu-Xia Tan","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Die Li","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Li","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ming-Feng Han","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Yong Li","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

Several reports observed a reduction of lymphocytes among COVID-19 patients. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: All 192 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patient's prognosis was followed up. Results: On admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction among COVID-19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission were lower among more than seventy-year-old patients than those of younger patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction. Of interest, chest CT score, a key marker of lung injury, was increased among COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. By contrast, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Among 84 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction, 32.1% died. Fatality rate was obviously higher in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction than those with normal lymphocyte (RR=5.789, P<0.001). Conclusion: Older COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction. Lymphocyte reduction at early stage aggravates the severity of multiple organ injuries and elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Fei","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lin Fu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Li","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui-Xian Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Die Li","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Feng Han","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Yong Li","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

Transitions between compartments are modelled either as instantaneous rates in differential equations, or as transition probabilities in discrete time difference or matrix equations. These models give accurate estimates of the position of equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit from it. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics. Here we show how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and thus correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics. We apply this approach to modelling the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic. We show that a SEIR model underestimates peak infection rates (by a factor of three using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan) and substantially overestimates epidemic persistence after the peak has passed.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alastair Grant","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Lin Fu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Li","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui-Xian Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ying Xiang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Die Li","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Feng Han","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Yong Li","author_inst":"Fuyang Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ximena Bonilla","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Department for Computer Science, Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Medical Informatics, Zurich and SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Zurich, "},{"author_name":"Gisel Booman","author_inst":"Regen Network, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew T.

For the example of the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown. Parameters for several countries like UK, USA, Italy, Spain, Germany and China will be estimated and used in W.O. Kermack and A.G. McKendrick's SIR model. Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed. The numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being done with a Runge-Kutta integration method of fourth order. At the end the applicability of the SIR model could be shown. Suggestions about appropriate points in time at which to commence with lockdown measures based on the acceleration rate of infections conclude the paper.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guenter K.F.

Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been critical to support evidence-based policymaking during the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, including the introduction of school closures, social distancing, shielding of elderly groups, self-isolation of symptomatic cases, and extreme \"lockdown\"-type restrictions. We simulated different durations of interventions and triggers for introduction, as well as combinations of interventions. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (intensive care unit, ICU) treatment, and deaths. Findings We found that mitigation measures aimed at reducing transmission would likely have decreased the reproduction number, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability. To keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where \"lockdown\"-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability. Interpretation The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are likely required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"W.

We conduct a mathematical analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations that show this conclusion can change if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such as contact tracing.

A number of explanations have been suggested, but there is no clear evidence about how apparent fatality rates may be expected to vary with the different testing regimes, admission policies and other variables. An individual patient simulation model was developed to address this question. Parameters and sensitivity analysis based upon recent international data sources for Covid-19 and results were averaged over 100 iterations for a simulated cohort of over 500,000 patients. Different testing regimes for Covid-19 were considered; testing admitted patients only, various rates of community testing of symptomatic cases and active contact-tracing and screening. In the base case analysis, apparent mortality ranged from 10.5% under a policy of testing only admitted patients to 0.4% with intensive contact tracing and community testing. These findings were sensitive to assumptions regarding admission rates and the rate of spread, with more selective admission policies and suppression of spread increasing the apparent mortality and the potential for apparent mortality rates to exceed 18% under some circumstances. Under all scenarios the proportion of patients tested in the community had the greatest impact on apparent mortality. Whilst differences in mortality due to health service and demographic factors cannot be excluded, the current international differences in reported mortality are all consistent with differences in practice regarding screening, community testing and admission policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan A Michaels","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Matt D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"W.

Predicting the surge in capacity has proved difficult due to the requirement of a subtle combination of diverse expertise and difficult choices to be made on selecting robust measures of critical care utilization, and parsimonious epidemic modelling which account for changing government measures. We modelled the required surge capacity of ICU beds in Italy exclusively for COVID-19 patients at epidemic peak. Because new measures were imposed by the Italian government, suspending nearly all non-essential sectors of the economy, we included the potential impacts of these new measures. The modelling considered those hospitalized and home isolated as quarantined, mimicking conditions on the ground. The percentage of patients in intensive care (out of the daily active confirmed cases) required for our calculations were chosen based on clinical relevance and robustness, and this number was consistently on average 9.9% from February 24 to March 6, 2020. Five different scenarios were produced (two positive and three negative). Under most positive scenarios, in which R0 is reduced below 1 (i.e., 0.71), the number of daily active confirmed cases will peak at nearly 89 000 by the early days of April and the total number of intensive care beds exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients required in Italy estimated at 8791. Worst scenarios produce unmanageable numbers. Our results suggest that the decisive moment for Italy has come. Jointly reinforcement by the government of the measures approved so far, including home confinement, but even more important the full commitment of the civil society in respecting home confinement, social distancing and hygiene will be key in the next days. Yet, even under the best circumstances, intensive care capacity will need to get closer to 9000 units in the country to avoid preventable mortality. So far, only strong measures were effective in Italy, as shown by our modelling, and this may offer an opportunity to European countries to accelerate their interventions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Manuel Rodriguez Llanes","author_inst":"European Commission Joint Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Rafael Castro Delgado","author_inst":"University of Oviedo"},{"author_name":"Morten Gram Pedersen","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Padova"},{"author_name":"Pedro Arcos Gonzalez","author_inst":"University of Oviedo"},{"author_name":"Matteo Meneghini","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Padova"},{"author_name":"W.

A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 4,794--22,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526--265,113], respectively. The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.34--3.50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65--0.92]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.
