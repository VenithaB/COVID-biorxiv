The early detection of this type of virus will help in relieving the pressure of the healthcare systems. Chest X-rays has been playing a crucial role in the diagnosis of diseases like Pneumonia. As COVID-19 is a type of influenza, it is possible to diagnose using this imaging technique. With rapid development in the area of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning, there had been intelligent systems to classify between Pneumonia and Normal patients. This paper proposes the machine learning-based classification of the extracted deep feature using ResNet152 with COVID-19 and Pneumonia patients on chest X-ray images. SMOTE is used for balancing the imbalanced data points of COVID-19 and Normal patients. This non-invasive and early prediction of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) by analyzing chest X-rays can further be used to predict the spread of the virus in asymptomatic patients. The model is achieving an accuracy of 0.973 on Random Forest and 0.977 using XGBoost predictive classifiers. The establishment of such an approach will be useful to predict the outbreak early, which in turn can aid to control it effectively.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Ridhi Arora","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Vipul Bansal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Vinodh J Sahayasheela","author_inst":"Kyoto University of Advanced Study, Kyoto, Japan"},{"author_name":"Himanshu Buckchash","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Javed Imran","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Narayanan Narayanan","author_inst":"Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ganesh N Pandian","author_inst":"Kyoto University of Advanced Study, Kyoto, Japan"},{"author_name":"Balasubramanian Raman","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063941","rel_title":"Sample-Efficient Deep Learning for COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on CT Scans","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063941","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 1.3 million individuals all over the world and caused more than 106,000 deaths. One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. There have been increasing efforts on developing deep learning methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, these works are difficult to reproduce and adopt since the CT data used in their studies are not publicly available. Besides, these works require a large number of CTs to train accurate diagnosis models, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We build a publicly-available dataset containing hundreds of CT scans positive for COVID-19 and develop sample-efficient deep learning methods that can achieve high diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19 from CT scans even when the number of training CT images are limited. Specifically, we propose an Self-Trans approach, which synergistically integrates contrastive self-supervised learning with transfer learning to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Self-Trans approach compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach achieves an F1 of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans, even though the number of training CTs is just a few hundred.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuehai He","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xingyi Yang","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Shanghang Zhang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Zhao","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Yichen Zhang","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Eric Xing","author_inst":"CMU"},{"author_name":"Pengtao Xie","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ganesh N Pandian","author_inst":"Kyoto University of Advanced Study, Kyoto, Japan"},{"author_name":"Balasubramanian Raman","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063925","rel_title":"REGIONAL DETERMINANTS OF THE EXPANSION OF COVID-19 IN BRAZIL","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063925","rel_abs":"Objective: This study investigates the regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 in Brazil and its relationship with climatic and demographic factors by use data from February 26 to April 04, 2020.

Markers that could predict patients at risk of poor outcomes would be extremely useful clinically. Evidence has emerged that low lymphocyte count is associated with increased disease severity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between lymphocyte count and severity of SARS-CoV-2 associated clinical disease. Results: Seven papers were included in the meta-analysis. These papers included data from 2083 patients, 25% (n=521) with severe SAR-CoV-2 disease and 75% (n=1562) with non-severe SAR-CoV-2 disease. Heterogenicity was seen in the definition of severe disease. Metanalysis produced metamedians of 1x109\/L (95% CI 1-1.1) and 0.7x109\/L (95% CI 0.63-0.8) lymphocytes for patients with non-severe and severe disease respectively (p-value of p=0.006 Wilcoxon test). Calculation of metamedians from the two papers classifying severe disease according to death alone gave 1.1 1x109\/L lymphocytes (95% CI 1.0-1.1) for \"survivors\" (n=163) and 0.63 1x109\/L lymphocytes (95% CI 0.60-0.63) for \"non-survivors\" (n=253) of SAR-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Lower lymphocyte counts are significantly associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Often, the number of \"confirmed cases\", which is based on positive RT-PCR test results, is regarded as a reasonable indicator. However, limited COVID-19 test capacities in many countries are restricting the amount of testing that can be done. This can lead to the implementation of testing policies that restrict access to COVID-19 tests, and to testing backlogs and delays. As a result, confirmed case numbers can be significantly lower than the actual number of infections, especially during rapid growth phases of the epidemic. This study examines the quantitative relation between infections and reported confirmed case numbers for two different testing strategies, \"limited\" and \"inclusive\" testing, in relation to the growth rate of the epidemic. The results indicate that confirmed case numbers understate the actual number of infections substantially; during rapid growth phases where the daily growth rate can reach or exceed 30%, as has been seen in many countries, the confirmed case numbers under-report actual infections by up to 50 to 100-fold.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Richterich","author_inst":"CodonCode Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Amos","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eva Harris-Skillman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bronwen Harbinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beata Dunne","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Drake","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sophie Roche","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Edward Harris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James Gunnel","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Joshu Frost","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20064048","rel_title":"The Prediction for the Outbreak of COVID-19 for 15 States in USA by Using Turning Phase Concepts as of April 10, 2020","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20064048","rel_abs":"Based on a new concept called Turning Period,the goal of this report is to show how we can conduct the prediction for the outlook in the different stages for the battle with outbreak of COVID-19 currently in US, in particular, to identify when each of top 15 states in USA (basically on their populations) is going to enter into the stage that the outbreak of COVID-19 is under the control by the criteria such as daily change of new patients is less than 10% smoothly.

Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. Methods We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in Ile-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. Results We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case-finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. Conclusions As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Di Domenico","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Orange Experience Design Lab"},{"author_name":"Chiara E.

This challenge led to the concept of splitting ventilator between several patients, which aroused interest as well as a strong opposition from multiple professional societies (The joint statement)1.Establishment of a safe ventilator splitting setup which enables monitoring and control of each ventilated patient would be a desirable ability. Achieving independency between the Co-vent patients would enable effective coping with different individual clinical scenarios and broaden the pairing possibilities of patients connected to a single ventilator. We conducted an experiment to determine if our designed setup achieves these goals. Methods: We utilized a double two limbed modified ventilator circuits which were connected to dual lung simulators. Adding readily available pressure sensors (transducers), PEEP valves, flow control valves, one-way (check) valves and HME filters made the circuit safe enough and suitable for our goals. We first examined a single lung simulator establishing the baseline set parameters, while monitoring ventilator measures as Tidal Volume. The initial ventilator setting we chose was a controlled mandatory ventilation mode with a PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) of 25cmH2O, PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) of 5 cmH2O. In pressure control set at 20 cmH2O, the recorded mean TV( tidal volume) was 1000 mL (approximately 500 mL\/lung simulator) with an average MV(minute ventilation) of 13 L\/min (or 6.5 L\/min\/lung simulator). After examining the system with the dual modified circuits attached, and obtaining all the ventilation parameters, we simulated several clinical scenarios. We simulated clinical events such as: partial or full obstruction, disconnection, air leak and compliance differentials, which occur frequently on a ventilation course. Thus, it is a paramount system demand to keep undisturbed ventilation to the Co-vent patient A, while being challenged by patient B. Results: The adaptive split ventilator setup yields increased safety, monitoring, and controls ventilation parameters successfully for each connected simulated patient (using lung simulators).It also enables coping with several common clinical scenarios on a ventilation course, by allowing the care provider to control PIP and PEEP of each Co-Vent patient. Conclusion: In a mass crisis setting, when there is a shortage of ventilators supply, and as a last resort, this setup can be a viable option to act upon. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the split ventilator to ventilate dual lung simulators with increased safety, monitoring and ventilation pressures control of each simulated patient. This split ventilator kept supporting a simulated patient with undisturbed parameters while the CO-vent patient was simulated to be disconnected, having an air leak, or exhibiting lung compliance deterioration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a split ventilator setup demonstrates these capabilities. Our pilot experiment suggests a significant potential of expanding the ventilator support resources, and is especially relevant during COVID-19 outbreak. Since this setup has not been used in a clinical setting yet, further research should be conducted to explore the safety limits and the capabilities of this model.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarit Hadar Shahroor","author_inst":"Hebrew University Hadassah Medical school"},{"author_name":"Yarden Sarouf","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Leav Oz-Ari","author_inst":"Fabric Robotics"},{"author_name":"M Gilad","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064790","rel_title":"How high and long will the COVID-19 wave be?

Most countries have implemented numerous social distancing measures in order to limit its transmission and control the outbreak. This study aims to describe the impact of these control measures on the spread of the disease for Italy and Germany, forecast the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in both countries and estimate the medical capacity requirements in terms of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICUs) for optimal clinical treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients, for the Germany health system. Methods: We used an exponential decline function to model the trajectory of the daily growth rate of infections in Italy and Germany. A linear regression of the logarithmic growth rate functions of different stages allowed to describe the impact of the social distancing measures leading to a faster decline of the growth rate in both countries. We used the linear model to predict the number of diagnosed and fatal COVID-19 cases from April 10th until May 31st. For Germany we estimated the required daily number of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICU) using clinical observations on the average lengths of a hospital stay for the severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Results: Analyzing the data from Germany and Italy allowed us to identify changes in the trajectory of the growth rate of infection most likely resulted from the various social distancing measures implemented. In Italy a stronger decline in the growth rate was observed around the week of March 17th, whereas for Germany the stronger decline occurred approximately a week later (the week of March 23rd). Under the assumption that the impact of the measures will last, the total size of the outbreak can be estimated to 155,000 cases in Germany (range 140,000-180,000) and to 185,000 cases in Italy (range 175,000-200,000). For Germany the total number of deaths until May 31st is calculated to 3,850 (range 3,500-4,450). Based on the projected number of new COVID-19 cases we expect that the hospital capacity requirements for severe and critical cases in Germany will decline from the 2nd week of April onwards from 13,500 to ~2500 hospital beds (range 1500-4300) and from 2500 to ~500 ICU beds in early May (range 300-800). Conclusion: The modeling effort presented here provides a valuable framework to capture the impact of the social distancing measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in European countries and to forecast the future trend of daily COVID-19 cases. It provides a tool for medical authorities in Germany and other countries to help inform the required hospital capacity of the health care system. Germany appears to be in the middle of the (first) COVID-19 outbreak wave and the German health system is well prepared to handle it with the available capacities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Klabunde","author_inst":"Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH"},{"author_name":"Clemens Giegerich","author_inst":"Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH"},{"author_name":"Leav Oz-Ari","author_inst":"Fabric Robotics"},{"author_name":"M Gilad","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061481","rel_title":"AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL TO AID DECISION-MAKING FOR COVID-19 CONTROL IN SRI LANKA","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061481","rel_abs":"Background: Sri Lanka diagnosed its first local case of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020. The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of the health system. Methods: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after lockout. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population exposed; proportion asymptomatic; number of active and recovered cases; infectious period; R0 or doubling time; proportion critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. Results: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0=3.32, 95% CI 1.85 - 5.41) and from Day 18 - 30 (R=1.25, 95%CI: 0.93 - 1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lockout, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days days, signalled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15 - 22) on Day 14 after lockout. Conclusion: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lockout, transmission should not exceed R=1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dileepa S Ediriweera","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Nilanthi R de Silva","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Neelika G Malavige","author_inst":"Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"H Janaka de Silva","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20063008","rel_title":"Prediction of the time evolution of the COVID-19 disease in Guadeloupe with a stochastic evolutionary model","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20063008","rel_abs":"Predictions on the time-evolution of the number of severe and critical cases of COVID-19 patients in Guadeloupe are presented. A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population ({approx} 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID-19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time-evolution of the number of cases follows the well-known exponential-like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so-called basic reproductive number, R0, defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period TI . Because of the rather long duration of infectious period (about 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R0 provided we have R0 < 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital ' s intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R0 < 0.6. For a larger R0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing-down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success. Appendix Posterior model assessment with data acquired after April 11, 2020 added in a second version of the paper compares the model predictions with the data acquired from April 12 to May 25 2020, after the construction of the model discussed in the present study. The remarkable agreement between the model predictions and the data may be explained by the good quality of first-hand data used to constrain the model, the ability of the stochastic approach to integrate new information and stability of the sanitary situation due to the respect of the recommendations emitted by medical and administrative authorities by the guadeloupean population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MERIEM ALLALI","author_inst":"CHU POINTE A PITRE, URGENCES SAMU SMUR"},{"author_name":"PATRICK PORTECOP","author_inst":"CHU POINTE A PITRE, HEAD OF SAMU SMUR UNIT"},{"author_name":"MICHEL CARLES","author_inst":"CHU POINTE A PITRE, HEAD OF CRITICAL CARE DEPARTMENT"},{"author_name":"DOMINIQUE GIBERT","author_inst":"LYON 1 UNIVERSITY OBSERVATORY"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061721","rel_title":"COVID-19-related mortality by age groups in Europe: A meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061721","rel_abs":"Background and Objectives: To date, more than 1,000,000 confirmed cases and 65,000 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported globally. Early data have indicated that older patients are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than younger ones, but precise international estimates of the age-breakdown of COVID-19-related deaths are lacking. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the distribution of COVID-19-related fatalities by age groups in Europe. On April 6, 2020, we systematically reviewed COVID-19-related mortality data from 32 European countries (European Union\/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom). We collated official reports provided by local Public Health or Ministry of Health websites. We included countries if they provided data regarding more than 10 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by age according to pre-specified groups (i.e., < 40, 40-69, [&ge;] 70 years). We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of age groups among all COVID-19-related fatalities. Results: Thirteen European countries were included in the review, for a total of 31,864 COVID-19-related deaths (range: 27-14,381 per country). In the main meta-analysis (including data from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland; 21,522 COVID-19-related fatalities), the summary proportions of persons < 40, 40-69, and [&ge;] 70 years of age among all COVID-19-related deaths were 0.1% (0.0-0.2%; I2 24%), 12.8% (10.3-15.6%; I2 94%), and 84.8% (81.3-88.1%; I2 96%), respectively. Conclusions: People under 40 years of age represent a small fraction of the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Europe. These results may help health authorities respond to public concerns and guide future physical distancing and mitigation strategies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie F.

Meanwhile there were controversies among different studies about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients. Hence, we aimed to study CVD burden among COVID-19 patients, using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in journal websites and Google Scholar. Meta-analyses were carried out for Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for different CVDs. We have also performed a descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs. Results: Fifty-six studies entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and 198 papers for descriptive outcomes, including 159,698 COVID-19 patients. Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 13.29, 95% CI 7.35-24.03), hypertension (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 2.11-3.19), heart Failure (OR: 6.72, 95% CI 3.34-13.52), arrhythmia (OR: 2.75, 95% CI 1.43-5.25), coronary artery disease (OR: 3.78, 95% CI 2.42-5.90), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.89-3.62) were significantly associated with mortality. Arrhythmia (OR: 7.03, 95% CI 2.79-17.69), acute cardiac injury (OR: 15.58, 95% CI 5.15-47.12), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.09-6.26), cardiovascular disease (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.59-6.09), and hypertension (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.41-2.68) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Findings of this study revealed a high burden of CVDs among COVID-19 patients, which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission. Proper management of CVD patients with COVID-19 and monitoring COVID-19 patients for acute cardiac conditions is highly recommended to prevent mortality and critical situations.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amir Shamshirian","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Keyvan Heydari","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Pourali","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Moosazadeh","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saeed Abrotan","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Layla Shojaei","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Sogol Sedighi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nima Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061994","rel_title":"Identifying common pharmacotherapies associated with reduced COVID-19 morbidity using electronic health records","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061994","rel_abs":"Objective: Absent a vaccine or any established treatments for the novel and highly infectious coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), rapid efforts to identify potential therapeutics are required.

Design: In silico cohort using electronic health records from individuals evaluated in the emergency department between March 4, 2020 and July 12, 2020. Setting: Emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals presenting to an emergency department and undergoing COVID-19 testing. Main Outcome or Measure: Inpatient hospitalization; documented requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 7,360 individuals with COVID-19 positive test results by PCR, 3,693 (50.2%) were hospitalized in one of 6 hospitals. In models adjusted for sociodemographic features and overall burden of medical illness, medications significantly associated with diminished risk for hospitalization included ibuprofen and sumatriptan. Among individuals who were hospitalized, 962(26.0%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 608 (16.5%) died; ibuprofen and naproxen were also more commonly prescribed among individuals not requiring intensive care.

Although precise transmission routes and dynamics are unknown, SARS-CoV2 is thought primarily to spread via contagious respiratory droplets. Unlike with SARS-CoV, maximal viral shedding occurs in the early phase of illness, and this is supported by models that suggest 40-80% of transmission events occur from pre- and asymptomatic individuals. One widely-discussed strategy to limit transmission of SARS-CoV2, particularly from presymptomatic individuals, has been population-level wearing of masks. Modelling for pandemic influenza suggests some benefit in reducing total numbers infected with even 50% mask-use. COVID-19 has a higher hospitalization and mortality rate than influenza, and the impacts on these parameters, and critically, at what point in the pandemic trajectory mask-use might exert maximal benefit are completely unknown. We derived a simplified SIR model to investigate the effects of near-universal mask-use on COVID-19 assuming 8 or 16% mask efficacy. We decided to model, in particular, the impact of masks on numbers of critically-ill patients and cumulative mortality, since these are parameters that are likely to have the most severe consequences in the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas mask use had a relatively minor benefit on critical-care and mortality rates when transmissibility (Reff) was high, the reduction on deaths was dramatic as the effective R approached 1, as might be expected after aggressive social-distancing measures such as wide-spread lockdowns. One major concern with COVID-19 is its potential to overwhelm healthcare infrastructures, even in resource-rich settings, with one third of hospitalized patients requiring critical-care. We incorporated this into our model, increasing death rates for when critical-care resources have been exhausted. Our simple model shows that modest efficacy of masks could avert substantial mortality in this scenario. Importantly, the effects on mortality became hyper-sensitive to mask-wearing as the effective R approaches 1, i.e. near the tipping point of when the infection trajectory is expected to revert to exponential growth, as would be expected after effective lockdown. Our model suggests that mask-wearing might exert maximal benefit as nations plan their post-lockdown strategies and suggests that mask-wearing should be included in further more sophisticated models of the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Babak Javid","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Q Balaban","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Debora Formisano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Venturelli","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Vicentini","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Grilli","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"- The Reggio Emilia COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Layla Shojaei","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Sogol Sedighi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nima Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20061002","rel_title":"Estimating the Final Epidemic Size for COVID-19 Outbreak using Improved Epidemiological Models","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20061002","rel_abs":"Final epidemic sizes of different geographical regions due to COVID-19 are estimated using logistic, SIR and generalized SEIR models.

In this paper, we described the epidemiological characteristics of the laboratory-confirmed patients with Covid-2019 in the Philippines as of April 3, 2020 and provided recommendations on how to limit the spread of the disease. Data from the DOH NCOV tracker and University of the Philippines Covid-2019 tracker were extracted, from its initiation (January 30, 2020) until the most recent situation report (April 3, 2020). The total number of cases and deaths were stratified by sex, age, and region of the Philippines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic profile of the confirmed cases. Case fatality rate, in percent, was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases. Results revealed that a total of 3,018 cases of Covid-2019 spread were confirmed across 17 regions in the Philippines. These cases occurred over the course of 73 days through person-to-person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate. The 144 deaths accounted for, equate to 4.51 case fatality rate, seemingly lower compared to its predecessors, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but higher compared to that of United States of America, Germany, mainland China, and neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand. Of the 3,018 confirmed cases, majority were male, elderly, and diagnosed in Metro Manila region. Case fatality rates were higher in male and highest among elderly and Filipinos in the Ilocos region. With the surge on the number of cases, precautionary measures should remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set. Adherence to infection control guidelines such as but not limited to frequently handwashing for at least 20 seconds, observing coughing etiquette, wearing of masks, and social distancing should be maintained in order to contain the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Marcos Alipio","author_inst":"Davao Doctors College"},{"author_name":"Joseph Dave Mendoza Pregoner","author_inst":"University of the Immaculate Conception"},{"author_name":"Debora Formisano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Venturelli","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Vicentini","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Grilli","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"- The Reggio Emilia COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Layla Shojaei","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Sogol Sedighi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nima Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20048025","rel_title":"Further analysis of the impact of distancing upon the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20048025","rel_abs":"This paper questions various claims from the paper \"Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic\" by Kissler, Tedijanto, Lipsitch, and Grad: most importantly, the claim that China's \"intense\" distancing measures achieved only a 60% reduction in R0.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel J.

However, little is known about the epidemiology and burden of severe COVID-19 to inform planning within healthcare systems and modeling of intervention impact. Methods: We assessed incidence, duration of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes of acute COVID-19 inpatient admissions in a prospectively-followed cohort of 9,596,321 individuals enrolled in comprehensive, integrated healthcare delivery plans from Kaiser Permanente in California and Washington state. We also estimated the effective reproductive number (RE) describing transmission in the study populations. Results: Data covered 1277 hospitalized patients with laboratory- or clinically-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by April 9, 2020. Cumulative incidence of first COVID-19 acute inpatient admission was 10.6-12.4 per 100,000 cohort members across the study regions. Mean censoring-adjusted duration of hospitalization was 10.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 0.8-30.1) among survivors and 13.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 1.7-34.6) among non-survivors. Among all hospitalized confirmed cases, censoring-adjusted probabilities of ICU admission and mortality were 41.9% (95% confidence interval: 34.1-51.4%) and 17.8% (14.3-22.2%), respectively, and higher among men than women. We estimated RE was 1.43 (1.17-1.73), 2.09 (1.63-2.69), and 1.47 (0.07-2.59) in Northern California, Southern California, and Washington, respectively, for infections acquired March 1, 2020. RE declined to 0.98 (0.76-1.27), 0.89 (0.74-1.06), and 0.92 (0.05-1.55) respectively, for infections acquired March 20, 2020. Conclusions: We identify high probability of ICU admission, long durations of stay, and considerable mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in the western United States. Reductions in RE have occurred in conjunction with implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph A Lewnard","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Vincent X Liu","author_inst":"Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Health Research Institute, Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark A Schmidt","author_inst":"Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest"},{"author_name":"Britta L Jewell","author_inst":"Imperial College, London"},{"author_name":"Jean P Flores","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Chris Jentz","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Graham R Northrup","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Mahmud","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Arthur L Reingold","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Maya Petersen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Jewell","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Scott Young","author_inst":"The Permanente Foundation, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Jim Bellows","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063669","rel_title":"Smoking is Associated with COVID-19 Progression: A Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063669","rel_abs":"Objective: To determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19. Design: A meta-analysis of 12 published papers. Data Source: PubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included smoking, smoker*, characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, and COVID-19, COVID, coronavirus, sar cov-2, sar cov 2. There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied. Main Outcome Measures: The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. Results: We identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher. Conclusions: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roengrudee Patanavanich","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Stanton A Glantz","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Health Research Institute, Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark A Schmidt","author_inst":"Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest"},{"author_name":"Britta L Jewell","author_inst":"Imperial College, London"},{"author_name":"Jean P Flores","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Chris Jentz","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Graham R Northrup","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Mahmud","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Arthur L Reingold","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Maya Petersen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Jewell","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Scott Young","author_inst":"The Permanente Foundation, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Jim Bellows","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062026","rel_title":"Vapor H2O2 sterilization as a decontamination method for the reuse of N95 respirators in the COVID-19 emergency","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20062026","rel_abs":"There are a variety of methods routinely used in the sterilization of medical devices using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) including vaporization, plasma generation and ionization.
