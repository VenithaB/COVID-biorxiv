Different features associated with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, such as hyperinflammation and reduction of peripheral CD8+ T cell counts are strongly associated with severe disease. Here, we confirm the reduction in peripheral CD8+ T cells both in relative and absolute terms and identify T cell apoptosis and migration into inflamed tissues as possible mechanisms driving peripheral T cell lymphopenia. Furthermore, we find evidence of elevated serum interleukin-7, thus indicating systemic T cell paucity and signs of increased T cell proliferation in patients with severe lymphopenia. Following T cell lymphopenia in our pseudo-longitudinal time course, we observed expansion and recovery of poly-specific antiviral T cells, thus arguing for lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation. In summary, this study suggests that extensive T cell loss and subsequent T cell proliferation are characteristic of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Adamo","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Chevrier","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Carlo Cervia","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Yves Zurbuchen","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Miro E.

Excessive inflammation has been postulated to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and innate immune mechanisms are likely to be central in the inflammatory response. We used 40-plex mass cytometry and targeted serum proteomics to profile innate immune cell populations from peripheral blood of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and healthy controls. Sampling at different stages of COVID-19 allowed us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate immune response. Despite the expected patient heterogeneity, we identified consistent changes during the course of the infection. A rapid and early surge of CD169+ monocytes associated with an IFN{gamma}+MCP-2+ signature quickly followed symptom onset; at symptom onset, patients with mild and severe COVID-19 had a similar signature, but over the course of the disease, the differences between patients with mild and severe disease increased. Later in the disease course, we observed a more pronounced re-appearance of intermediate\/non-classical monocytes and mounting systemic CCL3 and CCL4 levels in patients with severe disease. Our data provide new insights into the dynamic nature of the early inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and identifies sustained pathological innate immune responses as a likely key mechanism in severe COVID-19, further supporting investigation of targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Chevrier","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Yves Zurbuchen","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Carlo Cervia","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Adamo","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Miro E Raeber","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Natalie de Souza","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sujana Sivapatham","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andrea Jacobs","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Esther B\u00e4chli","author_inst":"Clinic for Internal Medicine, Uster Hospital, Uster, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alain Rudiger","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Limmattal Hospital, Schlieren, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Melina St\u00fcssi-Helbling","author_inst":"Clinic for Internal Medicine, City Hospital Triemli Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lars C Huber","author_inst":"Clinic for Internal Medicine, City Hospital Triemli Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dominik J Schaer","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, USZ, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jakob Nilsson","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Onur Boyman","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bernd Bodenmiller","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.235747","rel_title":"A valid protective immune response elicited in rhesus macaques by an inactivated vaccine is capable of defending against SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.235747","rel_abs":"With the relatively serious global epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, public concerns focus on not only clinical therapeutic measures and public quarantine for this disease but also the development of vaccines. The technical design of our SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine provides a viral antigen that enables the exposure of more than one structural protein based upon the antibody composition of COVID-19 patients convalescent serum. This design led to valid immunity with increasing neutralizing antibody titers and a CTL response detected post-immunization of this vaccine by two injections in rhesus macaques. Further, this elicited immunoprotection in macaques enables not only to restrain completely viral replication in tissues of immunized animals, compared to the adjuvant control and those immunized by an RBD peptide vaccine, but also to significantly alleviate inflammatory lesion in lung tissues in histo-pathologic detection, compared to the adjuvant control with developed interstitial pneumonia. The data obtained from these macaques immunized with the inactivated vaccine or RBD peptide vaccine suggest that immunity with a clinically protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection should include not only specific neutralizing antibodies but also specific CTL responses against at least the S and N antigens.","rel_num_authors":54,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongbo

pathogenesis in SARS-CoV2 is the ORF3a protein which is the largest accessory protein among others accessory proteins coded by coronavirus genome. The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 is continuously evolving naturally and thereby the encoded proteins are also mutating rapidly. Therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainty important from the pathogenetic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 various non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV2 are identified and their corresponding effects in structural stability and functions of the protein ORF3a are studied. Broadly three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease and mixed (neutral and disease) type mutations were observed. Consecutive mutations in some ORF3a proteins are established based on timeline of detection of mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions over the ORF3a primary protein sequences, twenty clusters are detected based on K-means clustering method. Our findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge of ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV2, which would assist to enlighten on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sk.

a fast-moving epidemic, timely monitoring of case counts and other key indicators of disease spread is critical to an effective public policy response. We describe a nonparametric statistical method - originally applied to the reporting of AIDS cases in the 1980s - to estimate the distribution of reporting delays of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City. During June 21 - August 1, 2020, the estimated mean delay in reporting was 5 days, with 15 percent of cases reported after 10 or more days. Relying upon the estimated reporting-delay distribution, we project COVID-19 incidence during the most recent three weeks as if each case had instead been reported on the same day that the underlying diagnostic test had been performed. The statistical method described here overcomes the problem of reporting delays only at the population level. The method does not eliminate reporting delays at the individual level. That will require improvements in diagnostic technology, test availability, and specimen processing.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey E Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Diksha Attrish","author_inst":"Dr. B.

available rapid immunological tests for identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies and their subsequent application to a regional screening of health care workers (HCW) in Tuscany (Italy). Design: measures of accuracy and HCW serological surveillance Setting: 6 major health facilities in Tuscany, Italy. Participants: 17,098 HCW of the Tuscany Region. Measures of accuracy were estimated to assess sensitivity in 176 hospitalized Covid-19 clinical subjects at least 14 days after a diagnostic PCR-positive assay result. Specificity was assessed in 295 sera biobanked in the pre-Covid-19 era in winter or summer 2013-14 Main outcome measures: Sensitivity and specificity, and 95% confidence intervals, were measured using two serological tests, named T-1 and T-2. Positive and Negative predictive values were estimated at different levels of prevalence. HCW of the health centers were tested using the serological tests, with a follow- up nasopharyngeal PCR-test swab in positive tested cases. Results: Sensitivity was estimated as 99% (95%CI: 95%-100%) and 97% (95% CI: 90%-100%), whereas specificity was the 95% and 92%, for Test T-1 and T-2 respectively. In the historical samples IgM cross-reactions were detected in sera collected during the winter period, probably linked to other human coronaviruses. Out of the 17,098 tested, 3.1% have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, among them 6.8% were positive at PCR follow-up test on nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusion Based on the low prevalence estimate observed in this survey, the use of serological test as a stand-alone test is not justified to assess the individual immunity status. Serological tests showed good performance and might be useful in an integrated surveillance, for identification of infected subjects and their contacts as required by the policy of contact tracing, with the aim to reduce the risk of dissemination, especially in health service facilities.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Maria Carozzi","author_inst":"Regional Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, Institute for prevention, research and oncological network (ISPRO)"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Cusi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena"},{"author_name":"Mauro Pistello","author_inst":"Virology Unit, Pisa University Hospital, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisa Galli","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy  and Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Meyer Children's University, Hospital, Florence,"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bartoloni","author_inst":"Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy  and Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Anichini","author_inst":"Department of Translational Research, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Azzari","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy and Pediatric Immunology Unit, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Emdin","author_inst":"Fondazione Toscana G.

A safe and effective vaccine that can provide herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to stop the spread of this virus among humans. Many human viral vaccines are live attenuated forms of viruses that elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the development of a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine (SARS-CoV-2\/human\/Korea\/CNUHV03-CA22{degrees}C\/2020) by gradually adapting the growth of SARS-CoV-2 from 37{degrees}C to 22{degrees}C in Vero cells. This vaccine can be potentially administered to humans through nasal spray. Its single dose was observed to strongly induce the neutralising antibody (>640), cellular immunity, and mucosal IgA antibody in intranasally immunised K18-hACE2 mice, which are very susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. The one-dose vaccinated mice were completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not show loss of body weight, death, and the presence of virus in tissues, such as the nasal turbinates, brain, lungs, and kidneys. Taken together, the cold-adapted live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developed by us may contribute to saving of human lives from the threat of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sang Heui Seo","author_inst":"Chungnam National University"},{"author_name":"Yunyueng Jang","author_inst":"Chungnam National University"},{"author_name":"Asghar Nasir","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Waqasuddin Khan","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Syed H Abidi","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Saba Shahid","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Syed F Mahmood","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Akbar R Kanji","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Safina A Razzak","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Zeeshan Ansar","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Nazneen Islam","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad B Dharejo","author_inst":"Govt. of Sindh"},{"author_name":"Zahra Hasan","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Rumina Hasan","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Claudio Passino","author_inst":"Fondazione Toscana G.

Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost, compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around sequencing accuracy. To address this, we performed viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of analytical performance. Despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at >99% sensitivity and >98% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count frequencies. This systematic evaluation of analytical performance for SARS-CoV-2 WGS will facilitate widespread adoption of ONT sequencing within local, national and international COVID-19 public health initiatives.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rowena A Bull","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Thiruni Adikari","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Jillian M Hammond","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Igor Stevanovski","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"James M Ferguson","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Alicia G Beukers","author_inst":"NSW Health Pathology, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,"},{"author_name":"Zin Naing","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Malinna Yeang","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Andrey Verich","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Hasindu Gamaarachichi","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Ki Wook Kim","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Fabio Luciani Sr.","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Sacha Stelzer-Braid","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"John-Sebastian Eden","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity & Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"William D Rawlinson","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Sebastiaan J van Hal","author_inst":"NSW Health Pathology, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,"},{"author_name":"Ira W Deveson","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Marco Zappa","author_inst":"Unit of Clinical and Descriptive Epidemiology, Institute for prevention, research and oncological network (ISPRO), Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Quattrone","author_inst":"Fondazione Toscana G.

We performed experiments to test if hypertonic saline solution is able to inhibit virus replication in vitro. Our data shows that 260 mM NaCl (1.5%) inhibits 100% SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that the virus replication inhibition is due to an intracellular mechanism and not due to the dissociation between spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. NaCl depolarizes the plasma membrane supposedly associated with the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. This observation could lead to simple, safe and low cost interventions at various stages of COVID-19 treatment, improving the prognosis of infected patients, thereby mitigating the social and economic costs of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Rahal Guaragna Machado","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Talita Glaser","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Danielle Bastos Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lyvia Lintzmaier Petiz","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Danielle Bruna Leal Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Stravinskas Durigon","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Lima Leal","author_inst":"Gaspar Vianna Clinic Hospital Foundation"},{"author_name":"Joao Renato R.

Independent of it, another reproduction number is introduced, which is defined similarly to the usual net reproduction number. Due to its simple analytic form, it enables a clear interpretation for all values. A further parameter, provisionally called acceleration parameter, is introduced and applied, which enables a more differentiated characterization of the infection number dynamics. By a variable transformation the 3 equations of the modified SIR-model can be reduced to 2. The latter are solved up to ordinary integrations. The solutions are evaluated for current situations, yielding a pretty good match with the data reported. Encouraged by this, a variety of possible future developments is examined, including linear and exponential growth of the infection numbers as well as sub- and super-exponential growth. In particular, the behavior of the two reproduction numbers and the acceleration parameter is studied, which in some cases leads to surprising results. With regard to the number of unreported infections it is shown, that from the solution for a special one solutions for others can be derived by similarity transformations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eckhard Rebhan","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine Universitaet Duesseldorf"},{"author_name":"Talita Glaser","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Danielle Bastos Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lyvia Lintzmaier Petiz","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Danielle Bruna Leal Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Stravinskas Durigon","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Lima Leal","author_inst":"Gaspar Vianna Clinic Hospital Foundation"},{"author_name":"Joao Renato R.

The nsp13 of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV exhibit the most conserved CoV replicases. Using single-molecule FRET, we observed that MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound DNA in discrete steps of approximately 9 bp when ATP was used. If another NTP was used, then the steps were only 4 to 5 bp. In dwell time analysis, we detected 3 or 4 hidden steps in each unwinding process, which indicated the hydrolysis of 3 or 4 dTTP. Based on crystallographic and biochemical studies of CoV nsp13 helicases, we modeled an unwinding mechanism similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, although our model proposes that flexible 1B and stalk domains, by allowing a lag greater than 4 bp during unwinding, cause the accumulated tension on the nsp13-DNA complex. The hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible than in MERS-CoV nsp13 due to the difference of a single amino acid, which causes the former to induce significantly greater NTP hydrolysis. Our findings thus establish a blueprint for determining the unwinding mechanism of a unique helicase family.\n\nO_LIWhen dTTP was used as the energy source, 4 hidden steps in each individual unwinding step after 3 - 4 NTP hydrolysis were observed.\nC_LIO_LIAn unwinding model of MERS-CoV-nsp13 which is similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, except the accumulation of tension on nsp13\/DNA complex is caused by the flexible 1B and stalk domains that allow a lag of 4-bp in unwinding.\nC_LIO_LIComparing to MERS-CoV nsp13, the hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible due to a single amino acid difference, which contributes to the significantly higher NTP hydrolysis by SARS-CoV-2 nsp13.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Hu","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wei Hao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bo Qin","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhiqi Tian","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ziheng Li","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Pengjiao Hou","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sheng Cui","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiajie Diao","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henning Ulrich","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Edison Luiz Rodrigues Durigon","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Rodrigues Guzzo","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sacha Stelzer-Braid","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"John-Sebastian Eden","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity & Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"William D Rawlinson","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Sebastiaan J van Hal","author_inst":"NSW Health Pathology, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,"},{"author_name":"Ira W Deveson","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Marco Zappa","author_inst":"Unit of Clinical and Descriptive Epidemiology, Institute for prevention, research and oncological network (ISPRO), Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Quattrone","author_inst":"Fondazione Toscana G.

Natural Killer (NK) cells and innate-immune TRAIL suppress transformed and virally-infected cells. ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protease promote SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, while inflammatory cytokines IL-6, or G-CSF worsen COVID-19 severity. We show MEK inhibitors (MEKi) VS-6766, trametinib and selumetinib reduce ACE2 expression in human cells. In some human cells, remdesivir increases ACE2-promoter luciferase-reporter expression, ACE2 mRNA and protein, and ACE2 expression is attenuated by MEKi. In serum-deprived and stimulated cells treated with remdesivir and MEKi we observed correlations between pRB, pERK, and ACE2 expression further supporting role of proliferative state and MAPK pathway in ACE2 regulation. We show elevated cytokines in COVID-19-(+) patient plasma (N=9) versus control (N=11). TMPRSS2, inflammatory cytokines G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1, IL-6 and MCP-1 are suppressed by MEKi alone or with remdesivir. We observed MEKi stimulation of NK-cell killing of target-cells, without suppressing TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus with a lentiviral core and SARS-CoV-2 D614 or G614 SPIKE (S) protein on its envelope infected human bronchial epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, or lung cancer cells and MEKi suppressed infectivity of the pseudovirus. We show a drug class-effect with MEKi to stimulate NK cells, inhibit inflammatory cytokines and block host-factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection leading also to suppression of SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus infection of human cells. MEKi may attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection to allow immune responses and antiviral agents to control disease progression.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lanlan Zhou","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Huntington","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Shengliang Zhang","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Carlsen","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Eui-Young So","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Cassandra Parker","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Ilyas Sahin","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Howard Safran","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Suchitra Kamle","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Min Lee","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Geun Lee","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Jack A.

High-throughput screening on this platform demonstrates rapid identification and triage of hits for TGF-{beta}- and TNF--driven phenotypes. We deploy the platform to develop phenotypic models of active SARS-CoV-2 infection and of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm, surfacing compounds with demonstrated clinical benefit and identifying several new candidates for drug repurposing.

Nup98","rel_date":"2020-08-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.234559","rel_abs":"RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be the major inhibitor of interferon production in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with the host mRNA export factors Rae1 and Nup98. Here, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 strongly represses protein expression of co-transfected reporter constructs and imprisons host mRNA in the nucleus, which is associated with its ability to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C-terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. We further identify an ORF6 mutant containing a 9-amino acid deletion, ORF6 {Delta}22-30, in multiple SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates that can still downregulate the expression of a co-transfected reporter and interact with Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and pre-symptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. One of SARS-CoV-2s accessory proteins, ORF6, was recently shown to co-purify with two host proteins, Rae1 and Nup98, involved in mRNA nuclear export. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interaction with these proteins is associated with reduced expression of a reporter protein and accumulation of poly-A mRNA within the nucleus. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 to more strongly disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport than SARS-CoV ORF6 may partially explain critical differences in clinical presentation between the two viruses.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Addetia","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nicole A.P.

COVA1-16 is a relatively rare antibody that also cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV. Here we determined a crystal structure of COVA1-16 Fab with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and a negative-stain EM reconstruction with the spike glycoprotein trimer, to elucidate the structural basis of its cross-reactivity. COVA1-16 binds a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, mainly through a long CDR H3, and competes with ACE2 binding due to steric hindrance rather than epitope overlap. COVA1-16 binds to a flexible up conformation of the RBD on the spike and relies on antibody avidity for neutralization. These findings, along with structural and functional rationale for the epitope conservation, provide a blueprint for development of more universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines and therapies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hejun Liu","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C.

Heterodimer structures are determined with the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or the SAH analog sinefungin (SFG). Furthermore, structures of nsp16\/nsp10 with the methylated Cap-0 analog (m7GpppA) and SAM or SAH bound were obtained. Comparative analysis revealed flexible loops in open and closed conformations at the m7GpppA binding pocket. Bound sulfates in several structures suggested the location of the phosphates in the ribonucleotide binding groove. Additional nucleotide binding sites were found on the face of the protein opposite the active site. These various sites and the conserved dimer interface could be exploited for development of antiviral inhibitors.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monica Rosas-Lemus","author_inst":"Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Minasov","author_inst":"Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ludmilla Shuvalova","author_inst":"Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicole Inniss","author_inst":"Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Olga Kiryukhina","author_inst":"Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph Brunzelle","author_inst":"Northwestern Synchrotron Research Center, Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team"},{"author_name":"Karla J Satchell","author_inst":"Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xueyong Zhu","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Chang-Chun D.

We have developed a generalized computational design strategy to rapidly engineer de novo proteins that precisely recapitulate the protein surface targeted by biological agents, like viruses, to gain entry into cells. The designed proteins act as decoys that block cellular entry and aim to be resilient to viral mutational escape. Using our novel platform, in less than ten weeks, we engineered, validated, and optimized de novo protein decoys of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the membrane-associated protein that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to infect cells. Our optimized designs are hyperstable de novo proteins ([~]18-37 kDa), have high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and can potently inhibit the virus infection and replication in vitro. Future refinements to our strategy can enable the rapid development of other therapeutic de novo protein decoys, not limited to neutralizing viruses, but to combat any agent that explicitly interacts with cell surface proteins to cause disease.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas William Linsky","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Renan Vergara","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Nuria Codina","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jorgen W Nelson","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Walker","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Wen Su","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tien-Ying Hsiang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Katharina Esser-Nobis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kevin Yu","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yixuan J Hou","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Tanu Priya","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Masaya Mitsumoto","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Avery Pong","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Uland Y Lau","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Marsha L Mason","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jerry Chen","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Alex Chen","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tania Berrocal","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Hong Peng","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Nicole S Clairmont","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Javier Castellanos","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ru Lin","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Anna Josephson-Day","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

The samples were collected across 10 states covering different zones within India. Given the importance of this information for public health response initiatives investigating transmission of COVID-19, the sequence data is being released in GISAID database. This information will improve our understanding on how the virus is spreading, ultimately helping to interrupt the transmission chains, prevent new cases of infection, and provide impetus to research on intervention measures. This will also provide us with information on evolution of the virus, genetic predisposition (if any) and adaptation to human hosts.\n\nOne thousand and fifty two sequences were used for phylodynamic, temporal and geographic mutation patterns and haplotype network analyses. Initial results indicate that multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in India, probably introduced by travel from Europe, USA and East Asia. A2a (20A\/B\/C) was found to be predominant, along with few parental haplotypes 19A\/B. In particular, there is a predominance of the D614G mutation, which is found to be emerging in almost all regions of the country. Additionally, mutations in important regions of the viral genome with significant geographical clustering have also been observed. The temporal haplotype diversities landscape in each region appears to be similar pan India, with haplotype diversities peaking between March-May, while by June A2a (20A\/B\/C) emerged as the predominant one. Within haplotypes, different states appear to have different proportions. Temporal and geographic patterns in the sequences obtained reveal interesting clustering of mutations. Some mutations are present at particularly high frequencies in one state as compared to others. The negative estimate Tajimas D (D = -2.26817) is consistent with the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 population in India. Detailed mutational analysis across India to understand the gradual emergence of mutants at different regions of the country and its possible implication will help in better disease management.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arindam Maitra","author_inst":"National INstitute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Sunil Raghav","author_inst":"Institute of Life Science"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Farhan Ali","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Molin Paynter","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dhiraj Paul","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Nidhan K Biswas","author_inst":"National institute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Arup Ghosh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Science"},{"author_name":"Kunal Jani","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Sreedhar Chinnaswamy","author_inst":"National institute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"ICMR-Regional Centre for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Arvind Sahu","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar Bhat","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Satyajit Mayor","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Apurva Sarin","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"Institute For Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)"},{"author_name":"AJAY PARIDA","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Saumitra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

Scaffolds were built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the RBD, or de novo designed scaffolds were docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes. In both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target binding, folding and stability. Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to 10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC50 values ranging from 35 pM to 35 nM; the most potent of these -- 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made using the second approach -- are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC50 ~ 0.23 ng\/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer in complex with the two most potent minibinders show that the structures of the designs and their binding interactions with the RBD are nearly identical to the computational models, and that all three RBDs in a single Spike protein can be engaged simultaneously. These hyperstable minibinders provide promising starting points for new SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, and illustrate the power of computational protein design for rapidly generating potential therapeutic candidates against pandemic threats.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Baker","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Longxing Cao","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Inna Goreshnik","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brian Coventry","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lauren Miller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lisa Kozodoy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella - another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2 - likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dmitry  A.

A combined approach using statistically-weighted data to fit the start of the epidemic to the mortality record. Parameter estimates were then derived for the transmission rate and basic reproduction number. Age standardised mortality rates are highest in Northampton (urban) and lowest in semi-rural districts. Northamptonshire has a statistically higher Covid-19 mortality rate than for the East Midlands and England as a whole. Model outputs suggest the number of infected individuals exceed official estimates, meaning less than 40 percent of the population may require immunisation. Combining published (sub-regional) mortality rate data with deterministic models on disease spread has the potential to help public health practitioners develop bespoke mitigations, guided by local population demographics.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Petford","author_inst":"University of Northampton"},{"author_name":"Jackie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Northampton"},{"author_name":"Samuel Haynes","author_inst":"The Institute for Cell Biology, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Camille Anna Simonet","author_inst":"The Institute of Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mark EJ Woolhouse","author_inst":"The Usher Institute, College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Helen K Brown","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Lisa Kozodoy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rita E.

Method We analysed mental health data collected during COVID-19 from adults aged 50 and over alongside comparable annual data collected between 2015 and 2019 from the same sample. Trajectories of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) were analysed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels and a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Results 3,281 people completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire, all had at least one data point prior to 2020. In 2020, the adjusted PHQ-9 score for loneliness was 3.2. (95% CI: 3.0-3.4), an increase of one point on previous years and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3). PHQ-9 was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of 0.5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.6-1.8), similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the differences were smaller and the absolute burden of symptoms lower. Conclusions After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byron Creese","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Zunera Khan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"William Henley","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Anne Corbett","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vasconcelos Da Silva","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Mills","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Natalie Wright","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ingelin Testad","author_inst":"Stavanger University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dag Aarsland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Clive Ballard","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lance Stewart","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Satyajit Mayor","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Apurva Sarin","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"Institute For Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)"},{"author_name":"AJAY PARIDA","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Saumitra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

DESIGN In situ microbiological study. SETTING Single NHS Trust, UK. OUTCOME MEASURES Growth of any bacteria or fungi, or positive polymerase chain reaction results for common respiratory viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RESULTS 25 PAPR hoods were swabbed; ten (40%) returned positive results. Bacterial growth was detected on six hoods (bacillus simplex, kocuria rhizophilia, bacillus weihenstephensis, microcccus luteus and staphylococcus epidermidis); five of the hoods were positive for fungal growth (non-sporulating environmental mould, NSEM); all sampled hoods tested negative for both SARS-CoV-2 and an expanded panel of respiratory viruses. There was wide variation in the storage of cleaned hoods. CONCLUSION Despite following recommended cleaning procedures, bacteria and fungi can remain on the internal components of PAPR hoods, at levels significant enough to be swabbed and cultured. PAPR hoods have the potential to cross-infect wearers and patients and are used primarily by clinicians who fail to fit disposable FFP3 respirators; the female sex and non-Caucasian people are less likely to fit FFP3 respirators. The hoods tested cannot be adequately cleaned for use in high risk healthcare environments, PAPR hoods and tubes can act as fomites, and there are evident shortcomings in their provision.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhijoy Chakladar","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire Gabrielle Jones","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jimmy Siu","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex university Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Osman Hassan-Ibrahim","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mansoor Khan","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Mills","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Natalie Wright","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ingelin Testad","author_inst":"Stavanger University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dag Aarsland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Clive Ballard","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lance Stewart","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Satyajit Mayor","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Apurva Sarin","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"Institute For Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)"},{"author_name":"AJAY PARIDA","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Saumitra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.
