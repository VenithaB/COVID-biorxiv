We found that relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated authentic virus-neutralizing titers and antibody levels against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 region of spike protein. Unlike disease severity, age and sex played lesser roles in serological responses. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. RBD- and S2-specific and neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated and stable for at least 2-3 months post-onset, whereas those against N were more variable with rapid declines in many samples. Testing of 5882 self-recruited members of the local community demonstrated that 1.24% of individuals showed antibody reactivity to RBD. However, 18% (13\/73) of these putative seropositive samples failed to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of the neutralizing, but only 1 of the non-neutralizing samples, also displayed potent reactivity to S2. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays markedly improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the viral antigen. In contrast to other reports, we conclude that immunity is durable for at least several months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tyler J Ripperger","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Uhrlaub","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Makiko Watanabe","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Rachel Wong","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Castaneda","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Hannah A Pizzato","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Mallory R Thompson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christine Bradshaw","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Craig C Weinkauf","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christian Bime","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Heidi L Erickson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175265","rel_title":"Assessment of physiological signs associated with COVID-19 measured using wearable devices","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175265","rel_abs":"Respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability are some health metrics that are easily measured by consumer devices and which can potentially provide early signs of illness. Furthermore, mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 - a symptom-based approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced, age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 - July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and 0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +\/- 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +\/- 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a specific day with 4 previous days of history. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while heart rate variability is decreased. Measuring these metrics can help in early diagnosis, and in monitoring the progress of the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aravind Natarajan","author_inst":"Fitbit"},{"author_name":"Hao-Wei Su","author_inst":"Fitbit"},{"author_name":"Conor Heneghan","author_inst":"Fitbit"},{"author_name":"Rachel Wong","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Castaneda","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Hannah A Pizzato","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Mallory R Thompson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christine Bradshaw","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Craig C Weinkauf","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christian Bime","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Heidi L Erickson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175018","rel_title":"Socio-demographic, clinical, hospital admission and oxygen requirement characteristics of COVID-19 patients of Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175018","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Clinical presentation hospital admission and outcome of COVID-19 pandemic are different from one country to another. So every country should have their own data regarding COVID-19. Subjects and Methods: This was an online cross-sectional survey carried out in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 adult patient. A preformed questionnaire adapted in Google form and circulated through online to collect data. Informed consent was ensured before participation in this study. Results: We have studied of 305 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients mean age was 36.32(+\/-12.369) years with male predominance and majority were doctor 46.9%. 48.8% of the patients family members affected along with them. After COVID-19 pandemic 31.7% did not go out of their house. For prevention (72.4%)of the patients used mask and 38.8% used hand gloves during outing. 28.7% reported to be affected while working in hospital 21.8%were affected in their office. Fever (80.1%) cough (57.7%) pain in throat (50.8%) rhinitis (45.9%) and loss of smell (45%) and taste sensation (45.6%) were the most common symptoms. Sample was given average 3 (+\/- 3.384) days after onset of the symptoms and report was delivered average 4.57 days after giving sample. After getting result 32.1% of the patients seek treatment in telemedicine and 23% directly consulted in Government hospital only 2% reported to be treated by the Government designated telephone number. 73.1% of the patient took both steam inhalation and warm water gargling. Paracetamol and antihistamine was the most commonly use drugs 69.8% and 71.5% respectively besides 47.5% took ivermectin 41.6% took azithromycin 35.1% steroid 34.8% took doxycyclin and 21.6% hydroxychloroquine. Among the patients only 20.3% needed hospital admission. The patients admitted in hospital average 5 (+\/-3.922) days after onset of symptoms and hospital staying was 9.2 days (average). Breathless (54.83%) was the major cause of hospital admission and 19.35% patients admitted due to fear. 14% patients needed oxygen and average duration of oxygen was 4.84 days. 81.3% patients has taken oxygen in hospital and 18.8% at their home. Among the patient 2.2% needed ICU and artificial ventilation needed for 1.1% patients. The patients recovered after 17.74 days (average) from the onset of symptom. COVID-19 became negative (RT-PCR) at15th day from onset of symptom. 91.8%) were in mental stress to become the cause of infection spread to other family members 20.7%) reported that they were anxious that they would not get oxygen or ICU if required and 27.9% were suffering from fear of death. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom in 57.4% cases. Average time required for coming back to normal life was 21.59 days (+\/-7.901) ranging a wide range from 5 to 60 days. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients were mostly male health worker. Fever cough pain in throat were most common symptoms. Hospital admission required in only one-fifth cases and ICU required for only 2% patients. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom.

A better understanding of symptoms, comorbidities and medication used for pre-existing conditions in patients with COVID-19 could help healthcare workers identify patients at increased risk of developing more severe disease. Here, we have used self-reported data (symptoms, medications and comorbidities) from more than 3 million users from the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker app12 to identify previously reported and novel features predictive of patients being admitted in a hospital setting. Despite previously reported association between age and more severe disease phenotypes, we found that patient's age, sex and ethnic group were minimally predictive when compared to patient's symptoms and comorbidities. The most important variables selected by our predictive algorithm were fever, the use of immunosuppressant medication, mobility aid, shortness of breath and fatigue. It is anticipated that early administration of preventative measures in COVID-19 positive patients (COVID+) who exhibit a high risk of hospitalization signature may prevent severe disease progression.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yingxiang Huang","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"Dina Radenkovic","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin Perez","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"Kari Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Eric Verdin","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"David Furman","author_inst":"Buck Institute"},{"author_name":"Jafrin Sultana","author_inst":"Society of General Physicians and Daktarkhana (GP center)"},{"author_name":"Moni Rani","author_inst":"Rajshahi Medical College"},{"author_name":"Craig C Weinkauf","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Christian Bime","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Heidi L Erickson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175257","rel_title":"Vaccine optimization for COVID-19, who to vaccinate first?","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175257","rel_abs":"A vaccine, when available, will likely become our best tool to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.

When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age-groups first.

It is assumed that there is no long-term immunity in asymptomatic superspreaders who have under- gone the infection, and the emergence of long-term immunity in those who have undergone severe illness. It is shown that, under these assumptions, the relaxation of quarantine measures leads to the resumption of virus circulation among asymptomatic superspreaders. Depending on the charac- teristics of the quarantine, its removal may or may not lead to a renewed wave of daily morbidity. A criterion for the occurrence and repeated wave of morbidity is proposed based on the analysis of the final phase of the first wave. Based on this criterion, the repeated wave of the epidemic is predicted in New Zealand.

While this suggests a conflict between health protection and economic objectives, we examine whether the economically optimal exit strategy can be reconciled with the containment of the epidemic.

Our findings suggest that a prudent opening is economically optimal, whereas costs are higher for a more extensive opening process. This rejects the view that there is a conflict with health protection. Instead, it is in the common interest of public health and the economy to relax non-pharmaceutical interventions in a manner that keeps the epidemic under control.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Florian Dorn","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University Munich Germany"},{"author_name":"Sahamoddin Khailaie","author_inst":"Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marc Stoeckli","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian C Binder","author_inst":"Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Lautenbacher","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Peichl","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timo Wollmershaeuser","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Fuest","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20170878","rel_title":"Estimating the epidemic growth dynamics within the first week","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20170878","rel_abs":"Information about the early growth of infectious outbreaks are indispensable to estimate the epidemic spreading.

There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. Methods: We addressed both questions using cohort studies derived from an electronic health records (EHR) network of 69 million patients including over 62,000 cases of COVID-19. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Findings: In patients with no prior psychiatric history, COVID-19 was associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric diagnoses in the three months after infection compared to 6 other health events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 2.1 [1.8-2.5] compared to influenza; 1.7 [1.5-1.9] compared to other respiratory tract infections; 1.6 [1.4-1.9] compared to skin infection; 1.6 [1.3.1-9] compared to cholelithiasis; 2.2 [1.9-2.6] compared to urolithiasis, and 2.1 [1.9-2.5] compared to fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The increase was greatest for anxiety disorders but also present for depression, insomnia, and dementia. The results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. There was a ~30% reduction in psychiatric diagnoses in the total EHR population over the same period. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a 65% higher incidence of COVID-19 (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI: 1.59-1.71, p<0.0001). This was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection has both psychiatric sequelae and psychiatric antecedents. Survivors have an increased rate of new onset psychiatric disorders, and prior psychiatric disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. The findings have implications for research into aetiology and highlight the need for clinical services to provide multidisciplinary follow-up, and prompt detection and treatment.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxime Taquet","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sierra Luciano","author_inst":"TriNetX Inc, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"John R Geddes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul J Harrison","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"NICOLA SIGISMONDI","author_inst":"ICT CONSULTANT"},{"author_name":"Stefan Lautenbacher","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Peichl","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timo Wollmershaeuser","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Fuest","author_inst":"ifo Institute - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Knox","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Billie Bixby","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sairam Parthasarathy","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sachin Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bhupinder Natt","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Elaine Cristan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tammer El Aini","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Franz Rischard","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janet Campion","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Madhav Chopra","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael Insel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Afshin Sam","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James L Knepler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Capaldi","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20158535","rel_title":"Impact of contact tracing on COVID-19 mortality: An impact evaluation using surveillance data from Colombia.","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20158535","rel_abs":"Background Contact tracing is a key part of the public health surveillance toolkit. However, it is labor intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations to our knowledge have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country and provides data to support the expansion of contact tracing strategies with the aim of improving infection control. Methods We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N=54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). We proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified, as suggested by WHO guidelines. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental to contain infectious diseases and its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will have a substantial impact on reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andres I.

In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practices and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. Methods A cross-sectional in-person survey (n=6007) was conducted from 14-30 April 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge in the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. Multivariable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46,49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58,61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48,50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ATKURE DEFAR","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Gebeyaw Molla","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Saro Abdella","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Masresha Tessema","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Muhammed Ahmed","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ashenif Tadele","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Fikresilassie Getachew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Bezawit Hailegiorgis","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Eyasu Tigabu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Sabit Ababor Sr.","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ketema Bizuwork","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Assefa Deressa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Geremew Tasew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Addisu kebede","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Daniel Melese","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Andargachew Gashu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kirubel Eshetu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Adamu Tayachew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Mesfin Wossen","author_inst":"mesfinwossen@gmail.com"},{"author_name":"Abduilhafiz Hassen","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Shambel Habebe","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zewdu Assefa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Aschalew Abayneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tollera","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174649","rel_title":"Widespread testing, case isolation and contact tracing may allow safe school reopening with continued moderate physical distancing: a modeling analysis of King County, WA data","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174649","rel_abs":"Background In late March 2020, a \"Stay Home, Stay Healthy\" order was issued in Washington State in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 1, a 4-phase reopening plan began. If implemented without interruptions, all types of public interactions were planned to resume by July 15. We investigated whether adjunctive prevention strategies would allow less restrictive physical distancing to avoid second epidemic waves and secure safe school reopening. Methods We developed a mathematical model, stratifying the population by age (0-19 years, 20-49 years, 50-69 years, and 70+ years), infection status (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, recovered) and treatment status (undiagnosed, diagnosed, hospitalized) to project SARS-CoV-2 transmission during and after the reopening period. The model was parameterized with demographic and contact data from King County, WA and calibrated to confirmed cases, deaths (overall and by age) and epidemic peak timing. Adjunctive prevention interventions were simulated assuming different levels of pre-COVID physical interactions (pC_PI) restored. We made several predictions related to adjunctive interventions or increased pC_PI. Results The best model fit estimated ~35% pC_PI under lockdown. Gradually restoring 75% pC_PI for all age groups between May 15-July 15 resulted in ~350 daily deaths by early September 2020. Maintaining less than 45% pC_PI was required with current testing practices to ensure low levels of daily infections and deaths. If widespread community transmission persisted, isolating the elderly does not lower daily death rates significantly. Increased testing, isolation of symptomatic infections, and contact tracing permitted 60% pC_PI without significant increases in daily deaths before September, although this strategy may not be sufficient to eliminate community transmission. This combination strategy also allowed opening of schools with <15 daily deaths. Inpatient antiviral treatment reduces deaths significantly without lowering cases or hospitalizations. Conclusions We predict that widespread implementation of \"test and isolate\" policy alone is insufficient to prevent the rapid re-emergence of SARS CoV-2 without moderate physical distancing. However, widespread testing, contact tracing and case isolation would allow relaxation of physical distancing, as well as opening of schools, without a surge in local cases and deaths.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chloe Bracis","author_inst":"Ifremer, France"},{"author_name":"Eileen Burns","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"Mia Moore","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"David Swan","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"Daniel B Reeves","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Schiffer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Dobromir T Dimitrov","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Bezawit Hailegiorgis","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Eyasu Tigabu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Sabit Ababor Sr.","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ketema Bizuwork","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Assefa Deressa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Geremew Tasew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Addisu kebede","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Daniel Melese","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Andargachew Gashu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kirubel Eshetu","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Adamu Tayachew","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Mesfin Wossen","author_inst":"mesfinwossen@gmail.com"},{"author_name":"Abduilhafiz Hassen","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Shambel Habebe","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zewdu Assefa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Aschalew Abayneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tollera","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20168088","rel_title":"Robust, reproducible clinical patterns in hospitalised patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20168088","rel_abs":"Background Severe COVID-19 is characterised by fever, cough, and dyspnoea.

We validated our findings in a second group of 33 534 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in 4 445 cases recruited to a separate study of community cases. Findings Unsupervised clustering identified distinct sub-groups. First, a core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea, which co-occurred with additional symptoms in three further patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were also identified, alongside a subgroup of patients reporting few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis within the ISARIC-4C study. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4 445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. Interpretation The large scale of the ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom group: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan E Millar","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Lucile Neyton","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sohan Seth","author_inst":"Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"National Infection Service, Public Health England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Laura Merson","author_inst":"ISARIC Global Support Centre, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Srinivas Murthy","author_inst":"BC Childrens Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sean Keating","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Maaike Swets","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Carole H Sudre","author_inst":"School of Biomedical and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Spector","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"ZOE Global Ltd., London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Annemarie B Docherty","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Semple","author_inst":"NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Division of Functional Genetics and Development, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Shambel Habebe","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zewdu Assefa","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Aschalew Abayneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tollera","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Spier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Dake","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Taylor Edwards","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Matthew E Kaplan","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Serena Jain Scott","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Cameron Hypes","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Jarrod Mosier","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"David T Harris","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Bonnie J Lafleur","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sprissler","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Janko Nikolich-Zugich","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Deepta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"University of Arizona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175240","rel_title":"The limits of estimating COVID-19 intervention effects using Bayesian models","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175240","rel_abs":"To limit the rapid spread of COVID-19, most governments have introduced different non-pharmaceutical interventions, which might have severe costs for society.

This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Several use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these novel, nucleic acid based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. We describe a monomeric, glycan engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 214mg\/L in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100{degrees}C when lyophilized, upto 70{degrees}C in solution and stable for over four weeks at 37{degrees}C. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59 like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic. These features of high yield, extreme thermotolerance and satisfactory immunogenicity suggest that such RBD subunit vaccine formulations hold great promise to combat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sameer Kumar Malladi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Randhir Singh","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Pandey","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Savitha Gayathri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Kawkab Kanjo","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Shahbaz Ahmed","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Suhail Khan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Parismita Kalita","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Girish","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Aditya Upadhyaya","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Poorvi Reddy","author_inst":"Mynvax Private Limited, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Ishika Pramanick","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Munmun Bhasin","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Shailendra Mani","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, India"},{"author_name":"Sankar Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, India"},{"author_name":"Jeswin Joseph","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram (IISER TVM), Kerala, India."},{"author_name":"Karthika Thankamani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram (IISER TVM), Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"V.

Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from ten COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb CV07-209 neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 of 3.1 ng\/ml. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 [A] revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jakob Kreye","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"S Momsen Reincke","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Hans-Christian Kornau","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Elisa Sanchez-Sendin","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite -

The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral\/intranasal\/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral\/intranasal\/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David A Meekins","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Igor Morozov","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Jessie D Trujillo","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Natasha N Gaudreault","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Dashzeveg Bold","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Bianca L Artiaga","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Sabarish V Indran","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Taeyong Kwon","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Velmurugan Balaraman","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Daniel W Madden","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamie Henningson","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State Uni"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic Medicine\/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA and Department of Veterinary Pathobi"},{"author_name":"Udeni B.R.

Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria G Noval","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria E Kaczmarek","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Koide","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bruno A Rodriguez-Rodriguez","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ping Louie","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takuya Tada","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takamitsu Hattori","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Panchenko","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Larizbeth A Romero","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kai Wen Teng","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bazley","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maren de Vries","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Weiser","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Aifantis","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joan Cangiarella","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ludovic Desvignes","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Meike Dittmann","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel R Landau","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria E Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Shohei Koide","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth A Stapleford Jr.","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Paula Charlotte Barthel","author_inst":"Charite -

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K\/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K\/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siqi Wu","author_inst":"1.

The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. Methods: We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Tromsoe, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Results: We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04-0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01-0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what Ferguson et al. have previously estimated for influenza pandemics [1]. Conclusion: We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R-estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools.

However there are reports that some people continue to experience symptoms even beyond the stage of acute infection. This phenomenon has been called longcovid. Study design: This study attempted to analyse symptoms reported by users on twitter self-identifying as longcovid. Methods: The search was carried out using the twitter public streaming application programming interface using a relevant search term. Results: We could identify 89 users with usable data in the tweets posted by them. A majority of users described multiple symptoms the most common of which were fatigue, shortness of breath, pain and brainfog\/concentration difficulties. The most common course of symptoms was episodic. Conclusions: Given the public health importance of this issue, the study suggests that there is a need to better study post acute-COVID symptoms.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shubh Mohan Singh","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh India"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Reddy","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh India"},{"author_name":"Per Kirsten Jakobsen","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Elinor Ytterstad","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Ola Lovsletten","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Claus Klingenberg","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Rypdal","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Lijun Liu","author_inst":"1.

Method: We analyzed 301,606 Tweets related to family violence and COVID-19 from April 12 to July 16, 2020, for this study. We used the machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and identified salient themes, topics, and representative Twitter examples. Results: We extracted nine themes on family violence and COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the Impact of COVID-19 on family violence (e.g., rising rates, hotline calls increased, murder & homicide); (2) the types (e.g., child abuse, domestic violence, sexual violence) and (3) forms of family violence (e.g., physical aggression, coercive control); (4) risk factors of family violence (e.g., alcohol abuse, financial constraints, gun, quarantine); (5) victims of family violence (e.g., LGBTQ, women, and women of color, children); (6) social services of family violence (e.g., hotlines, social workers, confidential services, shelters, funding); (7) law enforcement response (e.g., 911 calls, police arrest, protective orders, abuse reports); (8) Social movement\/ awareness (e.g., support victims, raise awareness); and (9) domestic violence-related news (e.g., Tara Reade, Melissa Derosa). Conclusions: The COVID-19 has an impact on family violence. This report overcomes the limitation of existing scholarship that lacks data for consequences of COVID-19 on family violence. We contribute to the understanding of family violence during the pandemic by providing surveillance in Tweets, which is essential to identify potentially effective policy programs in offering targeted support for victims and survivors and preparing for the next wave.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Xue","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Junxiang Chen","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Ran Hu","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tingshao Zhu","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Claus Klingenberg","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Rypdal","author_inst":"UiT The Arctic University of Norway"},{"author_name":"Lijun Liu","author_inst":"1.

Methods We analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates ranged from February 27th 2020, to May 15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated subjects with (hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity, and the use of steroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome, including dexamethasone. Results Among 1893 included subjects, 21-day mortality was 23.4% in 1552 subjects treated in hospitals that routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 17.0% in 341 subjects that were treated in hospitals that did not. In the adjusted Cox-regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95%CI 0.88-1.55). When stratified by actually received treatment in individual subjects, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.25-2.01) in the full model. Conclusions After adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, compared with hospitals that did not. We compared outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of indication bias. This study adds evidence against the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edgar JG Peters","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Didier Collard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Sander van Assen","author_inst":"Treant zorggroep"},{"author_name":"Martijn Beudel","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marije K Bomers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Buijs","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lianne de Haan","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Wouter de Ruijter","author_inst":"Noordwest ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"Renee Douma","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Paul WG Elbers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"A Goorhuis","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"N C Gritters van den Oever","author_inst":"Treant Zorggroep"},{"author_name":"G HH Knarren","author_inst":"Viecurie MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"H S Moeniralam","author_inst":"St Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"R LM Mostard","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M JR Quanjel","author_inst":"St. Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"A C Reidinga","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"R Renckens","author_inst":"Noordwest Ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"J PW van den Bergh","author_inst":"Viecuri MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"Imro N Vlasveld","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonne J Sikkens","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Shohei Koide","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth A Stapleford Jr.","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Paula Charlotte Barthel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Karl Skriner","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Andreas C Hocke","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christiana Franke","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Matthias Endres","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Dietmar Schmitz","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Lara Maria Jeworowski","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Anja Richter","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marie Luisa Schmidt","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Tatjana Schwarz","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marcel Alexander Mueller","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Leif E Sander","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Ian A Wilson","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA."},{"author_name":"Harald Pruess","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174318","rel_title":"Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Southwest Ethiopia.","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174318","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals which can affect people physically and psychologically. The older people and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness and death. Objective the aim of this study was to determine Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Bench-Sheko,West Omo and Keffa Zones, southwest Ethiopia Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was applied among 613 adults with chronic disease. A simple sampling technique was applied. Correlational analysis was used to determine the relationship between the COVID-19 related stress score and coping strategy types. To measure the strength of association between dependent variables and independent variables and Pearson coefficients (r) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Finally, the variable, which shows statistical significance (p-value < 0.05 cut point) were used to quantify the associations among variables. Results: Around 613 participants of 96% response rate were participated. About 68.4% were moderately stressed; low stress was 17.8% and severe stress was 13.9 %. Covid-19 related perceived stress score were positively associated with coping strategies types of like sell-distraction, active coping, denial, emotional support, behavioral disengagement, venting, and use of instrument, positive reframing, self-blaming, planning, humoring and religion. The most preferable types of coping strategies were religious, instrumental and active coping strategies and while the least used were substance used. Conclusion: Significant numbers of participants were suffered from severe perceived stress due to covid-19 outbreak in this study area. Both adaptive and maladaptive Coping strategy types were significantly associated with stress. Substance use and self-blaming were the types coping strategies which were not associated with perceived stress.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abel Girma","author_inst":"Mizan-Tepi university"},{"author_name":"Ermias Ayalew","author_inst":"mizan-tepi university"},{"author_name":"Sander van Assen","author_inst":"Treant zorggroep"},{"author_name":"Martijn Beudel","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marije K Bomers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Buijs","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lianne de Haan","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Wouter de Ruijter","author_inst":"Noordwest ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"Renee Douma","author_inst":"Flevoziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Paul WG Elbers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"A Goorhuis","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"N C Gritters van den Oever","author_inst":"Treant Zorggroep"},{"author_name":"G HH Knarren","author_inst":"Viecurie MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"H S Moeniralam","author_inst":"St Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"R LM Mostard","author_inst":"Zuyderland Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M JR Quanjel","author_inst":"St. Antonius Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"A C Reidinga","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"R Renckens","author_inst":"Noordwest Ziekenhuisgroep"},{"author_name":"J PW van den Bergh","author_inst":"Viecuri MC Noord-Limburg"},{"author_name":"Imro N Vlasveld","author_inst":"Martini Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonne J Sikkens","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Shohei Koide","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth A Stapleford Jr.","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Paula Charlotte Barthel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Karl Skriner","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Andreas C Hocke","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christiana Franke","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Matthias Endres","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Dietmar Schmitz","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Lara Maria Jeworowski","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Anja Richter","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marie Luisa Schmidt","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Tatjana Schwarz","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marcel Alexander Mueller","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Leif E Sander","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Ian A Wilson","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA."},{"author_name":"Harald Pruess","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20173393","rel_title":"Pre-COVID-19 humoral immunity to common coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20173393","rel_abs":"It is currently unknown whether acquired immunity to common alpha- and beta-coronaviruses provides cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Collectively, the results of our study indicate that pre-existing immunity to common coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Delphine Sterlin","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Stephane Marot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Alexis Mathian","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Mo Atif","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Paul Quentric","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Audrey Mohr","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Claer","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Karim Dorgham","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Christophe Parizot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Hans Yssel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Chazal","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Jehane Fadlallah","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Julien Haroche","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Neila Benameur","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"David Boutolleau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Sonia Burrel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Sasi Mudumba","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Rick Hockett","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Cary Genalyte","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Calvez","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Anne-Genevieve Marcelin","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christiana Franke","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Matthias Endres","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Dietmar Schmitz","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Lara Maria Jeworowski","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Anja Richter","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marie Luisa Schmidt","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Tatjana Schwarz","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marcel Alexander Mueller","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Leif E Sander","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Ian A Wilson","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA."},{"author_name":"Harald Pruess","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174482","rel_title":"Comparison of COVID-19 Infections Among Healthcare Workers and Non-Healthcare Workers","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174482","rel_abs":"Objectives Healthcare workers face distinct occupational challenges that affect their personal health, especially during a pandemic. In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW). Methods We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State. We routinely collect data on occupation and exposures to suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results From March 1 2020 through June 2020, 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+\/-19 years, 53% male) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and known HCW status visited the ED. This included 193 (6.8%) known HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) non-HCWs. Compared with non-HCW, HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118\/193 vs 1211\/2649, P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161\/193 vs 946\/2649, P<0.001), but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of tachypnea (12\/193 vs 426\/2649, P<0.01), hypoxemia (15\/193 vs 564\/2649, P<0.01), bilateral opacities on imaging (38\/193 vs 1189\/2649, P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6\/193 vs 532\/2649, P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more frequent in HCW 154\/193: 80% vs 1275\/2649: 48% p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38\/193 20% vs 1264\/2694 47%, P<0.001), ICU admissions (7\/193 3% vs 321\/2694 12%, P<0.001), need for IMV (6\/193 3% vs 321\/2694 12%, P<0.001) and mortality (2\/193 1% vs 219\/2694 8%, P<0.01) were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9) than non HCW. Conclusions Compared with non HCW, HCW with Covid-19 were younger, had less severe illness, and were less likely to be admitted.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Kim","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nachman","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Rafael Fernandes","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Kristen Meyers","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Maria Taylor","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Debra LeBlanc","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Adam Singer","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Audrey Mohr","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Claer","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Karim Dorgham","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Christophe Parizot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Hans Yssel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Chazal","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Jehane Fadlallah","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Julien Haroche","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Neila Benameur","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"David Boutolleau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Sonia Burrel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Sasi Mudumba","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Rick Hockett","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Cary Genalyte","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Calvez","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Anne-Genevieve Marcelin","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christiana Franke","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Matthias Endres","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Dietmar Schmitz","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Lara Maria Jeworowski","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Anja Richter","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marie Luisa Schmidt","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Tatjana Schwarz","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Marcel Alexander Mueller","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Leif E Sander","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany."},{"author_name":"Ian A Wilson","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA."},{"author_name":"Harald Pruess","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174136","rel_title":"Genomic Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 During Early Introduction into the United States National Capital Region","rel_date":"2020-08-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174136","rel_abs":"Background: The early COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by rapid global spread. In the United States National Capital Region, over 2,000 cases were reported within three weeks of its first detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the region. By correlating genetic information to disease phenotype, we also aimed to gain insight into any correlation between viral genotype and case severity or transmissibility. Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing of clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in March 2020 by the Johns Hopkins Health System, building on methods developed by the ARTIC network. We analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and the global phylogeny to understand early establishment of the virus within the region. Results: We analyzed 620 samples from the Johns Hopkins Health System collected between March 11-31, 2020, comprising 37.3% of the total cases in Maryland during this period. We selected 143 of these samples for sequencing, generating 114 complete viral genomes. These genomes belonged to all five major Nextstrain-defined clades, suggesting multiple introductions into the region and underscoring the diversity of the regional epidemic. We also found that clinically severe cases had genomes belonging to all of these clades. Conclusions: We established a pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within the Johns Hopkins Health system, which enabled us to capture the significant viral diversity present in the region as early as March 2020. Efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter M.
