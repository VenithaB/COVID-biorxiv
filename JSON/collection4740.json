High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill patients, but information regarding the timing of HFNC application is scarce, especially in elderly patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 elderly patients ([&ge;]65 years) who received HFNC from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, People's Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shishou City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, People's Hospital of Yangjiang City, People's Hospital of Maoming City in Guangdong Province, China. Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2\/FiO2 [&le;] 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72 patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2\/FiO2 [&le;] 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the prognosis was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC. This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liehua Deng","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine of affiliated hospital of Guangdong Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shaoqing Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"David A.

We aimed to explore the association of RAAS inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. Methods: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library were searched for the period of January 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Studies reporting the association of RAAS inhibitors (ACEi and ARBs) and mortality in patients with hypertension, hospitalized for COVID-19 were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. Results: Data were collected on 2,065,805 individuals (mean age, 58.73 years; 53.4% male). Patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors were 35% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to patients with hypertension not taking RAAS inhibitors (pooled RR= 0.65, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.45-0.94). To explore the association of COVID-19 and specific classes of RAAS inhibitors, we conducted a subgroup analysis of ARBs and ACEi separately from studies that provided them. Pooled risk ratio estimates from ARBs and ACEi showed a lower but not significant risk of death from COVID-19 (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.70-1.22) and ACEi (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.30). Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, it was discovered that taking RAAS inhibitors, significantly decreased the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. This indicates a potential protective role that RAAS-inhibitors may have in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Ssentongo","author_inst":"Penn State University"},{"author_name":"Paddy Ssentongo","author_inst":"Penn State University"},{"author_name":"Emily S.

Unlocking of the economies critically imposes extra burden on testing and quarantine of the infected people to keep the reproduction number (R0) <1. This, as we demonstrate, requires optimizing a cost-benefit trade-off between testing rate and unlock extent. We delineate a strategy to optimize the trade-off by utilizing a data-trained epidemic model and coupling it with a stochastic agent based model to implement contact tracing.

A particularly unstable federal regime and fragile socioeconomic situation is likely to have contributed to the impact of the disease. Amid this crisis there is substantial concern in the possible socioeconomic, geopolitical and ethnic inequity of the impact of COVID-19 on the country's particularly diverse population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using observational data from the SIVEP-Gripe dataset. We present descriptive statistics to quantify the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. We assess the importance of regional factors such as education, income and health either on a state-by-state basis or by splitting Brazil into a North and a Central-South region. Mixed-effects survival analysis was used to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings: Our results show that, compared to branco comparators, hospitalised pardo and preto Brazilians have significantly higher risk of mortality, with hazard ratios and 95% CI of 1.47 (1.33-1.58) and 1.32 (1.15-1.52), respectively. In particular, pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age). We also found that hospitalised Brazilians in North regions tend to have more comorbidities than in the Central-South, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. Finally, we found that states in the North have a higher hazard ratio as compared to the Central-South, and that Rio de Janeiro obtained one of the highest hazard ratios, similar to the ones of the more underdeveloped Pernambuco and Amazonas. Interpretation: Our results can be interpreted according to the interplay of two independent, but correlated, effects: i) mortality by COVID-19 increases going North (vertical effect), ii) mortality increases for the pardo and preto population (horizontal effect). We speculate that the vertical effect is driven by increasing levels of comorbidity in Northern regions where levels of socioeconomic development are lower, whereas the horizontal effect may be related to lower levels of healthcare access or availability (including intensive care) for pardo and preto Brazilians. For most states the vertical and horizontal effects are correlated giving a larger cumulative mortality. However, Rio de Janeiro was found to be an outlier to this trend: It has an ethnicity composition (horizontal effect) similar to the states in the North region, despite high levels of socioeconomic development (vertical effect). Our analysis motivates an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect pardo and preto Brazilians as well as the population of poorer states from their higher death risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Otavio Baqui","author_inst":"Federal University of Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Ioana Bica","author_inst":"University of Oxford; The Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerio Marra","author_inst":"Federal University of Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Ari Ercole","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Mihaela Van Der Schaar","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; University of Cambridge; University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chigozie A.

In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis after the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID- 19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as (a) COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds, (b) COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data, (c) COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and (d) knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19. We survey and compare research works in these directions that are accompanied by open source data and code. Future research directions for data-driven COVID-19 research are also debated.

Some interventions used to give oxygen therapy are aerosol generating procedures. Staff delivering such interventions require PPE and are exposed to a significant viral load resulting in sick days and even death. We aim to reduce this risk using an augmented-reality communication device: The HoloLens by Microsoft. OBJECTIVES: In a tertiary centre in London we aim to implement HoloLens technology, allowing other medical staff to remotely join the consulting clinician when in a high-risk patient area delivering oxygen therapy. The study primary outcome was to reduce the exposure to staff and demonstrate non-inferiority staff satisfaction when compared to not using the device. Our secondary outcome was to reduce extrapolated PPE costs when using the device. METHODS: Our study was conducted in March and April 2020, within a respiratory unit delivering aerosolising oxygen therapies (High flow nasal oxygen, Continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation) to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported questionnaires to assess satisfaction in key areas of patient care. An infrared people counting device was also used to assess staff in and out of the unit. MAIN RESULTS: Mean self-reported time in the high-risk zone was less when using HoloLens (2.69 hours) compared to usual practice (3.96 hours) although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.3657). HoloLens showed non-inferiority when compared to usual practice in staff satisfaction score for all domains. Furthermore, mean staff satisfaction score encouragingly improved when using HoloLens. Self-reported PPE counts from this study showed 12 staff members changing PPE 25.8 times per shift, almost double the 13.5 times in the HoloLens count. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated HoloLens can reduce the number of staff exposed to aerosol generating areas in a novel infectious disease. Our results show it did not impair communication, medical staff availability or end of life care. HoloLens technology may also reduce the use of PPE, which has equipment availability and cost benefits. This study provides grounding for further use of the HoloLens device by bringing a bedside experience to experts remote to the situation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John J Cafferkey","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dominic OP Hampson","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London UK"},{"author_name":"Clare Ross","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London UK"},{"author_name":"Angad S Kooner","author_inst":"Cutrale Perioperative and Ageing Research Group, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy FJ Martin","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"James M Kinross","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Margaret R.

We reviewed neurological manifestations due to the new coronavirus, thus far published in the literature, as well as guidelines issued by sub-specialties in Neurology, to tackle the disease. Methods: we searched medical databases, such as PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS and Google scholar for papers (case reports, short letters, case series, etc) describing neurological symptoms in patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 diagnosis and also searched webpages of associations and organizations that deal with neurological disorders. Results: we describe briefly each article considered for this review. Forty-one papers were found associating neurological conditions and COVID-19. Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group. Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death. Although a lot of data coming from these papers is amassing, researchers must bear in mind that many papers currently published are not yet peer-reviewed, and thus are prone to further corrections.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paulo Afonso Mei","author_inst":"S\u00e3o Leopoldo Mandic College"},{"author_name":"Laura Loeb","author_inst":"S\u00e3o Leopoldo Mandic College"},{"author_name":"Clare Ross","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London UK"},{"author_name":"Angad S Kooner","author_inst":"Cutrale Perioperative and Ageing Research Group, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy FJ Martin","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"James M Kinross","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Margaret R.

Concurrently, there were nine COVID-19 patients clinically unlinked to clusters #1 or #2 that necessitated the determination of the source of infection. Such patients had similar haplotypes to that in cluster #2 but were devoid of two rare mutations characteristic to cluster #2. This suggested that these nine cases of \"probable community infection\" indeed had community infection and were not derived from cluster #2.

During infectious disease outbreaks the weakest communities are more vulnerable to the infection and its deleterious effects. In Israel, the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have unique demographic and cultural characteristics that place them at risk for infection. Objective. To examine the socioeconomic and ethnic differences in relation to COVID-19 testing, cases and deaths, and to analyze infection spread patterns in ethnically diverse communities. Methods. Consecutive data on COVID-19 diagnostic testing, confirmed cases and deaths collected from March 31st through May 1st, 2020 in 174 localities across Israel (84% of the population) were analyzed by socioeconomic ranking and ethnicity. Findings. Tests were performed on 331,594 individuals (4.29% of the total population). Of those, 14,865 individuals (4.48%) were positive and 203 died (1.37% of confirmed cases). The percentage of the population tested was 26% and the risk of testing positive was 2.16 times higher in the lowest, compared with the highest socioeconomic category. The proportion of confirmed cases was 4.96 times higher in the Jewish compared with the Arab population. The rate of confirmed cases in 2 Ultra-Orthodox localities increased relatively early and quickly. Other Jewish and Arab localities showed consistently low rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of socioeconomic ranking. Interpretation Culturally different communities reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak and to government measures, resulting in different outcomes. Therefore, socioeconomic and ethnic variables cannot fully explain communities reaction to the pandemic. Our findings stress the need for designing a culturally adapted approach for dealing with health crises.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mor Saban","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Epidemiology & Health Policy Research"},{"author_name":"Tal Shachar","author_inst":"Bar ilan university"},{"author_name":"Oren Miron","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheba, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rachel Wilf Meron","author_inst":"Gertner Institue of Epidemiology & Health Policy Research"},{"author_name":"Yoshifumi Uwamino","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shunsuke Uno","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Asami Osada","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naoki Hasegawa","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mitsuru Murata","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Toru Takebayashi","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Koichi Fukunaga","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hideyuki Saya","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuko Kitagawa","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Amagai","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haruhiko Siomi","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenjiro Kosaki","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jing Tang","author_inst":"The Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated hospital of Guangdong Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengyuan Xia","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20107607","rel_title":"Chansu Injection Improves the Respiratory Function of Severe COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20107607","rel_abs":"Chansu and its major active constituent of bufalin have been reported to have broad-spectrum antiviral effects.

The elevated infection rates among women of working age are likely tied to their higher share in health- and care-related occupations.

Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine-tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers\/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3' end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene\/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3' end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer\/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated. The genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the early identification of mutations in critical regions and to issue recommendations on specific diagnostic tests to ensure the coverage of locally-circulating genetic variants.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Alejandro Alvarez-Diaz","author_inst":"Grupo de Salud Materna y Perinatal.

The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns in addition to clinical conditions needing treatment. Wherever ventilators are employed, additional tubing and splitting adaptors may be available. Adjustable flow-compensating resistance for differences in lung compliance on individual limbs may not be readily implementable. By exploring a number and range of possible contributing factors using computational simulation without risk of patient harm, this paper attempts to define useful bounds for ventilation parameters when compensatory resistance in limbs of a shared breathing circuit is not possible. This desperate approach to shared ventilation support would be a last resort when alternatives have been exhausted. Methods - A whole-body computational physiology model (using lumped parameters) was used to simulate each patient being ventilated. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. In addition to lung mechanics or estimation of CO2and pH expected for set ventilation parameters (considerations of lung physiology alone), full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. Findings - To be useful for clinicians, attention has been directed to clinically available parameters. These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and end-tidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 mL\/cmH2O, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. Interpretation - In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if that option is unavailable and ventilator sharing using limbs without flow resistance compensation is the only available alternative, these simulations provide a conceptual framework and guidelines for clinical patient selection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey B.

At the same time, the imaging features of CT in confirmed COVID-19 patients would be summarized. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of 5 electronic databases was performed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated using the random-effects model and the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. We also conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled incidence of the chest CT imaging findings and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. Results: Overall, 25 articles comprising 4,857 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity of CT was 93% (95% CI, 89-96%) and specificity was 44% (95% CI, 27-62%). The area under the SROC curve was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96). For the RT-PCR assay, the pooled sensitivity of the initial test and the missed diagnosis rate after the second-round test were 76% (95% CI: 59-89%; I2=96%) and 26% (95% CI: 14-39%; I2=45%), respectively. According to the subgroup analysis, the diagnostic sensitivity of CT in Hubei was higher than that in other regions. Besides, the most common patterns on CT imaging finding was ground glass opacities (GGO) 58% (95% CI: 49-70%), followed by air bronchogram 51% (95% CI: 31-70%). Lesions were inclined to distribute in peripheral 64% (95% CI: 49-78%), and the incidence of bilateral lung involvement was 69% (95% CI: 58-79%). Conclusions: There were still several cases of missed diagnosis after multiple RT-PCR examinations. In high-prevalence areas, CT could be recommended as an auxiliary screening method for RT-PCR.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kai Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiuting Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuhui Zhong","author_inst":"The first affiliated hospital of guangxi medical university"},{"author_name":"Wanyue Qin","author_inst":"The first affiliated hospital of guangxi medical university"},{"author_name":"Zhenxi Zhang","author_inst":"The first affiliated hospital of guangxi medical university"},{"author_name":"Amirul Aizad Ahmad Fuad","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nurfarhana Hassan","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"S.

Data extraction and synthesis: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and OpenGrey from inception to 1st April 2020. Methodological quality was assessed using the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies and Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies. Results: We screened 3,360 titles and included 112 studies with 21 different drug classes identified as influencing ACE2 activity. Ten studies were in humans and 102 were in animal models None examined ACE2 in human lungs. The most frequently examined drugs were Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) (n= 55) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme- Inhibitors (ACE-I) (n= 22). More studies reported upregulation than downregulation with ACE-I (n=22), ARBs (n=55), insulin (n=8), thiazolidinedione (n=7) aldosterone agonists (n=3), statins (n=5), oestrogens (n=5) calcium channel-blockers (n=3) GLP-1 agonists (n=2) and NSAIDs (n=2). Conclusions: There is an abundance of academic literature and media reports on the potential of drugs that could attenuate or exacerbate COVID-19 disease. This is leading to trials of repurposed drugs and uncertainty amongst patients and clinicians concerning continuation or cessation of prescribed medications. Our review indicates that the impact of currently prescribed drugs on ACE2 has been poorly studied in-vivo, particularly in human lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to enact its pathogenic effects. We found no convincing evidence to justify starting or stopping currently prescribed drugs to influence outcomes of COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hajira Dambha-Miller","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ali Albasri","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sam Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Wilcox","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Shareen Khan","author_inst":"Oxford Health Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nazrul Nazrul Islam","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Little","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Simon J Griffin","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Juliana Barbosa-Ramirez","author_inst":"Grupo de Virologia, Direccion de Redes en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Erika X Ospitia-Baez","author_inst":"Grupo de Virologia, Direccion de Redes en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Diana M Walteros","author_inst":"Direccion de Vigilancia en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Martha L Ospina Martinez","author_inst":"Direccion General, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Marcela Mercado-Reyes","author_inst":"Direccion de Investigacion en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Amagai","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haruhiko Siomi","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenjiro Kosaki","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jing Tang","author_inst":"The Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated hospital of Guangdong Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengyuan Xia","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108704","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Measuring differences in individual precautionary behaviors among young adults","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108704","rel_abs":"Aim: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already hit Bangladesh, and various control measures have been taken to flatten the epidemic curve. Due to the current demographic distribution in Bangladesh, young adults are vital to the demography of the country. Therefore, their precautionary behavior is very important to ensure the success of preventive policies. This exploratory study examined the differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors among young adults, and estimated and compared the predictors of precautionary behavior adoption among young adults living in the capital city Dhaka and a nearby district, Tangail. Subject and Methods: A total of 350 respondents from each district participated in the study. ANOVA and two-sample t-tests were utilized to detect differences in precautionary behavior across demographic groups of young adults, and quantile regression modeling was used to find the predictors of adopting precautionary behaviors and to compare these predictors between the two districts. Results: Individuals who had a postgraduate education and had good mental health tended to show better precautionary behaviors in Dhaka. Female respondents from Tangail who had no psychological distress took precautionary behaviors more often than their counterparts. However, no significant differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among young adults were found between the two districts. Better self-control ability, higher education, and good mental health emerged as factors that significantly shaped the precautionary behaviors of young adults in this study. Conclusion: Having better knowledge did not ensure better adoption of precautionary behaviors among the participants. In effect, strong intervention by the government to keep people at home and distant from each other and continued lockdown for several more days are probable immediate solutions. At the same time, the economic burden on lower-income people should be addressed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Imtiaz","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Md.

Methods Building upon previous work, automated HRCT measures of small blood vessel volume and pulmonary vascular density were developed. Scans from 103 COVID-19 patients and 108 healthy volunteers were analyzed and their results compared, with comparisons made both on lobar and global levels. Results Compared to healthy volunteers, COVID-19 patients showed significant reduction in BV5 (pulmonary blood volume contained in blood vessels of <5 mm2) expressed as BV5\/(Total pulmonary blood volume) (p<0.0001), and significant increases in BV5_10 and BV 10 (pulmonary blood volumes contained in vessels between 5 and 10 mm2 and above 10 mm2, respectively) (p<0.0001). These changes were consistent across lobes. Conclusions COVID-19 patients display striking anomalies in the distribution of blood volume within the pulmonary vascular tree, consistent with increased pulmonary vasculature resistance in the pulmonary vessels below the resolution of HRCT.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muriel Lins","author_inst":"General Hospital Sint-Maarten, Mechelen, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jan Vandevenne","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk, Belgium; Faculty of Medicine, University of Hasselt, Diepenbeek, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Muhunthan Thillai","author_inst":"Department of Interstitial Lung Disease, Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben R.

Conclusion HFNT use is associated with a reduction in the rate of Invasive mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maulin Patel","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gangemi","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert Marron","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junad Chowdhury","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ibraheem Yousef","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zheng","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Mills","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lauren Tragesser","author_inst":"Lewis Katz school of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Julie Giurintano","author_inst":"Lewis Katz School Of Medicine at Temple Univerisity"},{"author_name":"Rohit Gupta","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Gordon","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Parth Rali","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Zhao","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard J Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Tang","author_inst":"The Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated hospital of Guangdong Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengyuan Xia","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111682","rel_title":"Evaluation of ELISA tests for the qualitative determination of IgG, IgM and IgA to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111682","rel_abs":"Serological assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are now of critical importance to support diagnosis, guide epidemiological intervention, and understand immune response to natural infection and vaccine administration. We developed and validated new anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA tests (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.) based on whole-virus antigens. We used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions. Overall, the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially for IgG and IgA, we observed high sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively); specificity was high (>96%) for all antibody types ELISAs. In addition, sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset (DSO) due to the seroconversion window, and for ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 DSO, respectively. The results showed that ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, covering all different antibody types developed in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Colavita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Alessandra Brogi","author_inst":"DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a."},{"author_name":"Daniele Lapa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Licia Bordi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Giulia Matusali","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Silvia Meschi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Patrizia Marsella","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Giulia Tesi","author_inst":"DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a."},{"author_name":"Tommaso Bandini","author_inst":"DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a."},{"author_name":"Antonino Di Caro","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Spallanzani\""},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Zhao","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard J Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Tang","author_inst":"The Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated hospital of Guangdong Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengyuan Xia","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20109777","rel_title":"A benchmark of online COVID-19 symptom checkers","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20109777","rel_abs":"Background A large number of online COVID-19 symptom checkers and chatbots have been developed but anecdotal evidence suggests that their conclusions are highly variable.

Methods The first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection case in Wuhan was admitted in hospital for quarantine and observation. The T cell responses were followed up by flow cytometry analysis of the peripheral blood nonnuclear cells (PBMCs) at days 7, 13, 22, and 28 after admission. Findings We found the first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan is an asymptomatic case. His T cell differentiation, proliferation and activation matched the classical kinetics of T cell responses induced by viral infection, but the activation maintained at a relatively low level. Function analysis indicated frequencies of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were notably lower than that of the healthy controls (HC) at day 7, and then rebound gradually. But IFN-{gamma}+CD8+ T cells were detained at a significant lower level even at day 28, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus had already become undetectable for 3 weeks. Moreover, percentage of IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells was also detained constantly at a much lower level compared to HC. At day 7, although percentage of Tregs was in normal range, the frequency of activated Treg (aTreg) was remarkably as high as 4.4-fold of that in HC. Interpretation The T cell activation in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a significant suppression and presented impairment of Th1\/Th17 and CD8+ T cell functions. Early elevation of the aTregs might play role in the activation and function of T cells in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingyi Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Ejuan Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Maohua Zhong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),"},{"author_name":"Qingyu Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ke Hong","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ting Shu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Dihan Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Xia","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Dingyu Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chaolin Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"You Shang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huimin Yan","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard J Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Tang","author_inst":"The Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated hospital of Guangdong Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengyuan Xia","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111724","rel_title":"COVID-19: Impact of Obesity and Diabetes in Disease Severity","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111724","rel_abs":"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic is straining the healthcare system, particularly for patients with severe outcomes who require admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to investigate the potential associations of obesity and diabetes with COVID19 severe outcomes, assessed as ICU admittance. Subjects: Demographic and patient characteristics from a retrospective cohort of 1158 patients hospitalized with COVID19 in a single center in Kuwait, along with their medical history, were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations between different variables and ICU admittance. Results: From the 1158 hospitalized patients, 271 (23.4%) had diabetes, 236 (20.4%) had hypertension and 104 (9%) required admittance into the ICU. From patients with available measurements, 157 (21.6%) had body mass index (BMI)[&ge;]25 kg\/m2. Univariate analysis showed that overweight (BMI=25.0~29.9 kg\/m2), obesity class I (BMI=30~34.9 kg\/m2) and morbid obesity (BMI[&ge;]40 kg\/m2) associated with ICU admittance (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 2.45 [1.26~4.74] p value=0.008; OR [95% CI]: 3.51 [1.60~7.69] p value=0.002; and OR [95% CI]: 5.18 [1.50~17.85] p value=0.009], respectively). Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to ICU (OR [95% CI]: 9.38 [5.49~16.02]). Two models for multivariate regression analysis were used, assessing either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I obesity and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance (adjusted OR (AOR) [95% CI]: 2.7 [1.17~6.20] p value=0.019 and AOR [95% CI]: 3.95 [1.00~15.20] p value=0.046, respectively). In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with higher ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 5.49 [3.13~9.65] p value<0.001) whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 0.51 (0.28-0.91). Conclusions: In our cohort, overweight, obesity and diabetes in patients with COVID19 were associated with ICU admittance, putting these patients at higher risk of poor outcomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Salman K.
