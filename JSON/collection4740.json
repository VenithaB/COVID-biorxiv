Early detection is crucial for its effective control. Nucleic acid testing for viral pathogen and serological testing for host antibodies are playing important roles in current COVID-19 diagnosis. However, while nucleic acid testing is complicated, facility-restricted and time-consuming, antibody testing may result in high rates of false-negative diagnoses, especially during the early stages of viral infection. Thus, a more rapid and reliable test for both early COVID-19 diagnosis and whole-population screening is urgently needed. Here, we developed a novel nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and high-sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. Our paper test uses a newly established peroxidase-mimic Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme instead of natural HRP that catalytically amplifies the chemiluminescent signal, allowing for target concentrations to be as low as 0.1 ng\/ml. Furthermore, our nanozyme-based chemiluminescence test exhibits a linear range that is 32-fold wider compared to ELISA tests. Importantly, testing is completed in less than 16 min, compared to 1-2 h required for ELISA or nucleic acid tests. Critically, signal detection is feasible using a smartphone camera. Ingredients for our test are simple and readily available, rendering overall cost considerably lower than those used in current diagnoses. In conclusion, our novel test provides a high-sensitive, point-of-care testing (POCT) approach for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, which should greatly increase current early screening capacities for suspected infections, and considerably lower demand for national healthcare resources.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Liu","author_inst":"CAS Engineering Laboratory for Nanozyme, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chenhui Ju","author_inst":"CAS Engineering Laboratory for Nanozyme, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academic of Science"},{"author_name":"Chao Han","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy o"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuehui Chen","author_inst":"CAS Engineering Laboratory for Nanozyme, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academic of Science"},{"author_name":"Demin Duan","author_inst":"CAS Engineering Laboratory for Nanozyme, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academic of Science"},{"author_name":"Jinghua Yan","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Savaid Medical School, Universi"},{"author_name":"Xiyun Yan","author_inst":"CAS Engineering Laboratory for Nanozyme, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academic of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.135046","rel_title":"An OpenData portal to share COVID-19 drug repurposing data in real time","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.135046","rel_abs":"The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has developed an online open science data portal for its COVID-19 drug repurposing campaign - named OpenData - with the goal of making data across a range of SARS-CoV-2 related assays available in real-time.

In this study, we developed a novel multiplex real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR test for detection of SARS-CoV-2, with primers designed to amplify a 108 bp target on the spike surface glycoprotein (S gene) of SARS-CoV-2 and a hydrolysis Taqman probe designed to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2. Following our design, we evaluated the Limit of detection (LOD) and clinical performance of this laboratory-developed test (LDT). A LOD study with inactivated whole virus exhibited equal performance to that seen in the modified CDC assay with a final LOD of 1,301 \u00b1 13 genome equivalents\/ml for our assay vs 1,249 \u00b1 14 genome equivalents\/ml for the modified CDC assay. In addition, a clinical evaluation with 270 nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens exhibited 98.5% positive percent agreement and 99.3% negative percent agreement with the modified CDC assay. The multiplex design of this assay allows the testing of 91 patients per plate, versus a maximum of 29 patients per plate on the modified CDC assay, providing the benefit of testing significantly more patients per run and saving reagents during a time when both of these parameters have been critical. Our results demonstrate that our multiplex assay performs as well as the modified CDC assay, but is more efficient and cost effective and is therefore adequate for use as a diagnostic assay and for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zhen","author_inst":"Northwell Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Berry","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Richard T Eastman","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Xin Hu","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Ke Wang","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Mark Backus","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Bolormaa Baljinnyam","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z.

Both viruses use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry, recognizing it with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike (S) protein. The S2 domain mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Experience with SARS and MERS coronaviruses has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS) and block the virus cell entry. Assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against SARS-CoV-2, we used phage display to select from the human naive universal antibody gene libraries HAL9\/10 anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction with ACE2. 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1 were identified. 17 showed more than 75% inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2 in the scFv-Fc format, assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50% inhibition at a molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or RBD of 1:1. All 17 scFv-Fc were able to bind the isolated RBD, four of them with sub-nanomolar EC50. Furthermore, these scFv-Fc neutralized active SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. In a final step, the antibodies neutralizing best as scFv-Fc were converted into the IgG format. The antibody STE73-2E9 showed neutralization of active SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 0.43 nM and is binding to the ACE2-RBD interface. Universal libraries from healthy human donors offer the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the availability of material from recovered patients in a pandemic situation.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Federico Bertoglio","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Doris Meier","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Nora Langreder","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Stephan Steinke","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Ulfert Rand","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Luca Simonelli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina, Universita della Svizzera italiana"},{"author_name":"Philip Alexander Heine","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Rico Ballmann","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Kai-Thomas Schneider","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Kristian Daniel Ralph Roth","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Ruschig","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Peggy Riese","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Eschke","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Yeonsu Kim","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Dorina Schaeckermann","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Mattia Pedotti","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina, Universita della Svizzera italiana"},{"author_name":"Philipp Kuhn","author_inst":"YUMAB GmbH"},{"author_name":"Susanne Zock-Emmenthal","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Johannes Woehrle","author_inst":"BioCopy GmbH"},{"author_name":"Normann Kilb","author_inst":"BioCopy GmbH"},{"author_name":"Tobias Herz","author_inst":"BioCopy GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marlies Becker","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Martina Grashoff","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Esther Veronika Wenzel","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Giulio Russo","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Andrea Kroeger","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Linda Brunotte","author_inst":"Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster"},{"author_name":"Stephan Ludwig","author_inst":"Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster"},{"author_name":"Viola Fuehner","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Stefan Daniel Kraemer","author_inst":"BioCopy GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Duebel","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Luca Varani","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina"},{"author_name":"Guenter Roth","author_inst":"BioCopy GmbH"},{"author_name":"Luka Cicin-Sain","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Maren Schubert","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Michael Hust","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Min Shen","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.136481","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute infection with dynamic cellular and inflammatory flux in the lung that varies across nonhuman primate species","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.136481","rel_abs":"There are no known cures or vaccines for COVID-19, the defining pandemic of this era. Animal models are essential to fast track new interventions and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of other infectious diseases have proven extremely valuable. Here we compare SARS-CoV-2 infection in three species of experimentally infected NHPs (rhesus macaques, baboons, and marmosets). During the first 3 days, macaques developed clinical signatures of viral infection and systemic inflammation, coupled with early evidence of viral replication and mild-to-moderate interstitial and alveolar pneumonitis, as well as extra-pulmonary pathologies. Cone-beam CT scans showed evidence of moderate pneumonia, which progressed over 3 days. Longitudinal studies showed that while both young and old macaques developed early signs of COVID-19, both groups recovered within a two-week period. Recovery was characterized by low-levels of viral persistence in the lung, suggesting mechanisms by which individuals with compromised immune systems may be susceptible to prolonged and progressive COVID-19. The lung compartment contained a complex early inflammatory milieu with an influx of innate and adaptive immune cells, particularly interstitial macrophages, neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and a prominent Type I-interferon response. While macaques developed moderate disease, baboons exhibited prolonged shedding of virus and extensive pathology following infection; and marmosets demonstrated a milder form of infection. These results showcase in critical detail, the robust early cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are not sterilizing and likely impact development of antibody responses. Thus, various NHP genera recapitulate heterogeneous progression of COVID-19. Rhesus macaques and baboons develop different, quantifiable disease attributes making them immediately available essential models to test new vaccines and therapies.","rel_num_authors":58,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhiraj K.

NSP3 and NSP5 of SARS-CoV (SARS1) are known interferon antagonists. Here, we examined whether the protease function of SARS2 NSP3 and NSP5 target proteins involved in the host innate immune response. We designed a fluorescent based cleavage assay to rapidly screen the protease activity of NSP3 and NSP5 on a library of 71 human innate immune proteins (HIIPs), covering most pathways involved in human innate immunity. By expressing each of these HIIPs with a genetically encoded fluorophore in a cell-free system and titrating in the recombinant protease domain of NSP3 or NSP5, we could readily detect cleavage of cognate HIIPs on SDS-page gels. We identified 3 proteins that were specifically and selectively cleaved by NSP3 or NSP5: IRF-3, and NLRP12 and TAB1, respectively. Direct cleavage of IRF3 by NSP3 could explain the blunted Type- I IFN response seen during SARS-CoV-2 infections while NSP5 mediated cleavage of NLRP12 and TAB1 point to a molecular mechanism for enhanced production of IL-6 and inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, both NLRP12 and TAB1 have each two distinct cleavage sites. We demonstrate that in mice, the second cleavage site of NLRP12 is absent. We pushed this comparative alignment of IRF-3 and NLRP12 homologs and show that the lack or presence of cognate cleavage motifs in IRF-3 and NLRP12 could contribute to the presentation of disease in cats and tigers, for example. Our findings provide an explanatory framework for in-depth studies into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and should facilitate the search or development of more effective animal models for severe COVID-19. Finally, we discovered that one particular species of bats, Davids Myotis, possesses the five cleavage sites found in humans for NLRP12, TAB1 and IRF3. These bats are endemic from the Hubei province in China and we discuss its potential role as reservoir for the evolution of SARS1 and SASR2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehdi Moustaqil","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Emma Ollivier","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Hsin-Ping Chiu","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Paulina Rudolffi-Soto","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Sarah Van Tol","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Christian Stevens","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

Early research has suggested that pre-existing fatty liver disease may be a significant risk factor for hospitalisation. Liver fat, in particular, is a modifiable parameter and can be a target for public health policy and individual patient plans. In this study we aimed to assess pre-existing liver disease as a risk factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19. Methods From 502,506 participants from the UK Biobank, 42,146 underwent MRI (aged 45-82), and had measures of liver fat, liver fibroinflammatory disease and liver iron. Patients were censored on May 28th to determine how many had tested for COVID-19 with symptomatic disease. UK testing was restricted to those with symptoms in hospital. COVID-19 symptoms included fever, dry cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and fatigue. Univariate analysis was performed on liver phenotypic biomarkers to determine if these variables increased risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and compared to previously described risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including to age, ethnicity, gender and obesity, Findings Increased liver fat was associated with a higher risk for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 in this population in univariate analysis(OR:1.85, p=0.03). In obese participants, only those with concomitant fatty liver([&ge;]10%) were at increased risk(OR:2.96, p=0.02), with those having normal liver fat (<5%) showing no increased risk(OR:0.36, p=0.09). Conclusions UK Biobank data demonstrated an association between pre-existing liver disease and obesity with severe COVID-19, with higher proportions of liver fat in obese individuals a likely risk factor for symptomatic disease and severity. Public policy measures to protect patients with liver disease who may have almost double the risk of the general population should be considered, especially as dietary and pharmacological strategies to reduce body weight and liver fat already exist.

G-quadruplex, one of the non-canonical secondary structures, has shown potential antiviral values. However, little is known about G-quadruplexes on the emerging SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we characterized the potential G-quadruplexes both in the positive and negative-sense viral stands. The identified potential G-quadruplexes exhibits similar features to the G-quadruplexes detected in the human transcriptome. Within some bat and pangolin related beta coronaviruses, the G-quartets rather than the loops are under heightened selective constraints. We also found that the SUD-like sequence is retained in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, while some other coronaviruses that can infect humans are depleted. Further analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 SUD-like sequence is almost conserved among 16,466 SARS-CoV-2 samples. And the SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like dimer displayed similar electrostatic potential pattern to the SUD dimer. Considering the potential value of G-quadruplexes to serve as targets in antiviral strategy, we hope our fundamental research could provide new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongxin Zhang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Ke Xiao","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Hongde Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Sun","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Rajarshi Banerjee","author_inst":"Perspectum Ltd"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

To do this, we examined the frequency of once ordinary, but newly risky behavior (as deemed by CDC guidelines) in a sample of 482 MTurkers. We ran analyses probing the situational and dispositional variables that predicted variance in risky behavior using data-driven and hypothesis-generated approaches. We found situational and dispositional variables contributed unique variance to risky behavior, controlling for variability accounted for by demographic factors. More frequent report of risky activity was associated with higher extraversion, need for cognitive closure, behavior activation, and perceived resource scarcity; in contrast, more frequent report of risky activity was associated with less empathy and living space access, as well as younger age. To break down these findings, we used a cluster analysis to profile individuals, using only situational and dispositional variables belonging to seven clusters. Combined with testing differences in risk taking by cluster identity, we suggest this profile approach might allow consideration of multi-faceted attributes that influence adherence with public health guidance in the context of health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongxin Zhang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Ke Xiao","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Hongde Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Sun","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Rajarshi Banerjee","author_inst":"Perspectum Ltd"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic, the question emerges whether human-to-animal transmission is possible and if so, which animal species are most at risk. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o PGLM Rodrigues","author_inst":"Department of Structural Biology - Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Susana Barrera-Vilarmau","author_inst":"Institute of Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia (IQAC) - CSIC"},{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o MC Teixeira","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Seckel","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis L Kastritis","author_inst":"ZIK HALOMEM & Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg"},{"author_name":"Michael Levitt","author_inst":"Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

Additionally, the isolation that results from social distancing may be harming well-being for families, as formal and informal supports become less accessible. For those with living with dementia and experiencing agitation, social distancing may be even harder to maintain, or social distancing could potentially aggravate dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. To understand the lived experience of social and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada we remotely interviewed 21 participants who normally attend a dementia specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, during a period where essential businesses were closed and healthcare had abruptly transitioned to telemedicine. The impacts of the public health measures in response to the pandemic emerged in three main categories of experience: 1) personal; 2) health services; and 3) health status (of both person living with dementia and care partner). This in-depth understanding of the needs and experiences of the pandemic for people living with dementia suggests that innovative means are urgently needed to facilitate provision of remote medicine and also social interaction and integration.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pamela Roach","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Angela Zwiers","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Emily Cox","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Karyn Fischer","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Anna Charlton","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Colin B Josephson","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Scott B Patten","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Dallas Seitz","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Zahinoor Ismail","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Eric E Smith","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"- Prompt Collaborators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Emma Sierecki","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Yann Gambin","author_inst":"EMBL Australia, The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Results: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-white. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%) and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (>70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p<0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p<0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22\/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. Conclusions: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcome in future outbreaks of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Oliver Van Oekelen","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Tarek Mouhieddine","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diane Marie Del Valle","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Joshua Richter","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Hearn Jay Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Shambavi Richard","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

It has been proposed that lockdown conditions disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain, requiring adaptation to treatment and care strategies. We investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N=431) relative to a healthy control group (N=88) using an online survey. In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised increases in perceived pain and psychological distress that would be mediated by pain catastrophizing. Survey questions answered during the lockdown period, probing patients self-perceived changes retrospectively, revealed that people with chronic pain perceived increases in their pain severity compared to before lockdown. They were also more adversely affected by lockdown compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise. Pain catastrophizing was found to be an important factor in predicting the extent of self-perceived increases in pain, and accounted for the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also independently predicted perceptions of increased pain. Interestingly, actual changes in pain symptoms (measured at two time points at pre- and post-lockdown in a subgroup, N = 85) did not change significantly on average, but those reporting increases also demonstrated greater baseline levels of pain catastrophizing. Overall, the findings suggest that remote pain management provision to target reduction of catastrophizing and increases to physical activity could be beneficial for chronic pain patients in overcoming the adverse effects of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Fallon","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Christopher Brown","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Hannah Twiddy","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Brian","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Frank","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Turo Nurmikko","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrej Stancak","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

The consequences of this rapid dispersion are under investigation. In this work, we analyzed thousands of genomes and protein sequences from Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. We show that the virus is a complex of slightly different variants that are unevenly distributed on Earth, and demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is spatially structured. Remarkably, the virus phylogeographic patterns were associated with ancestral amino acidic mutations. We hypothesize that geographic structuring is the result of founder effects occurring as a consequence of, and local evolution occurring after, long-distance dispersal. Based on previous studies, the possibility that this could significantly affect the virus phenotype is not remote.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leandro R.

Mortality rates from COVID by age, sex and ethnicity were used to attribute risk to GPs and the Index of Multiple Deprivation was used to determine socioeconomic distributions of the outcomes. Results: Of 45,858 GPs in our sample 3,632 (7.9%) were classified as high risk or very high risk. Of 6,771 GP practices in our sample 639 (9.4%) were identified as single-handed practices and of these 209 (32.7%) were run by a GP at high or very high risk. These 209 single-handed practices care for 710,043 patients. GPs at the highest levels of risk from COVID, and single-handed practices run by high-risk GPs were concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country. London had the highest proportion of both GPs and single-handed GP practices at very high risk of COVID mortality with 1,160 patients per 100,000 population registered to these practices. Conclusions: A significant proportion of GPs working in England, particularly those serving patients in the most deprived neighbourhoods, are at high risk of dying from COVID. Many of these GPs run single-handed practices. These GPs are particularly concentrated in London. There is an opportunity to provide additional support to mitigate COVID risk for GPs, GP practices and their patients. Failure to do so will likely exacerbate existing health inequalities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miqdad Asaria","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Fisher","author_inst":"The Health Foundation"},{"author_name":"Hannah Twiddy","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Brian","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Frank","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Turo Nurmikko","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrej Stancak","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

A great concern around the globe now is to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic via contact tracing. Analyzing the control strategies during the first five months of 2020 in Singapore is important to estimate the effectiveness of contacting tracing measures. Methods. We developed a mathematical model to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in Singapore, with local cases stratified into 5 categories according to the conditions of contact tracing and self-awareness. Key parameters of each category were estimated from local surveillance data. We also simulated a set of possible scenarios to predict the effects of contact tracing and self-awareness for the following month. Findings. During January 23 - March 16, 2020, the success probabilities of contact tracing and self-awareness were estimated to be 31% (95% CI 28%-33%) and 54% (95% CI 51%-57%), respectively. During March 17 - April 7, 2020, several social distancing measures (e.g., limiting mass gathering) were introduced in Singapore, which, however, were estimated with minor contribution to reduce the non-tracing reproduction number per local case (R_(l,2)). If contact tracing and self-awareness cannot be further improved, we predict that the COVID-19 epidemic will continue to spread in Singapore if R_(l,2)[&ge;]1.5. Conclusion. Contact tracing and self-awareness can mitigate the COVID-19 transmission, and can be one of the key strategies to ensure a sustainable reopening after lifting the lockdown.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiuyang Huang","author_inst":"College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Yongjian Yang","author_inst":"College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China"},{"author_name":"Liping Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technology University, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Gaoxi Xiao","author_inst":"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technology University, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Andrej Stancak","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

Methods: We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. Results: The majority of Covid-19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non-diabetics. Conclusions: Severe Covid-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid-19 suggests a previously unrecognized manifestation of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Smith","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppana","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Julie A Traupman","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Enrique Unson","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Daniel A Maddock","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Kathy Y Chao","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"David P Dobesh","author_inst":"Saint Barnabas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ruth I Connor","author_inst":"Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

The potential biological benefits of ozonated autohemotherapy include reduced tissue hypoxia, decreased hypercoagulability, modulated immune function with inhibition of inflammatory mediators, improved phagocytic function, and impaired viral replication. Objective: To determine the impact of the use of ozonated blood on time to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: A Quasi-Randomized Controlled Trial determined by admittance to the hospital based on bed availability. Setting: Internal Medicine ward at Policlinica Ibiza Hospital, Spain. Participants: Eighteen patients with COVID-19 infection (laboratory confirmed) severe pneumonia admitted to hospital between 20th March and 19th April 2020. The mean age of the cohort was 68 years-old and 72% (n=13) were male. Intervention: Patients admitted to the hospital during the study period were pre-randomized to different beds based on bed availability. Depending on the bed the patient was admitted, the treatment was ozone autohemotherapy or standard treatment. Patients in the therapy arm received ozonated blood twice daily starting on the day of admission for a median of four days. Each treatment involved administration of 200 mL autologous whole blood enriched with 200 mL of oxygen-ozone mixture with a 40 g\/mL ozone concentration. Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was time from hospital admission to clinical improvement, which was defined as either hospital discharge or a two-point improvement in clinical status measured on a six-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were clinical improvement measured on the 7th, 14th and 28th day after admission, as well as time to a two-fold reduction in concentrations of C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. Results: Nine patients (50%) received ozonated autohemotherapy beginning on the day of admission. Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement (median [IQR]), 7 days [6-10] vs 28 days [8-31], p=0.04) and better outcomes at 14-days (88.8% vs 33.3%, p=0.01). In risk-adjusted analyses, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a shorter mean time to clinical improvement (-11.3 days, p=0.04, 95% CI -22.25 to -0.42). Conclusion: Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a significantly shorter time to clinical improvement in this quasi-randomized controlled trial. Given the small sample size and study design, these results require evaluation in larger randomized controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ALBERTO HERNANDEZ","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"MONTSERRAT VINALS","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"ASUNCION PABLOS","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"FRANCISCO VILAS","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"PETER J PAPADAKOS","author_inst":"University of Rochester, NY"},{"author_name":"DUMINDA N WIJEYSUNDERA","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital, Toronto"},{"author_name":"SERGIO BERGESE","author_inst":"Stony Brook University, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"MARC VIVES","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Dr. J Trueta de Girona"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

Objectives: We estimated the association between patients characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome in Mexico. Methods: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalization and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalization and adverse outcome. Results: Overall, 236,439 patients were included, with 89,756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalized and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalization and adverse outcome.

We also studied if the predictive power of these variables changed during a 4 months period (March, April, May and June). We approached data in two different ways, cumulative data and non-cumulative data. The number of deaths by Covid-19 can always be predicted with great accuracy from the number of infected, regardless of the characteristics of the country. Inbound tourism emerged as the variable that best predicts the number of infected (and, consequently, the number of deaths) happening in the different countries. Electricity consumption and air pollution of a country (CO2 emissions, nitrous oxide and methane) are also capable of predicting, with great precision, the number of infections and deaths from Covid-19. Characteristics such as the area and population of a country can also predict, although to a lesser extent, the number of infected and dead. All predictive variables remained significant through time. In contrast, a series of variables, which in principle would seem to have a greater influence on the evolution of Covid-19 (hospital bed density, Physicians per 1000 people, Researches in R & D, urban population, etc.), turned out to have very little -or none- predictive power. Our results explain why countries that opted for travel restrictions and social withdrawal policies at a very early stage of the pandemic outbreak, obtained better results. Preventive policies proved to be the key, rather than having large hospital and medical resources.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Garcia Garcia de Alcaniz","author_inst":"Veterinary Faculty Complutense University Madrid Genetics Department"},{"author_name":"Julia Romero-Lopez","author_inst":"Veterinary Faculty Complutense University Madrid Genetics Department"},{"author_name":"Rocio P.

The world wide burden of the disease has been massive, and the governments are in dilemma to protect the health system of the country while safeguarding the economy. There is no vaccine or antivirus drug found against this virus while multiple research groups are actively working on a suitable candidate. The only available mode of minimizing the disease burden has been to control its transmission among the population. Since the occurrence of first COVID 19 local case on 11 March 2020, the government of Sri Lanka introduced serious social distancing and public health interventions in its fullest capacity as a developing nation to effectively combat with the disease spread. This study focuses to develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of this novel disease using an extended version of an SEIR compartmental structure considering the heterogeneity of cases such as asymptomatic, symptomatic with mild indications and the cases required intensive care treatments. All the measures and interventions are in progress with a significantly large social and economic cost, thus, optimal control techniques are used to identify the most appropriate strategies to minimize this cost. The results of the simulations prove that optimal control measures can be worked out as the epidemic curves are flattened while delaying the outbreak so that the health system might not be under pressure to treat and care the patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tharindu Wickramaarachchi Sr.","author_inst":"The Open University of sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Sanjeewa Perera Sr.","author_inst":"University of Colombo"},{"author_name":"Rocio P.

The first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by the contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and quickly turned into a pandemic. In Brazil, the first case occurred on January 23rd, 2020 but was officially reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health on February 25th. Since then, the number of deaths and people infected by COVID-19 in Brazil have been steadily increasing. Despite the underreporting of coronavirus cases by government agencies across the country, the State of Sao Paulo has the highest rate among all Brazilian States. Thus, it is essential to detect which areas contain the highest concentration of COVID-19 to implement public policies, to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. To identify these critical areas, we utilized daily confirmed case data from the Brasil.IO website between February 25th, 2020 to May 5th, 2020; which were aggregated to the municipality level. A prospective space-time scan statistic was applied to evaluate possible active clusters in three different time periods. The results visualize the space-time evolution and dynamics of COVID-19 clusters in the State of Sao Paulo. Since the first study period, the results highlight approximately 4.6 times the number of municipalities belonging to a significant cluster with a RR>1 on May 5th. These results can inform health authorities and public management to take the necessary measures to minimize the transmission of COVID-19 and track the evolution of significant space-time clusters.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Vicente Ferreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro"},{"author_name":"Marcos R Martines","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Rogerio H Toppa","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Luiza M Assuncao","author_inst":"State University of Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Michael Richard Desjardins","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eric M Delmelle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"John R Lamb","author_inst":"GNF Novartis, 10675 John Jay Hopkins Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA"},{"author_name":"Valborg Gudmundsdottir","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Lori L Jennings","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, 22 Windsor Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA"},{"author_name":"Vilmundur Gudnason","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

The filtering efficiency of these masks were tested before and after sterilisation using gamma radiation for the two flow rate conditions corresponding normal breath rate (20lpm) and during sneezing\/coughing (90lpm).Sterilisation is carried out using a gamma irradiator containing Co-60 source for the two dose exposures viz. 15kGy and 25kGy. The filtering efficiency for surgical (non-woven fabric) and double layer cotton cloth mask is found to vary from 18% to 22% for the cumulative particle of size [&ge;] 0.3 micron in both un-irradiated and irradiated condition. The filtration efficiency of N95 mask is found to be reduced to 70% for the most penetrating particle size (0.3 micron) with the flow rate of 20lpm and further reduced for particles in the range of 0.1 and 0.2 micron with flow rate of 90 lpm. The reduction in efficiency after gamma sterilization is associated with reduction of electrostatic interaction of filter medium with particles laden in the air stream. Even with reduced filtering efficiency due to gamma sterilisation, the N95 masks are much superior than the surgical and cloth masks. Instead of disposing N95 mask after single use, they can be reused a few times as N70 mask during this pandemic crisis after sterilisation using gamma radiation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amit Kumar","author_inst":"Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research"},{"author_name":"D.

Group testing proposed by Technion [1][2] could improve efficiency greatly. However, the false negative rate (FNR) would be doubled. Using USA as an example, group testing would have over 70,000 false negatives, compared to 35,000 false negatives by individual testing. In this paper, we propose a Flexible, Accurate and Speedy Test (FAST), which is faster and more accurate than any existing tests. FAST first forms small close contact subgroups, e.g. families and friends. It then pools subgroups to form larger groups before RT-PCR test is done. FAST needs a similar number of tests to Technion's method, but sharply reduces the FNR to a negligible level. For example, FAST brings down the number of false negatives in USA to just 2000, and it is seven times faster than individual testing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linjiajie Fang","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shen Ling","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Bing-Yi Jing","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qing Yang","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"V.

If confirmed, this has important implications for the more than 1.62 billion people estimated to have anemia globally. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate biomarkers of anemia and iron metabolism (hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, haptoglobin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, erythropoietin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrine, and prevalence of anemia) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and explore their prognostic value. Six bibliographic databases were searched up to May 5th 2020. We included 56 unique studies, with data from 14,044 COVID-19 patients (59 years median age). Pooled mean hemoglobin and ferritin levels in COVID-19 patients across all ages were 130.41 g\/L (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 128.42; 132.39) and 673.91 ng\/mL (95% CI, 420.98; 926.84), respectively. Hemoglobin levels decreased with advancing age and increasing percentage of comorbid and critically ill patients, while levels of ferritin increased with increasing male proportion and mean hemoglobin levels. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases had lower pooled mean hemoglobin [weighted mean difference (WMD), -4.21 (95% CI -6.63; -1.78)] and higher ferritin [WMD, -730.55 ng\/mL (95% CI 413.24; 1047.85)]. A significant difference in mean ferritin level of 1027.23 ng\/mL (95% CI 819.53; 1234.94) was found between survivors and non-survivors, but not in hemoglobin levels. No studies provided information on anemia or other biomarkers of interest. Future studies should explore the impact of iron metabolism and anemia and in the pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Petek Eylul Taneri","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alejandro Gomez-Ochoa","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Foundation of Colombia"},{"author_name":"Erand Llanaj","author_inst":"University of Debrecen Public Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Peter Francis Raguindin","author_inst":"University of Bern Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lydia Z.

We present here an analysis of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, and explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number R0 to a target value R0target < 1, but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target R0target < 1, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests\/day to the number of new cases\/day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts of an infectious person, which would be high in densely populated regions with low levels of SD. We point out that, apart from R0, an important quantity is the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics which provides a more complete understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. Weak intervention strategies (that reduce R0 but not to a value less than 1) can reduce the peak values of infections and the asymptotic affected population. We provide simple analytic expressions for these in terms of the disease parameters and apply them in the Indian context to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic. We find that the predictions strongly depend on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arghya Das","author_inst":"International centre for theoretical sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Dhar","author_inst":"International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Anupam Kundu","author_inst":"International centre for theoretical sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Srashti Goyal","author_inst":"International centre for theoretical sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Lydia Z.
