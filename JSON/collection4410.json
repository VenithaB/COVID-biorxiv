A major risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19 infection is the presence of advance age, co-morbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity among other non-communicable diseases2. Epidemiological data from high-prevalence countries reveal that compared to men, women are less likely to die or to require hospital admission to intensive care. This may suggest that pregnant women are not more susceptible to infection or to experience serious complications. However, whether the presence of co-morbidities or advanced maternal age confers a higher risk of adverse outcome in pregnant women with COVID-19 is unknown3. In this research letter, we aimed at evaluating the risk factor associated with maternal mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection in a middle-income country. Advanced maternal age is linked to an increased risk of mortality, while diabetes is the most important risk factor for maternal death. This is partly explained by an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases in women of advanced age which is a common feature in most countries4. In the last decades, low- and middle-income countries have experienced accelerated socio-cultural changes associated with its incorporation into the international economic community, which have increased the number of obese and diabetic population, including pregnant women5. This has caused an increased risk for complications and fatality among COVID-19 positive population2,3. Thus, policies for reducing obesity and diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are most needed to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 in pregnant women.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raigam Jafet Martinez-Portilla","author_inst":"University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alexadros Sotiriadis","author_inst":"Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"},{"author_name":"Johnatan Torres-Torres","author_inst":"Hospital General de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Charzakis Christos","author_inst":"Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"},{"author_name":"Ameth Hawkins-Villarreal","author_inst":"University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Rafael Villafan-Bernal","author_inst":"Catedras CONACYT, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica"},{"author_name":"Rodolfo A Gurrola-Ochoa","author_inst":"Iberoamerican Research Network"},{"author_name":"Francesc Figueras","author_inst":"University of Barcelona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20112748","rel_title":"COVID-19 Hospitalization is More Frequent and Severe in Down Syndrome","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20112748","rel_abs":"Background. Individuals with rare disorders, like Down syndrome (DS) are historically understudied. Currently, it is not known how COVID-19 pandemic affects individuals with DS. Herein, we report an analysis of individuals with DS who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, USA. Methods. In this retrospective, single-center study of 4,615 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we analyzed all patients with DS admitted in the Mount Sinai Health System. Hospitalization rates, clinical and outcomes were assessed. Findings. Contrary to an expected number of one, we identified six patients with DS. We found that patients with DS are at an 8.9-fold higher risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 when compared to non-DS patients. Hospitalized DS individuals are on average 10 years younger than non-DS patients with COVID-19. Moreover, type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to be an important driver of this susceptibility to COVID-19. Finally, patients with DS have more severe outcomes than controls, and are more likely to progress to sepsis in particular. Interpretation. We demonstrate that individuals with DS represent a higher risk population for COVID-19 compared to the general population and conclude that particular care should be taken for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in these patients.

Inflammation is central to the aetiology of both conditions where variations in immune responses have the potential to mitigate or aggravate disease course. Identifying at risk groups based on immuno-inflammatory signatures is valuable in directing personalised care and developing potential targets for precision therapy. Methods: This study characterised immunophenotypic variation associated with COVID-19 severity in type 2 diabetes. Broad-spectrum immunophenotyping quantified 15 leukocyte populations in peripheral circulation from a cohort of 45 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Results: Morphological anomalies in the monocyte pool, monocytopenia specific to quiescent monocytes, and a decreased frequency of cytotoxic lymphocytes were associated with severe COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes requiring intensive care. An aggravated inflammatory gene expression profile, reminiscent of the type-1 interferon pathway, underlaid the immunophenotype associated with severe disease in T2D. Conclusion: Shifts in T-cell and monocyte dynamics underpin a maladaptive response to SARS-CoV-2. These alterations may impact type-1 interferon signalling which is the likely source of the hyperinflammation that increases voracity of COVID-19. These findings allow the identification of type 2 diabetic patients at risk of severe disease as well as providing evidence that the type-1 interferon pathway may be an actionable therapeutic target for future studies.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fawaz ALZAID","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Cordeliers Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Jean-Baptiste Julla","author_inst":"INSERM CRC \/ Hopital Lariboisiere - APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Diedisheim","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC \/ Hopital Cochin"},{"author_name":"Charline Potier","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Louis Potier","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat - APHP"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Velho","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Benedicte Gaborit","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University, INSERM, INRA, C2VN, Marseille, France.

However, hand washing must be perpetuated properly using soap and water for at least 20 seconds. In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, various hospitals have imposed mandatory hand washing to everyone prior entering the facilities, and when leaving. This study aimed to assess the hand washing compliance among visitors of a university referral hospital. Methods: A non-participatory observational study was conducted in the main entrance of the hospital from April 27 to May 3, 2020, to measure hand washing compliance of its visitors. The quality of hand washing was assessed via direct observation for compliance with the recommended World Health Organization (WHO) core steps. Data were collected using Open Data Kit (ODK) mobile application. Results: A total of 1,282 hospital visitors were observed, of which 874(68.2%) were males. Full hand washing compliances were observed among 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4-1.4) of the visitors. Withal, there was no difference in the compliances between genders (0.9% vs 0.7%, P = 0.745). Conclusion: Despite the fact that proper hand washing with soap and water is proven to be one of the effective ways in preventing the spread of COVID-19, a significant number of hospital visitors did not practice standard hand washing procedures. Improvements in this measure are urgently needed in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biniyam Sahiledengle","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Yohannes Tekalegn","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Abulie Takele","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Demisu Zenbab","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Zinash Teferu","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Alelign Tasew","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Public Health, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tesfaye Assefa","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Nursing, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kebebe Bekele","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Surgery, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Abdi Abdi","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Surgery, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Habtamu Gezahegn","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Physiology, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tadesse Awoke","author_inst":"University of Gondar, Colleague of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Gondar, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Bruce John Edward Quisido","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Nursing, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Elise Dalmas","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Venteclef","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes, Clinical Investigation Centre (CIC-9504), Lariboisiere Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20113209","rel_title":"Applying Heat and Humidity using Stove Boiled Water for Decontamination of N95 Respirators in Low Resource Settings","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20113209","rel_abs":"Global shortages of N95 respirators have led to an urgent need of N95 decontamination and reuse methods that are scientifically validated and available world-wide. Although several large scale decontamination methods have been proposed (hydrogen peroxide vapor, UV-C); many of them are not applicable in remote and low-resource settings. Heat with humidity has been demonstrated as a promising decontamination approach, but care must be taken when implementing this method at a grassroots level. Here we present a simple, scalable method to provide controlled humidity and temperature for individual N95 respirators which is easily applicable in low-resource settings. N95 respirators were subjected to moist heat (>50% relative humidity, 65-80C temperature) for over 30 minutes by placing them in a sealed container immersed in water that had been brought to a rolling boil and removed from heat, and then allowing the containers to sit for over 45 minutes. Filtration efficiency of 0.3-4.99um incense particles remained above 97% after 5 treatment cycles across all particle size sub-ranges. This method was then repeated at a higher ambient temperature and humidity in Mumbai, using standard utensils commonly found in South Asia. Similar temperatures and humidities were achieved and filtration efficiencies consistently remained above 94%. Higher temperatures (>70C) and longer treatment times (>40 minutes) were obtained by insulating the outer vessel. This simple yet reliable method can be performed even without electricity access using any heat source to boil water, from open-flame stoves to solar heating, and provides a low-cost route for N95 decontamination globally applicable in resource-constrained settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siddharth Doshi","author_inst":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Samhita P.

In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 minutes, but its accuracy for the detection of COVID-19 is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of PCR, and stratified by duration of symptoms. A multivariable predictive model was developed and underwent internal validation. Results FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110\/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112\/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.73 (95%CI 4.37 to 10.37) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.15) respectively. In the multivariate model diagnosis of COVID-19 was not significantly influenced by clinical symptoms and signs, and FebriDx accuracy was not improved by restricting testing to those with duration of symptoms of less than seven days. Conclusions During the first wave of the pandemic, FebriDx had high sensitivity for the identification of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and could be deployed as a front door triage tool.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tristan William Clark","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Nathan James Brendish","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Stephen Poole","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Vasanth V Naidu","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mansbridge","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Norton","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Wheeler","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Laura Presland","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sean Ewings","author_inst":"Southampton Clinical Trials Unit, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Habtamu Gezahegn","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Physiology, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tadesse Awoke","author_inst":"University of Gondar, Colleague of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Gondar, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Bruce John Edward Quisido","author_inst":"Madda Walabu University Goba Referral hospital, Department of Nursing, Bale-Goba, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Elise Dalmas","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Venteclef","author_inst":"INSERM-CRC"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes, Clinical Investigation Centre (CIC-9504), Lariboisiere Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20115048","rel_title":"Correlation of the global spread of coronavirus disease-19 with atmospheric air temperature","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20115048","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus that may be sensitive to heat.

In the absence of a standard of care, early diagnosis and opt-in therapy with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were offered. Methods: We reviewed records of COVID-19 pneumonia patients from March 16-April 26 2020. Based on NEWS score, we stratified patients as A: low B: medium, and C: high clinical severity and obtained pharmacotherapy data. Chest-CT-severity-score (CTSS) was used. We defined clinical cure as resolution of symptoms and biomarkers and virologic cure as a PCR above 35 cycles(Ct). Results: We recorded 21 COVID-19 pneumonia patients of whom 19 opted for treatment. Clinical symptoms and laboratory markers at presentation did not significantly correlate with severity. Lower initial viral load significantly correlated with lower levels of clinical and radiological severity (p=0.038). Virologic cure, Ct>35, by day 10, was only 33% in high severity significantly less than categories A and B. We observed 100% clinical cure at day 10 in Category-A, 67% in B, and 33% in C(p<0.05). Patients with the lowest severity had the fastest virologic cure in a mean of 5.8 days from diagnosis, shortest hospitalization and earlier radiological improvement(p<0.005). Ultimately, 18 patients were discharged home in good condition and one remains in the ICU. Conclusion: Viral dynamics matter in COVID-19 pneumonia. An early control of replication may be crucial in averting complications.

DESIGN Open-label controlled study SETTING A designated hospital for patients with refractory COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS 27 hospitalized adult patients ([&ge;]18 years of age) with radiologically confirmed pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 positive for more than 28 days despite standard care were assigned to receive standard of care (SOC, grp I) or leflunomide + SOC (grp 2). After 2 weeks, grp 1 and grp 2 patients who continued to be SARS-CoV-2-positive received leflunomide for 14 days while continuing SOC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes were the rate of and time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the 14-day and 30-day hospital discharge rate. RESULTS Twelve patients enrolled in grp 1 and 15 patients were in grp 2. The 14 days SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance rate was 80.0% (12\/15) for grp 2 patients receiving leflunomide versus 16.7% for grp 1 patients (2\/12) (P=0.002). By day 14, the median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance was 6.0 days (range 1-12; IQR 1-12) for grp 2 patients. In grp 1, two patients converted to viral negative on days 1 and 6 (P=0.002). The 14-day discharge rate was 73.3% (11\/15) for the grp 2 versus 8.3% (1\/12) for grp 1 (P=0.001). The 30-day discharge rate was 100% (15\/15) for the grp 2 versus 66.7% (8\/12) for grp 1. No severe adverse events or deaths were reported. CONCLUSION Leflunomide is effective in enhancing SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital discharge in refractory COVID-19 patients. The addition of leflunomide to SOC did not increase adverse events versus SOC. These preliminary observations underscore a need for a randomized clinical study of leflunomide in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Guo","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yu Li","author_inst":"Department of Respirology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xiangdong Jian","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xinguo Hou","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Ning Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Jianchun Fei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Dezhen Su","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhouyan Bian","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respirology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Hu","author_inst":"Department of Quality control, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Sun","author_inst":"Department of Nephropathy, Shandong Provincial Third Hospital Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xueyan Yu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Bei Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119602","rel_title":"High seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 among household members of essential workers detected using a dried blood spot assay","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119602","rel_abs":"Objective: Serological testing is needed to investigate the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from front-line essential workers to their household members. However, the requirement for serum\/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of finger stick capillary whole blood, collected in the home and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). Methods: An ELISA to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized to quantify IgG antibodies in DBS. Samples were self-collected from a community sample of 232 participants enriched with health care workers, including 30 known COVID-19 cases and their household members. Results: Among 30 individuals sharing a household with a virus-confirmed case of COVID-19, 80% were seropositive. Of 202 community individuals without prior confirmed acute COVID-19 diagnoses, 36% were seropositive. Of documented convalescent COVID-19 cases from the community, 29 of 30 (97%) were seropositive for IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain. Conclusion: DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection. Early analysis suggests a high rate of transmission among household members. High rates of seroconversion were also noted following recovery from infection. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples can facilitate seroprevalence assessment in community settings to address epidemiological questions, monitor duration of antibody responses, and assess if antibodies against the spike protein correlate with protection from reinfection.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas W McDade","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth McNally","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Aaron Zelikovich","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Richard D'Aquila","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Brian Mustanski","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Aaron Miller","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Vaught","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nina Reiser","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Elena Bogdanovic","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Fallon","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Alexis Demonbreun","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Yan Sun","author_inst":"Department of Nephropathy, Shandong Provincial Third Hospital Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xueyan Yu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Bei Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20119875","rel_title":"Rapid and accurate detection of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-Cas3","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20119875","rel_abs":"Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have rapidly spread to multiple countries, highlighting the urgent necessity for fast, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tools for virus surveillance.

Furthermore, to examine differences in demographics, clinical signs, and biomarkers in patients tested either positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN Prospective cohort study including patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. SETTING Copenhagen University Hospital Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS 407 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 were included from the Emergency Department (ED). Patients were included from March 19 to April 3 and follow-up data was collected until April 17, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 and in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. Furthermore, we analysed differences between patients testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, and disease severity outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients according to baseline suPAR. BACKGROUND Patients admitted to ED with clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection need a safe and quick triage, in order to determine if an in-hospital stay is necessary or if the patient can safely be isolated in their own home with relevant precautions. suPAR is a biomarker previously shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in acute medical patients. We aimed to examine if suPAR at baseline presentation is predictive of respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, we examined demographic, clinical, and biochemical differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative patients. RESULTS Among the 407 symptomatic patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 years (47-77), 58% were women, and median suPAR was 4.2 ng\/ml (2.7-6.4). suPAR level below 4.75 ng\/ml at admission ruled out respiratory failure during follow-up with an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and a negative predictive value of 99.5%. Of the 407 symptomatic patients, 117 (28.8%) had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with significant differences in vital signs, cell counts, and biomarkers compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. In SARS-CoV-2 positive patients eligible for mechanical ventilation (N=87), 26 (30%) developed respiratory failure. Best baseline predictors of respiratory failure were suPAR with an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.88 (0.80-0.95), EWS 0.84 (0.75-0.93), lactate dehydrogenase 0.82 (0.71-0.93), and C-reactive protein 0.80 (0.70-0.89). CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 affects several patient parameters underpinning the severe impact of the infection. A low suPAR level (<4.75 ng\/ml) at baseline is a useful biomarker for aiding clinical decisions including discharge of patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"jesper eugen-olsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Izzet Altintas","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jens Tingleff","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Marius Stauning","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Hejdi Gamst-Jensen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Mette Bendz Lindstroem","author_inst":"Copenhage University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Line Jee Hartmann Rasmussen","author_inst":"Duke University, USA"},{"author_name":"Klaus Tjelle Kristiansen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Christian Rasmussen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jan Nehlin","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kallemose","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Ove Andersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"UZ Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adrian Liston","author_inst":"VIB Center for Brain and Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Belgium; The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Humblet-Baron","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20114934","rel_title":"Global between-countries variance in SARS-CoV-2 mortality is driven by reported prevalence, age distribution, and case detection rate","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20114934","rel_abs":"Objective: To explain the global between-countries variance in number of deaths per million citizens (nDpm) and case fatality rate (CFR) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design: Systematic analysis. Data sources: Worldometer, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, United Nations Main outcome measures: The explanators of nDpm and CFR were mathematically hypothesised and tested on publicly-available data from 88 countries with linear regression models on May 1st 2020. The derived explanators - age-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFRadj) and case detection rate (CDR) - were estimated for each country based on a SARS-CoV-2 model of China. The accuracy and agreement of the models with observed data was assessed with R2 and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. Sensitivity analyses involved removal of outliers and testing the models at five retrospective and two prospective time points. Results: Globally, IFRadj estimates varied between countries, ranging from below 0.2% in the youngest nations, to above 1.3% in Portugal, Greece, Italy, and Japan. The median estimated global CDR of SARS-CoV-2 infections on April 16th 2020 was 12.9%, suggesting that most of the countries have a much higher number of cases than reported. At least 93% and up to 99% of the variance in nDpm was explained by reported prevalence expressed as cases per million citizens (nCpm), IFRadj, and CDR. IFRadj and CDR accounted for up to 97% of the variance in CFR, but this model was less reliable than the nDpm model, being sensitive to outliers (R2 as low as 67.5%). Conclusions: The current differences in SARS-CoV-2 mortality between countries are driven mainly by reported prevalence of infections, age distribution, and CDR. The nDpm might be a more stable estimate than CFR in comparing mortality burden between countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haris Baba\u010di\u0107","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Janne Lehti\u00f6","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Maria Pernemalm","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Marius Stauning","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Hejdi Gamst-Jensen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Mette Bendz Lindstroem","author_inst":"Copenhage University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Line Jee Hartmann Rasmussen","author_inst":"Duke University, USA"},{"author_name":"Klaus Tjelle Kristiansen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Christian Rasmussen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jan Nehlin","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kallemose","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Ove Andersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"UZ Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adrian Liston","author_inst":"VIB Center for Brain and Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Belgium; The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Humblet-Baron","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119446","rel_title":"Performance of suspected influenza case definitionbefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119446","rel_abs":"Background: The influenza-related burden remains high and the COVID-19 pandemic may difficult its accurate surveillance.

Conclusions: The evaluated case definition remains to be a cost-effective alternative to identify patients who may benefit from influenza-specific antiviral drugs, even during the COVID-19 global outbreak.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Efren Murillo-Zamora","author_inst":"Mexican Institute of Social Security"},{"author_name":"CARLOS M HERNANDEZ-SUAREZ","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDAD DE COLIMA"},{"author_name":"Maria Pernemalm","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Marius Stauning","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Hejdi Gamst-Jensen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Mette Bendz Lindstroem","author_inst":"Copenhage University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Line Jee Hartmann Rasmussen","author_inst":"Duke University, USA"},{"author_name":"Klaus Tjelle Kristiansen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Christian Rasmussen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jan Nehlin","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kallemose","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Ove Andersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"UZ Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adrian Liston","author_inst":"VIB Center for Brain and Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Belgium; The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Humblet-Baron","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119800","rel_title":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic course in Saudi Arabia: A dynamic epidemiological model","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119800","rel_abs":"Objective: Saudi Arabia ranks second in the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the Eastern Mediterranean region. It houses the two most sacred religious places for Muslims: Mecca and Medina. It is important to know what the trend in case numbers will be in the next 4-6 months, especially during the Hajj pilgrimage season. Methods: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 were obtained from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization, and the Humanitarian Data Exchange. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) prediction model was constructed to predict the trend in COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia in the next 6 months. Findings: The model predicts that the number of active cases will peak by 20 May 2020. The cumulative infected cases are predicted to reach 59,663 at that time. The total number of infected individuals is estimated reach to 102,647 by the end of the pandemic. Conclusion: Our estimates show that by the time the Hajj season commences in Saudi Arabia, the pandemic will be in the midst of its deceleration phase (phase 3). This information will likely be useful to policymakers in their management of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdullah Murhaf Al-Khani","author_inst":"Sulaiman Al Rajhi University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Abdelghafour Khalifa","author_inst":"Sulaiman Al Rajhi University"},{"author_name":"Abdulrahman AlMazrou","author_inst":"Sulaiman Al Rajhi University"},{"author_name":"Nazmus Saquib","author_inst":"Sulaiman Al Rajhi University"},{"author_name":"Hejdi Gamst-Jensen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Mette Bendz Lindstroem","author_inst":"Copenhage University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Line Jee Hartmann Rasmussen","author_inst":"Duke University, USA"},{"author_name":"Klaus Tjelle Kristiansen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Christian Rasmussen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jan Nehlin","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kallemose","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Ove Andersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"UZ Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adrian Liston","author_inst":"VIB Center for Brain and Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Belgium; The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Humblet-Baron","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20113571","rel_title":"A Time-Dependent SEIRD Model for Forecasting the COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20113571","rel_abs":"The spread of a disease caused by a virus can happen through human to human contact or could be from the environment. A mathematical model could be used to capture the dynamics of the disease spread to estimate the infections, recoveries, and fatalities that may result from the disease. An estimation is crucial to make policy decisions and for the alerts for the medical emergencies that may arise. Many epidemiological models are being used to make such an estimation. One major factor that is important in the forecasts using the models is the dynamic nature of the disease spread. Unless we can come up with a way of estimating the parameters that guide this dynamic spread, the models may not give accurate forecasts. The main principle is to keep the model generic while making minimal assumptions. In this work, we have derived a data-driven model from SEIRD, where we attempt to forecast Infected, Recovered and Deceased rates of COVID-19 up to a week. A method of estimating the parameters of the model is also discussed thoroughly in this work. The model is tested for India at a district level along with the most affected foreign cities like Lombardia from Italy and Moscow from Russia.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taarak Rapolu","author_inst":"University of Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Brahmani Nutakki","author_inst":"University of Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"T.

We found that nucleotide variations at the genomic position 11,083, locating in the coding region of non-structural protein 6, were associated with the COVID-19 severity. While the 11083G variant (i.e. having G at the position 11,083) was more commonly found in symptomatic patients, the 11083T variant appeared to associate more often with asymptomatic infections. We also identified three microRNAs that differentially target the two variants, namely miR-485-3p, miR-539-3p, and miR-3149.

However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the association between NSAID use and the risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among hospitalised patients. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using South Korea nationwide healthcare database, which contains data of all subjects who received a test for COVID-19 (n=69,793) as of April 8, 2020. We identified a cohort of adults hospitalised with COVID-19, where cohort entry was the date of hospitalisation. NSAIDs users were those prescribed NSAIDs in the 7 days before and including the date of cohort entry and non-users were those not prescribed NSAIDs during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis; our secondary outcome was cardiovascular or renal complications. We conducted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize potential confounding. FINDINGS: Of 1,824 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 (mean age 49.0 years, standard deviation 19.0 years; female 59%), 354 were NSAIDs users and 1,470 were non-users. Compared with non-use, NSAIDs use was associated with increased risks of the primary composite outcome (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.21-2.24) and of cardiovascular or renal complications (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.25-2.80). Our main findings remained consistent when we extended the exposure ascertainment window to include the first three days of hospitalisation (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.06-3.29). INTERPRETATION: Use of NSAIDs, compared with non-use, is associated with worse outcomes among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. While awaiting the results of confirmatory studies, we suggest NSAIDs be used with caution among patients with COVID-19 as the harms associated with their use may outweigh their benefits in this population.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Han Eol Jeong","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Hyesung Lee","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Hyun Joon Shin","author_inst":"Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical Sc"},{"author_name":"Young June Choe","author_inst":"Hallym University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kristian B Filion","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University and Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Ju-Young Shin","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Line Jee Hartmann Rasmussen","author_inst":"Duke University, USA"},{"author_name":"Klaus Tjelle Kristiansen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Christian Rasmussen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jan Nehlin","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kallemose","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Ove Andersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"UZ Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adrian Liston","author_inst":"VIB Center for Brain and Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Belgium; The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Humblet-Baron","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114538","rel_title":"COVID-19 containment in the Caribbean: the experience of Small Island Developing States","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114538","rel_abs":"Background. Small island developing states (SIDS) have limited absolute resources for responding to national disasters, including health emergencies. Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Caribbean on 1st March 2020, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been widely used to control the resulting COVID-19 outbreak. We document the variety of government measures introduced across the Caribbean and explore their impact on aspects of outbreak control. Methods. Drawing on publically available information, we present confirmed cases and confirmed deaths to describe the extent of the Caribbean outbreak. We document the range of outbreak containment measures implemented by national Governments, focussing on measures to control movement and gatherings. We explore the temporal association of containment measures with the start of the outbreak in each country, and with aggregated information on human movement, using smartphone positioning data. We include a set of comparator countries to provide an international context. Results. As of 25th May, the Caribbean reported 18,755 confirmed cases and 631 deaths. There have been broad similarities but also variation in the number, the type, the intensity, and particularly the timing of the NPIs introduced across the Caribbean. On average, Caribbean governments began controlling movement into countries 27 days before their first confirmed case and 23 days before comparator countries. Controls on movement within country were introduced 9 days after the first case and 36 days before comparators. Controls on gatherings were implemented 1 day before the first confirmed case and 30 days before comparators. Confirmed case growth rates and numbers of deaths have remained low across much the Caribbean. Stringent Caribbean curfews and stay-at-home orders coincided with large reductions in community mobility, regularly above 60%, and higher than most international comparator countries. Conclusion. Stringent controls to limit movement, and specifically the early timing of those controls has had an important impact on containing the spread of COVID-19 across much of the Caribbean. Very early controls to limit movement into countries may well be particularly effective for small island developing states. With much of the region economically reliant on international tourism, and with steps to open borders now being considered, it is critical that the region draws on a solid evidence-base to balance the competing demands of economics and public health.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madhuvanti M Murphy","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Selvi M Jeyaseelan","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Christina Howitt","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Natalie Greaves","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Heather Harewood","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Kim R Quimby","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Natasha Sobers","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"R Clive Landis","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Kern Rocke","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Ian R Hambleton","author_inst":"The University of the West Indies"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kallemose","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Ove Andersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"UZ Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adrian Liston","author_inst":"VIB Center for Brain and Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Belgium; The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Humblet-Baron","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengping Qin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Gao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Zhao Hu","author_inst":"Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20115196","rel_title":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Exhaled Breath from COVID-19 Patients Ready for Hospital Discharge","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20115196","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented crisis to the global health sector1.

This research focuses on emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to the COVID-19 reopening debate, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more positive sentiment support, than negative, for reopening the US economy. This research develops a novel sentiment polarity based four scenarios framework, which will remain useful for future crisis analysis, well beyond COVID-19. With additional validation, this research stream could present valuable time sensitive opportunities for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide local and regional communities, and the nation into a successful new normal future.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jim Samuel","author_inst":"University of Charleston, WV, USA"},{"author_name":"Md Mokhlesur Rahman","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA and Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), Khulna, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"G.

Of 689 participants, more than half had good knowledge; 80% had good practices regarding COVID-19 and majority seek knowledge from social media. Knowledge was significantly higher (OR>1.00, p<0.05) among educated and higher income participants. Positive practices were significantly (OR>1.00, p<0.05) related to the older age ([&ge;]50 years), higher education, higher income and good knowledge regarding COVID-19. The study concluded that Pakistani residents had good knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 yet there are gaps in specific aspects of knowledge, and practice that should be focused in future awareness and educational campaigns. The study recommends the ministry of health authorities to promote all precautionary and preventive measures of COVID-19-consisting of a better-organized approach- to all strata of society: less privileged people, older ones and less educated people, in order to have equilibrium of knowledge about COVID-19; hence effective implementation of precautionary measures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Saqlain","author_inst":"Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmed","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, Monash University, Bander Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia."},{"author_name":"Aqsa Gulzar","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmacy, Lahore College for Women University, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sahar Naz","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy, The University of Faisalabad, Faisalabad"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muddasir Munir","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmaceutical sciences, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, 54000, Lahore."},{"author_name":"Zaheer Ahmed","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Islamabad."},{"author_name":"Sohail Kamran","author_inst":"Quaid I Azam University, Islamabad"},{"author_name":"Yun Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Province Hospital), Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Meng Du","author_inst":"Zhenjiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Bochao Sun","author_inst":"Yancheng Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Yancheng, China"},{"author_name":"Yunyu Jiang","author_inst":"Taizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Taizhou, China"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhou","author_inst":"Suzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Hong","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Na Yu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Zhen Ding","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Min Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sergey A.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the whereabouts of the virus and whether useful precautions to prevent the dissemination can be given. 21 households under quarantine conditions were randomly selected for this study. All persons living in each household were recorded in terms of age, sex and time of household quarantine. Throat swabs for analysis were obtained from all adult individuals and most of the children. Air, wastewater samples and surface swabs (commodities) were obtained and analysed by RT-PCR. Positive swabs were cultivated to analyse for viral infectivity. 26 of all 43 tested adults (60.47 %) tested positive by RT-PCR. All 15 air samples were PCR-negative. 10 of 66 wastewater samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (15.15 %) as well as 4 of 119 object samples (3.36 %). No statistically significant correlation between PCR-positive environmental samples and the extent of infection spread inside the household could be observed. No infectious virus could be isolated under cell culture conditions. As we cannot rule out transmission through surfaces, hygienic behavioural measures are important in the households of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to avoid potential transmission through surfaces. The role of the domestic environment, in particular the wastewater load in washbasins and showers, in the transmission of SARS CoV-2 should be further clarified.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuel D\u00f6hla","author_inst":"University Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"University Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Biance Schulte","author_inst":"University Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Beate Mareike K\u00fcmmerer","author_inst":"University Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Christin Diegmann","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Enrico Richter","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Haag","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Steffen Engelhart","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Eis-H\u00fcbinger","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Maria Schmithausen","author_inst":"University Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Na Yu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Zhen Ding","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Min Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sergey A.

In this paper, we report on an online survey among Dutch citizens with the goal to identify antecedents of acceptance of a mobile application for COVID-19 symptom recognition and monitoring, and a mobile application for contact tracing. Methods: Next to the demographics, the online survey contained questions focussing on perceived health, fear of COVID-19 and intention to use. We used snowball sampling via posts on social media and personal connections. To identify antecedents of acceptance of the two mobile applications we conducted multiple linear regression analyses. Results: In total, 238 Dutch adults completed the survey. Almost 60% of the responders were female and the average age was 45.6 years (SD=17.4). For the symptom app, the final model included the predictors age, attitude towards technology and fear of COVID-19. The model had an R2 of 0.141. The final model for the tracing app included the same predictors and had an R2 of 0.156. The main reason to use both mobile applications was to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Concerns about privacy was mentioned as the main reason not to use the mobile applications. Discussion: Age, attitude towards technology and fear of COVID-19 are important predictors of the acceptance of COVID-19 mobile applications for symptom recognition and monitoring and for contact tracing. These predictors should be taken into account during the development and implementation of these mobile applications to secure acceptance.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie Maria Jansen-Kosterink","author_inst":"Roessingh Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Marian Hurmuz","author_inst":"Roessingh Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Marjolein den Ouden","author_inst":"Saxion University of Applied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lex van Velsen","author_inst":"Roessingh Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christin Diegmann","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Enrico Richter","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Haag","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Steffen Engelhart","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Eis-H\u00fcbinger","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Maria Schmithausen","author_inst":"University Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Na Yu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Zhen Ding","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Min Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sergey A.

Objectives: We investigated the expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 in lung tissue from never smokers and smokers with and without COPD. Methods: In a cross-sectional, observational study we measured mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by RT-PCR in lung tissue samples from 120 well phenotyped subjects. Next, protein levels of ACE2 were visualized by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from 87 subjects and quantified in alveolar and bronchial epithelium. Finally, primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were cultured at air liquid interface and exposed to air or cigarette smoke. Results: ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in lung tissue from current smokers and subjects with moderate to very severe COPD and correlated with physiological parameters of airway obstruction and emphysema. Pulmonary expression levels of TMPRSS2 were significantly higher in patients with (very) severe COPD and correlated significantly with ACE2 expression. Importantly, protein levels of ACE2 were elevated in both alveolar and bronchial epithelium of current smokers and subjects with moderate to very severe COPD. Finally, TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increased in in vitro cultured HBECs upon acute exposure to cigarette smoke. Conclusions: We demonstrate increased expression of ACE2 in lungs of smokers and COPD subjects, which might facilitate host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. These findings help identifying populations at risk for severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Merel Jacobs","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Hannelore P Van Eeckhoutte","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Sara RA Wijnant","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Wim Janssens","author_inst":"University Hospital Leuven"},{"author_name":"Guy F Joos","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Guy G Brusselle","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Ken R Bracke","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Haag","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Steffen Engelhart","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Eis-H\u00fcbinger","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University of Bonn, Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Maria Schmithausen","author_inst":"University Bonn, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Na Yu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China"},{"author_name":"Zhen Ding","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Department of Environment and Health, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Min Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sergey A.

For the dry heat treatment we consider the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M8210+ models. After five cycles of the dry heating method, all three FFR models pass both fit and filtration tests, showing no degradation. For the autoclave tests we consider the 3M 1870, and the 3M 8210+. We find significant degradation of the FFRs following the 121 {degrees}C autoclave cycles. The molded mask tested (3M 8210+) failed fit testing after just 1 cycle in the autoclave. The pleated (3M 1870) mask passed fit testing for 5 cycles, but failed filtration testing. The 95 {degrees}C dry heat cycle is scalable to over a thousand masks per day in a hospital setting, and is above the temperature which has been shown to achieve the requisite 3 log kill of SARS-CoV-2[1], making it a promising method for N95 decontamination and reuse.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cole Meisenhelder","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Lo\u00efc Anderegg","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Preecha","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Chiu Oan Ngooi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Lei Liao","author_inst":"4C Air"},{"author_name":"Wang Xiao","author_inst":"4C Air"},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"John M Doyle","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Chiara Benzoni","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Gaudiano","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Davide Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy; Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Min Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sergey A.

Respiratory failure is a key feature of severe Covid-19 and a critical driver of mortality, but for reasons poorly defined affects less than 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Methods. We included 1,980 patients with Covid-19 respiratory failure at seven centers in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe (Milan, Monza, Madrid, San Sebastian and Barcelona) for a genome-wide association analysis. After quality control and exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1,255 population-derived controls from Italy, and 775 patients and 950 controls from Spain were included in the final analysis. In total we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conducted a meta-analysis of both case-control panels. Results. We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 and rs657152 at 9q34, which were genome-wide significant (P<5x10-8) in the meta-analysis of both study panels, odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P=1.14x10-10 and OR 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P=4.95x10-8), respectively. Among six genes at 3p21.31, SLC6A20 encodes a known interaction partner with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The association signal at 9q34 was located at the ABO blood group locus and a blood-group-specific analysis showed higher risk for A-positive individuals (OR=1.45, 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75, P=1.48x10-4) and a protective effect for blood group O (OR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79, P=1.06x10-5).
