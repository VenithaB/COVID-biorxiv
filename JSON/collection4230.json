Socio-environmental measures implemented as Ireland s prudent response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic represented, in effect, a national lockdown and have possibly influenced the health and wellbeing of pregnant women and unborn infants. Cumulative impact of such socio-environmental factors operating contemporaneously on PTB has never been assessed before. Methods: Regional PTB trends of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in one designated health area of Ireland over two decades were analysed. Poisson regression and rate ratio analyses with 95% CI were conducted. Observed regional data from January to April 2020 were compared to historical regional and national data and forecasted national figures for 2020. Results: Poisson regression analysis found that the regional historical VLBW rate per 1000 live births for January to April, 2001 to 2019 was 8.18 (95% CI: 7.21, 9.29). During January to April 2020, an unusually low VLBW rate of just 2.17 per 1000 live births was observed. The rate ratio of 3.77 (95% CI: 1.21, 11.75), p = 0.022, estimates that for the last two decades there was, on average, 3.77 times the rate of VLBW, compared to the period January to April 2020 during which there is a 73% reduction. National Irish VLBW rate for 2020 is forecasted to be reduced to 400 per 60,000 births compared to historical 500 to 600 range. Conclusion: An unprecedented reduction in PTB of VLBW infants was observed in one health region of Ireland during the COVID-19 lockdown. Potential determinants of this unique temporal trend reside in the summative socio-environmental impact of the COVID-19 dictated lockdown. Our findings, if mirrored in other regions that have adopted similar measures to combat the pandemic, demonstrate the potential to evaluate these implicated interdependent behavioural and socio-environmental modifiers to positively influence PTB rates globally.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roy K Philip","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Paediatrics, University Maternity Hospital Limerick, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Helen Purtill","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Reidy","author_inst":"Department of Midwifery and Neonatal Nursing, University Maternity Hospital, Limerick, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mandy Daly","author_inst":"Advocacy and Policymaking, Irish Neonatal Health Alliance (INHA), Bray, Wicklow, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Mendinaro Imcha","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Maternity Hospital, Limerick, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Deirdre McGrath","author_inst":"Head of School, School of Medicine University ofLimerick, Limerick, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Nuala H O'Connell","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, University Hospital Limerick, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Colum P Dunne","author_inst":"Head of Research, School of Medicine and Centre for Interventions in Infection, Inflammation and Immunity (4i), University of Limerick, Ireland."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20121863","rel_title":"COVID-19 and climate: global evidence from 117 countries","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20121863","rel_abs":"Visual inspection of world maps shows that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is less prevalent in countries closer to the equator, where heat and humidity tend to be higher.

We regress confirmed COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants in a country against the country's distance from the equator, controlling key confounding factors: air travel, distance to Wuhan, testing intensity, cell phone usage, vehicle concentration, urbanization, and income. A one-degree increase in absolute latitude is associated with a 2.6% increase in cases per million inhabitants (p value <0.001).

Design Scoping review. Methods Two parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the review and the need to report the most up-to-date information for an ever-evolving situation, there were no restrictions on language, information sources utilised, publication status, and types of sources of evidence. The AACODS checklist was used to appraise each source of evidence. Outcome measures Publication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19 specific data, demographics of affected HCWs, and public health measures employed Results A total of 152,888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported. Infections were mainly in women (71.6%) and nurses (38.6%), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%) and doctors (51.4%). Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths. There were 37.17 deaths reported per 100 infections for healthcare workers aged over 70. Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7). Conclusions HCW COVID-19 infections and deaths follow that of the general world population. The reasons for gender and speciality differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported from Africa and India. Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high-risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated. Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine, or administrative positions. Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.","rel_num_authors":64,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soham Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ronnie E Baticulon","author_inst":"University of the Philippines

The study was conducted on 3 sites, following the same protocol procedures, and involved a total of 18 dogs. A total of 198 armpits sweat samples were obtained from different hospitals. For each involved dog, the acquisition of the specific odour of COVID-19 sweat samples required from one to four hours, with an amount of positive samples sniffing ranging from four to ten. For this proof of concept, we kept 8 dogs of the initial group (explosive detection dogs and colon cancer detection dogs), who performed a total of 368 trials, and will include the other dogs in our future studies as their adaptation to samples scenting takes more time.The percentages of success of the dogs to find the positive sample in a line containing several other negative samples or mocks (2 to 6) were 100p100 for 4 dogs, and respectively 83p100, 84p100, 90p100 and 94p100 for the others, all significantly different from the percentage of success that would be obtained by chance alone.We conclude that there is a very high evidence that the armpits sweat odour of COVID-19+ persons is different, and that dogs can detect a person infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Competing

unprecedented demand for personal protective equipment. Shortages of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has led to the extended use or re-use of single-use respirators and surgical masks by frontline healthcare workers. The evidence base underpinning such practices has been questioned. Objectives To summarise guidance and synthesise systematic review evidence on extended use, re-use or reprocessing of single-use surgical masks or filtering facepiece respirators. Methods A targeted search of the World Health Organization, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England websites was conducted to identify guidance. Four databases (Medline, Pubmed, Epistemonikos, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and three preprint repositories (Litcovid, MedRxiv and Open Science Framework) were searched for relevant systematic reviews. Record screening and data extraction was conducted by two reviewers. Quality of included systematic reviews was appraised using the AMSTAR-2 checklist. Findings were integrated and narratively synthesised to highlight the extent to which key claims in guidance documents were supported by research evidence. Results Six guidance documents were identified. All note that extended use or re-use of single-use surgical masks and respirators (with or without reprocessing) should be considered only in situations of critical shortage. Extended use was generally favoured over re-use because of reduced risk of contact transmission. Four high-quality systematic reviews were included: three focused on reprocessing (decontamination) of N95 respirators and one focused on reprocessing of surgical masks. There was limited evidence on the impact of extended use on masks and respirators. Vaporised hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation were highlighted as the most promising reprocessing methods, but evidence on the relative efficacy and safety of different methods was limited. We found no well-established methods for reprocessing respirators at scale. Conclusions: There is limited evidence on the impact of extended use and re-use of surgical masks and respirators. Where extended use or re-use is being practiced, healthcare organisations should ensure that policies and systems are in place to ensure these practices are carried out safely and in line with available guidance.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elaine Toomey","author_inst":"University of Limerick"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Conway","author_inst":"National University of

global pandemic with a viral infection called COVID-19. The disease usually causes respiratory symptoms but in a small proportion of patients can lead to pneumonitis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and death. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) is considered a life-saving treatment for COVID-19 patients and a huge demand for IMV devices was reported globally. This review aims to provide insight on the initial IMV practices for COVID-19 patients in the initial phase of the pandemic. Methods: Electronic databases (Embase and MEDLINE) were searched for applicable articles using relevant keywords. The references of included articles were hand searched. Articles that reported the use of IMV in adult COVID-19 patients were included in the review. The NIH quality assessment tool for cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to appraise studies. Results: 106 abstracts were identified from the databases search, of which 16 were included. 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 9988 patients were included across all studies. The overall cases of COVID-19 requiring IMV ranged from 2-75%. Increased age and pre-existing comorbidities increased the likelihood of IMV requirement. The reported mortality rate in patients receiving IMV ranged between 50-100%. On average, IMV was required and initiated between 10-10.5 days from symptoms onset. When invasively ventilated, COVID-19 patients required IMV for a median of 10-17 days across studies. Little information was provided on ventilatory protocols or management strategies and was inconclusive. Conclusion: In these initial reporting studies for the first month of the pandemic, patients receiving IMV were older and had more pre-existing co-morbidities than those who did not require IMV. The mortality rate was high in COVID-19 patients who received IMV. Studies are needed to evaluate protocols and modalities of IMV to improve outcomes and identify the populations most likely to benefit from IMV.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed A Almeshari","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nowaf Y Alobaidi","author_inst":"University of

triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is unbalanced, presenting an acute respiratory distress syndrome which in many cases requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The limitation of ICU beds has been one of the major burdens in the management around the world, therefore, clinical strategies to avoid ICU admission are needed. Objective We aimed to describe the influence of tocilizumab on the need of transfer to ICU or death in non-critically ill patients. Methods A retrospective study of 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not qualify as requiring transfer to ICU during the first 24h after admission to a conventional ward, were included. The criteria to receive tocilizumab was radiological impairment, oxygen demand or an increasing of inflammatory parameters, however, the ultimate decision was left to the attending physician judgement. The primary outcome was the need of ICU admission or death whichever came first. Results 77 patients received tocilizumab and 94 did not. The tocilizumab group had less ICU admissions (10.3% vs. 27.6%, P= 0.005) and need of invasive ventilation (0 vs 13.8%, P=0.001). In the multivariable analysis, tocilizumab remained as a protective variable (OR: 0.03, CI 95%: 0.007-0*1, P=0.0001) of ICU admission or death. Conclusions Tocilizumab in the early stages of the inflammatory flare, could avoid an important number of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation use. The mortality rate of 10.3% among patients receiving tocilizumab appears to be lower than other reports.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Estela Moreno

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. The increasing sequencing data have shown abundant single nucleotide variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, it is difficult to quickly analyze genomic variation and screen key mutations of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we developed a visual program, named BioAider, for quick and convenient sequence annotation and mutation analysis on multiple genome-sequencing data. Using BioAider, we conducted a comprehensive genome variation analysis on 3,240 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Herein, we detected 14 substitution hotspots within SARS-CoV-2 genome, including 10 non-synonymous and 4 synonymous ones. Among these hotspots, NSP13-Y541C was predicted to be a crucial substitution which might affect the unwinding activity of NSP13, a key protein for viral replication. Besides, we also found 3 groups of potentially linked substitution hotspots which were worth further study. In particular, we discovered a SR-rich region (aa 184-204) on the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 distinct from SARS-CoV, indicating more complex replication mechanism and unique N-M interaction of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the quantity of SRXX repeat fragments in the SR-rich region well reflected the evolutionary relationship among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related animal coronaviruses, providing further evidence of its animal origin. Overall, we developed an efficient tool for rapid identification of mutations, identified substitution hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and detected a distinctive polymorphism SR-rich region in N protein. This tool and the detected hotspots could facilitate the viral genomic study and may contribute for screening antiviral target sites.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhi-Jian

emerged coronavirus disease COVID-19 has now evolved into a global pandemic. Early detection is crucial for its effective control. Nucleic acid testing for viral pathogen and serological testing for host antibodies are playing important roles in current COVID-19 diagnosis. However, while nucleic acid testing is complicated, facility-restricted and time-consuming, antibody testing may result in high rates of false-negative diagnoses, especially during the early stages of viral infection. Thus, a more rapid and reliable test for both early COVID-19 diagnosis and whole-population screening is urgently needed. Here, we developed a novel nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and high-sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. Our paper test uses a newly established peroxidase-mimic Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme instead of natural HRP that catalytically amplifies the chemiluminescent signal, allowing for target concentrations to be as low as 0.1 ng\/ml. Furthermore, our nanozyme-based chemiluminescence test exhibits a linear range that is 32-fold wider compared to ELISA tests. Importantly, testing is completed in less than 16 min, compared to 1-2 h required for ELISA or nucleic acid tests. Critically, signal detection is feasible using a smartphone camera. Ingredients for our test are simple and readily available, rendering overall cost considerably lower than those used in current diagnoses. In conclusion, our novel test provides a high-sensitive, point-of-care testing (POCT) approach for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, which should greatly increase current early screening capacities for suspected infections, and considerably lower demand for national healthcare resources.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Liu","author_inst":"CAS Engineering Laboratory for

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 386,000 deaths globally as of June 4, 2020. In this study, we developed a novel multiplex real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR test for detection of SARS-CoV-2, with primers designed to amplify a 108 bp target on the spike surface glycoprotein (S gene) of SARS-CoV-2 and a hydrolysis Taqman probe designed to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2. Following our design, we evaluated the Limit of detection (LOD) and clinical performance of this laboratory-developed test (LDT). A LOD study with inactivated whole virus exhibited equal performance to that seen in the modified CDC assay with a final LOD of 1,301 \u00b1 13 genome equivalents\/ml for our assay vs 1,249 \u00b1 14 genome equivalents\/ml for the modified CDC assay. In addition, a clinical evaluation with 270 nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens exhibited 98.5% positive percent agreement and 99.3% negative percent agreement with the modified CDC assay. The multiplex design of this assay allows the testing of 91 patients per plate, versus a maximum of 29 patients per plate on the modified CDC assay, providing the benefit of testing significantly more patients per run and saving reagents during a time when both of these parameters have been critical. Our results demonstrate that our multiplex assay performs as well as the modified CDC assay, but is more efficient and cost effective and is therefore adequate for use as a diagnostic assay and for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zhen","author_inst":"Northwell Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Berry","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Richard T Eastman","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Xin Hu","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Ke Wang","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Mark Backus","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Bolormaa Baljinnyam","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z.

We compared the performance of four of these assays that were being evaluated for use at our institution: Abbott RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay, DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID NOW COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens were collected from 88 ED and hospital-admitted patients and tested by the four methods in parallel to compare performance. ID NOW performance stood out as significantly worse than the other three assays despite demonstrating comparable analytic sensitivity. Further study determined that the use of a foam nasal swab compared to a nylon flocked nasopharyngeal swab, as well as use in a population chronically vs. acutely positive for SARS-CoV-2, were significant factors in the poor comparable performance.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Robert Lephart","author_inst":"Michigan Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael A Bachman","author_inst":"University of Michigan-Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"William LeBar","author_inst":"University of Michigan Health System"},{"author_name":"Scott Wayne McClellan","author_inst":"Michigan Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Barron","author_inst":"Michigan Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lee Schroeder","author_inst":"University of Michigan-Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Duane W.

caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus discovered in December 2019 and closely related to the SARS coronavirus (CoV). Both viruses use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry, recognizing it with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike (S) protein. The S2 domain mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Experience with SARS and MERS coronavirus has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS) and block the virus cell entry. Assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against SARS-CoV-2, we used phage display to select from the human naive universal antibody gene libraries HAL9\/10 anti SARS2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction with ACE2. 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1 were identified. 17 showed more than 75% inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2, assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50% inhibition at a molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or RBD of 1:1. Furthermore, these antibodies neutralized active SARS-Cov-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. All 17 were all able to bind the isolated RBD, four of them with sub-nanomolar EC50. Epitope analysis of the antibodies revealed that six bind at the RBD-ACE2 interface and two on the opposite side of the domain. Universal libraries from healthy donors offer the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the availability of material from recovered patients in a pandemic situation.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Federico Bertoglio","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Doris Meier","author_inst":"TU Braunschweig"},{"author_name":"Nora

defining pandemic of this era. Animal models are essential to fast track new interventions and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of other infectious diseases have proven extremely valuable. Here we compare SARS-CoV-2 infection in three species of experimentally infected NHPs (rhesus macaques, baboons, and marmosets). During the first 3 days, macaques developed clinical signatures of viral infection and systemic inflammation, coupled with early evidence of viral replication and mild-to-moderate interstitial and alveolar pneumonitis, as well as extra-pulmonary pathologies. Cone-beam CT scans showed evidence of moderate pneumonia, which progressed over 3 days. Longitudinal studies showed that while both young and old macaques developed early signs of COVID-19, both groups recovered within a two-week period. Recovery was characterized by low-levels of viral persistence in the lung, suggesting mechanisms by which individuals with compromised immune systems may be susceptible to prolonged and progressive COVID-19. The lung compartment contained a complex early inflammatory milieu with an influx of innate and adaptive immune cells, particularly interstitial macrophages, neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and a prominent Type I-interferon response. While macaques developed moderate disease, baboons exhibited prolonged shedding of virus and extensive pathology following infection; and marmosets demonstrated a milder form of infection. These results showcase in critical detail, the robust early cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are not sterilizing and likely impact development of antibody responses. Thus, various NHP genera recapitulate heterogeneous progression of COVID-19. Rhesus macaques and baboons develop different, quantifiable disease attributes making them immediately available essential models to test new vaccines and therapies.","rel_num_authors":58,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhiraj K.

We designed a fluorescent based cleavage assay to rapidly screen the protease activity of NSP3 and NSP5 on a library of 71 human innate immune proteins (HIIPs), covering most pathways involved in human innate immunity. By expressing each of these HIIPs with a genetically encoded fluorophore in a cell-free system and titrating in the recombinant protease domain of NSP3 or NSP5, we could readily detect cleavage of cognate HIIPs on SDS-page gels. We identified 3 proteins that were specifically and selectively cleaved by NSP3 or NSP5: IRF-3, and NLRP12 and TAB1, respectively. Direct cleavage of IRF3 by NSP3 could explain the blunted Type- I IFN response seen during SARS-CoV-2 infections while NSP5 mediated cleavage of NLRP12 and TAB1 point to a molecular mechanism for enhanced production of IL-6 and inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, both NLRP12 and TAB1 have each two distinct cleavage sites. We demonstrate that in mice, the second cleavage site of NLRP12 is absent. We pushed this comparative alignment of IRF-3 and NLRP12 homologs and show that the lack or presence of cognate cleavage motifs in IRF-3 and NLRP12 could contribute to the presentation of disease in cats and tigers, for example. Our findings provide an explanatory framework for in-depth studies into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and should facilitate the search or development of more effective animal models for severe COVID-19. Finally, we discovered that one particular species of bats, Davids Myotis, possesses the five cleavage sites found in humans for NLRP12, TAB1 and IRF3. These bats are endemic from the Hubei province in China and we discuss its potential role as reservoir for the evolution of SARS1 and SASR2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehdi Moustaqil","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Emma Ollivier","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Hsin-Ping Chiu","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Paulina Rudolffi-Soto","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Sarah Van Tol","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Christian Stevens","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

Early research has suggested that pre-existing fatty liver disease may be a significant risk factor for hospitalisation. Liver fat, in particular, is a modifiable parameter and can be a target for public health policy and individual patient plans. In this study we aimed to assess pre-existing liver disease as a risk factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19. Methods From 502,506 participants from the UK Biobank, 42,146 underwent MRI (aged 45-82), and had measures of liver fat, liver fibroinflammatory disease and liver iron. Patients were censored on May 28th to determine how many had tested for COVID-19 with symptomatic disease. UK testing was restricted to those with symptoms in hospital. COVID-19 symptoms included fever, dry cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and fatigue. Univariate analysis was performed on liver phenotypic biomarkers to determine if these variables increased risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and compared to previously described risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including to age, ethnicity, gender and obesity, Findings Increased liver fat was associated with a higher risk for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 in this population in univariate analysis(OR:1.85, p=0.03). In obese participants, only those with concomitant fatty liver([&ge;]10%) were at increased risk(OR:2.96, p=0.02), with those having normal liver fat (<5%) showing no increased risk(OR:0.36, p=0.09). Conclusions UK Biobank data demonstrated an association between pre-existing liver disease and obesity with severe COVID-19, with higher proportions of liver fat in obese individuals a likely risk factor for symptomatic disease and severity. Public policy measures to protect patients with liver disease who may have almost double the risk of the general population should be considered, especially as dietary and pharmacological strategies to reduce body weight and liver fat already exist.

Herein, we characterized the potential G-quadruplexes both in the positive and negative-sense viral stands. The identified potential G-quadruplexes exhibits similar features to the G-quadruplexes detected in the human transcriptome. Within some bat and pangolin related beta coronaviruses, the G-quartets rather than the loops are under heightened selective constraints. We also found that the SUD-like sequence is retained in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, while some other coronaviruses that can infect humans are depleted. Further analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 SUD-like sequence is almost conserved among 16,466 SARS-CoV-2 samples. And the SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like dimer displayed similar electrostatic potential pattern to the SUD dimer. Considering the potential value of G-quadruplexes to serve as targets in antiviral strategy, we hope our fundamental research could provide new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongxin Zhang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Ke Xiao","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Hongde Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Sun","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Rajarshi Banerjee","author_inst":"Perspectum Ltd"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

To do this, we examined the frequency of once ordinary, but newly risky behavior (as deemed by CDC guidelines) in a sample of 482 MTurkers. We ran analyses probing the situational and dispositional variables that predicted variance in risky behavior using data-driven and hypothesis-generated approaches. We found situational and dispositional variables contributed unique variance to risky behavior, controlling for variability accounted for by demographic factors. More frequent report of risky activity was associated with higher extraversion, need for cognitive closure, behavior activation, and perceived resource scarcity; in contrast, more frequent report of risky activity was associated with less empathy and living space access, as well as younger age. To break down these findings, we used a cluster analysis to profile individuals, using only situational and dispositional variables belonging to seven clusters. Combined with testing differences in risk taking by cluster identity, we suggest this profile approach might allow consideration of multi-faceted attributes that influence adherence with public health guidance in the context of health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongxin Zhang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Ke Xiao","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Hongde Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Sun","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Rajarshi Banerjee","author_inst":"Perspectum Ltd"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic, the question emerges whether human-to-animal transmission is possible and if so, which animal species are most at risk. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o PGLM Rodrigues","author_inst":"Department of Structural Biology - Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Susana Barrera-Vilarmau","author_inst":"Institute of Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia (IQAC) - CSIC"},{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o MC Teixeira","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Seckel","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis L Kastritis","author_inst":"ZIK HALOMEM & Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg"},{"author_name":"Michael Levitt","author_inst":"Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akshay Bhumkar","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales and EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science"},{"author_name":"Dominic J.B.

Additionally, the isolation that results from social distancing may be harming well-being for families, as formal and informal supports become less accessible. For those with living with dementia and experiencing agitation, social distancing may be even harder to maintain, or social distancing could potentially aggravate dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. To understand the lived experience of social and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada we remotely interviewed 21 participants who normally attend a dementia specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, during a period where essential businesses were closed and healthcare had abruptly transitioned to telemedicine. The impacts of the public health measures in response to the pandemic emerged in three main categories of experience: 1) personal; 2) health services; and 3) health status (of both person living with dementia and care partner). This in-depth understanding of the needs and experiences of the pandemic for people living with dementia suggests that innovative means are urgently needed to facilitate provision of remote medicine and also social interaction and integration.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pamela Roach","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Angela Zwiers","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Emily Cox","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Karyn Fischer","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Anna Charlton","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Colin B Josephson","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Scott B Patten","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Dallas Seitz","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Zahinoor Ismail","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Eric E Smith","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"- Prompt Collaborators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Emma Sierecki","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Yann Gambin","author_inst":"EMBL Australia, The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Results: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-white. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%) and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (>70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p<0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p<0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22\/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. Conclusions: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcome in future outbreaks of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Oliver Van Oekelen","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Tarek Mouhieddine","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diane Marie Del Valle","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Joshua Richter","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Hearn Jay Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Shambavi Richard","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

It has been proposed that lockdown conditions disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain, requiring adaptation to treatment and care strategies. We investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N=431) relative to a healthy control group (N=88) using an online survey. In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised increases in perceived pain and psychological distress that would be mediated by pain catastrophizing. Survey questions answered during the lockdown period, probing patients self-perceived changes retrospectively, revealed that people with chronic pain perceived increases in their pain severity compared to before lockdown. They were also more adversely affected by lockdown compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise. Pain catastrophizing was found to be an important factor in predicting the extent of self-perceived increases in pain, and accounted for the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also independently predicted perceptions of increased pain. Interestingly, actual changes in pain symptoms (measured at two time points at pre- and post-lockdown in a subgroup, N = 85) did not change significantly on average, but those reporting increases also demonstrated greater baseline levels of pain catastrophizing. Overall, the findings suggest that remote pain management provision to target reduction of catastrophizing and increases to physical activity could be beneficial for chronic pain patients in overcoming the adverse effects of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Fallon","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Christopher Brown","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Hannah Twiddy","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Brian","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Frank","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Turo Nurmikko","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrej Stancak","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

The consequences of this rapid dispersion are under investigation. In this work, we analyzed thousands of genomes and protein sequences from Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. We show that the virus is a complex of slightly different variants that are unevenly distributed on Earth, and demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is spatially structured. Remarkably, the virus phylogeographic patterns were associated with ancestral amino acidic mutations. We hypothesize that geographic structuring is the result of founder effects occurring as a consequence of, and local evolution occurring after, long-distance dispersal.

Mortality rates from COVID by age, sex and ethnicity were used to attribute risk to GPs and the Index of Multiple Deprivation was used to determine socioeconomic distributions of the outcomes. Results: Of 45,858 GPs in our sample 3,632 (7.9%) were classified as high risk or very high risk. Of 6,771 GP practices in our sample 639 (9.4%) were identified as single-handed practices and of these 209 (32.7%) were run by a GP at high or very high risk. These 209 single-handed practices care for 710,043 patients. GPs at the highest levels of risk from COVID, and single-handed practices run by high-risk GPs were concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country. London had the highest proportion of both GPs and single-handed GP practices at very high risk of COVID mortality with 1,160 patients per 100,000 population registered to these practices. Conclusions: A significant proportion of GPs working in England, particularly those serving patients in the most deprived neighbourhoods, are at high risk of dying from COVID. Many of these GPs run single-handed practices. These GPs are particularly concentrated in London. There is an opportunity to provide additional support to mitigate COVID risk for GPs, GP practices and their patients. Failure to do so will likely exacerbate existing health inequalities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miqdad Asaria","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Fisher","author_inst":"The Health Foundation"},{"author_name":"Hannah Twiddy","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Brian","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Frank","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Turo Nurmikko","author_inst":"Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrej Stancak","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

A great concern around the globe now is to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic via contact tracing. Analyzing the control strategies during the first five months of 2020 in Singapore is important to estimate the effectiveness of contacting tracing measures. Methods. We developed a mathematical model to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in Singapore, with local cases stratified into 5 categories according to the conditions of contact tracing and self-awareness. Key parameters of each category were estimated from local surveillance data. We also simulated a set of possible scenarios to predict the effects of contact tracing and self-awareness for the following month. Findings. During January 23 - March 16, 2020, the success probabilities of contact tracing and self-awareness were estimated to be 31% (95% CI 28%-33%) and 54% (95% CI 51%-57%), respectively. During March 17 - April 7, 2020, several social distancing measures (e.g., limiting mass gathering) were introduced in Singapore, which, however, were estimated with minor contribution to reduce the non-tracing reproduction number per local case (R_(l,2)). If contact tracing and self-awareness cannot be further improved, we predict that the COVID-19 epidemic will continue to spread in Singapore if R_(l,2)[&ge;]1.5. Conclusion. Contact tracing and self-awareness can mitigate the COVID-19 transmission, and can be one of the key strategies to ensure a sustainable reopening after lifting the lockdown.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiuyang Huang","author_inst":"College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Yongjian Yang","author_inst":"College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China"},{"author_name":"Liping Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technology University, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Gaoxi Xiao","author_inst":"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technology University, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Andrej Stancak","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

Results: The majority of Covid-19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non-diabetics. Conclusions: Severe Covid-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid-19 suggests a previously unrecognized manifestation of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Smith","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppana","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Julie A Traupman","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Enrique Unson","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Daniel A Maddock","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"Kathy Y Chao","author_inst":"Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health"},{"author_name":"David P Dobesh","author_inst":"Saint Barnabas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ruth I Connor","author_inst":"Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

The potential biological benefits of ozonated autohemotherapy include reduced tissue hypoxia, decreased hypercoagulability, modulated immune function with inhibition of inflammatory mediators, improved phagocytic function, and impaired viral replication. Objective: To determine the impact of the use of ozonated blood on time to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: A Quasi-Randomized Controlled Trial determined by admittance to the hospital based on bed availability. Setting: Internal Medicine ward at Policlinica Ibiza Hospital, Spain. Participants: Eighteen patients with COVID-19 infection (laboratory confirmed) severe pneumonia admitted to hospital between 20th March and 19th April 2020. The mean age of the cohort was 68 years-old and 72% (n=13) were male. Intervention: Patients admitted to the hospital during the study period were pre-randomized to different beds based on bed availability. Depending on the bed the patient was admitted, the treatment was ozone autohemotherapy or standard treatment. Patients in the therapy arm received ozonated blood twice daily starting on the day of admission for a median of four days. Each treatment involved administration of 200 mL autologous whole blood enriched with 200 mL of oxygen-ozone mixture with a 40 g\/mL ozone concentration. Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was time from hospital admission to clinical improvement, which was defined as either hospital discharge or a two-point improvement in clinical status measured on a six-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were clinical improvement measured on the 7th, 14th and 28th day after admission, as well as time to a two-fold reduction in concentrations of C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. Results: Nine patients (50%) received ozonated autohemotherapy beginning on the day of admission. Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement (median [IQR]), 7 days [6-10] vs 28 days [8-31], p=0.04) and better outcomes at 14-days (88.8% vs 33.3%, p=0.01). In risk-adjusted analyses, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a shorter mean time to clinical improvement (-11.3 days, p=0.04, 95% CI -22.25 to -0.42). Conclusion: Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a significantly shorter time to clinical improvement in this quasi-randomized controlled trial. Given the small sample size and study design, these results require evaluation in larger randomized controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ALBERTO HERNANDEZ","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"MONTSERRAT VINALS","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"ASUNCION PABLOS","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"FRANCISCO VILAS","author_inst":"Policlinica Ibiza Hospital"},{"author_name":"PETER J PAPADAKOS","author_inst":"University of Rochester, NY"},{"author_name":"DUMINDA N WIJEYSUNDERA","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital, Toronto"},{"author_name":"SERGIO BERGESE","author_inst":"Stony Brook University, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"MARC VIVES","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Dr. J Trueta de Girona"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.

Objectives: We estimated the association between patients characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome in Mexico. Methods: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalization and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalization and adverse outcome. Results: Overall, 236,439 patients were included, with 89,756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalized and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalization and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. Conclusion: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodoros Giannouchos","author_inst":"Pharmacotherapy Outcomes Research Center, University of Utah Health, USA"},{"author_name":"Roberto Sussman","author_inst":"Institute of Nuclear Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Jose Manuel Mier","author_inst":"Institute of Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery, Angeles Lomas Hospital, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Poulas","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, University of Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Farsalinos","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, University of Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"DUMINDA N WIJEYSUNDERA","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital, Toronto"},{"author_name":"SERGIO BERGESE","author_inst":"Stony Brook University, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"MARC VIVES","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Dr. J Trueta de Girona"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Thippeshappa","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Maya Gough","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blakely","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Justin Ferdin","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carmen Bartley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica Callery","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mannino","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Klaffke","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Escareno","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy N Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vida Hodara","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Scordo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adelekan Oyejide","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dharani K.
