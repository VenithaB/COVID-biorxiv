The results showed that the most common mutation sites of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were located on the non-structural protein ORF1ab and the structural protein Spike. Further analysis revealed mutations in cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronavirus may help SARS-CoV-2 to escape cellular immunity under the long-term and large-scale community transmission. Meanwhile, the mutations on Spike protein may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and escape the recognition of B-cell immunity.

Using a Transcriptogram-based top-down approach, we identified three major, differentially-expressed gene sets comprising 219 mainly immune-response-related genes. We identified timescales for alterations in mitochondrial activity, signaling and transcription regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems and their relationship to viral titer. At the individual-gene level, EGR3 was significantly upregulated in infected cells. Similar activation in T-cells and fibroblasts in infected lung could explain the T-cell anergy and eventual fibrosis seen in SARS-CoV-1 infection. The methods can be applied to RNA data sets for SARS-CoV-2 to investigate the origin of differential responses in different tissue types, or due to immune or preexisting conditions or to compare cell culture, organoid culture, animal models and human-derived samples.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rita M.C. de Almeida","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Gilberto L Thomas","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"James A.

Drug repurposing is one of the most rapid strategies for addressing this need and numerous compounds have been selected for in vitro testing by several groups already. These have led to a growing database of molecules with in vitro activity against the virus. Machine learning models can assist drug discovery through prediction of the best compounds based on previously published data. Herein we have implemented several machine learning methods to develop predictive models from recent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro inhibition data and used them to prioritize additional FDA approved compounds for in vitro testing selected from our in-house compound library. From the compounds predicted with a Bayesian machine learning model, CPI1062 and CPI1155 showed antiviral activity in HeLa-ACE2 cell-based assays and represent potential repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. This approach can be greatly expanded to exhaustively virtually screen available molecules with predicted activity against this virus as well as a prioritization tool for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug discovery programs.

While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human noroviruses surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r2=0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D90 - dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21 and 28 J\/m2, respectively (with an estimated 18 J\/m2 as published for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D90 of 21 J\/m2 close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D90 values of 69.1, 89 and 77.6 J\/m2 for genogroups GI, GII and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D90 = 100 J\/m2 was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential nonpathogenic surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brahmaiah Pendyala","author_inst":"Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Ankit Patras","author_inst":"Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Doris DSouza","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Jean Bernatchez","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Sungjun Beck","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Nathan Beutler","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"James Ricketts","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Linlin Yang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Ana C Puhl","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kimberley M Zorn","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Thomas R Lane","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Andre S Godoy","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Glaucius Olivia","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jair L Siqueira-Neto","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Peter Madrid","author_inst":"SRI International"},{"author_name":"Sean Ekins","author_inst":"Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.154286","rel_title":"Comparing library preparation methods for SARS-CoV-2 multiplex amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.154286","rel_abs":"Genomic surveillance has a key role in tracking the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but information on how different sequencing library preparation approaches affect the data produced are lacking.

We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT, which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating reads had no effect on the downstream analysis. We found some examples of library preparation-specific differences in minority variant calling. Overall our data shows that the choice of Illumina library preparation method has minimal effects on consensus base calling and downstream phylogenetic analysis, and suggests that all methods would be suitable for use if specific reagents are difficult to obtain.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Batty","author_inst":"Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global "},{"author_name":"Theerarat Kochakarn","author_inst":"Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine Unit (GEM), Center of Excellence in Malaria Research, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and"},{"author_name":"Arporn Wangwiwatsin","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Khajohn Joonlasak","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Angkana T.

Methods: In this retrospective study, 1,206 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and followed-up by telephone call one month after discharged from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, symptoms, and numerical rating scale scores (0-10) of nasal symptoms were extracted from the hospital medical records, and confirmed or reevaluated by the telephone follow-up. Results: From COVID-19 patients (N = 1,172) completing follow-up, 199 (17%) subjects had severe COVID-19 and 342 (29.2%) reported nasal symptoms. The most common nasal symptom was loss of taste (20.6%, median score = 6), while 11.4% had loss of smell (median score = 5). The incidence of nasal symptom including loss of smell and loss of taste as the first onset symptom was <1% in COVID-19 patients. Loss of smell or taste scores showed no correlation with the scores of other nasal symptoms. Loss of taste scores, but not loss of smell scores, were significantly increased in severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-6 and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels positively correlated with loss of taste scores. About 80% of COVID-19 patients recovered from smell and taste dysfunction in 2 weeks. Conclusion: In the Wuhan COVID-19 cohort, only 1 out of 10 hospital admitted patients had loss of smell while 1 out 5 reported loss of taste which was associated to severity of COVID-19. Most patients recovered smell and taste dysfunctions in 2 weeks.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Song","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ke Deng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hai Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Chao Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Liao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jin Ma","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chao He","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Li Pan","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Isam Alobid","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"De-Yun Wang","author_inst":"Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ming Zeng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Mullol","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERES"},{"author_name":"Zheng Liu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Insee Sensorn","author_inst":"Center for Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Somnuek Sungkanuparph","author_inst":"Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Samut Prakan, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Ekawat Pasomsub","author_inst":"Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Chonticha Klungthong","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Thanat Chookajorn","author_inst":"Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine Unit (GEM), Center of Excellence in Malaria Research, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Wasun Chantratita","author_inst":"Center for Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"otolaryngology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129981","rel_title":"A discrete-time-evolution model to forecast progress of Covid-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-06-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129981","rel_abs":"Based on well-known infection models, we constructed a new model to forecast the propagation of the Covid-19 pandemic which yields a discrete-time evolution with one day interval.

The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). One advantage of the model is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands).

To overcome this, we constructed an ACE2-human IgG1 fusion protein with mutations in the catalytic domain of ACE2. This fusion protein contained a LALA mutation that abrogates Fcr{gamma} binding, but retains FcRN binding to prolong the half-life, as well as achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lung lavage. Interestingly, a mutation in the catalytic domain of ACE2, MDR504, completely abrogated catalytic activity, but significantly increased binding to SARS-CoV2 spike protein in vitro. This feature correlated with more potent viral neutralization in a plaque assay. Parental administration of the protein showed stable serum concentrations with a serum half-life of [~] 145 hours with excellent bioavailability in the epithelial lining fluid of the lung.

This may be due in large part to the unclear immunopathological basis for the development of immune dysregulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe and critical patients. Specifically, it remains unknown whether the immunological features of the disease that have been identified so far are compartment-specific responses or general features of COVID-19. Additionally, readily detectable biological markers correlated with strata of disease severity that could be used to triage patients and inform treatment options have not yet been identified. Here, we leveraged publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to elucidate the common and compartment-specific immunological features of clinically severe COVID-19. We identified a number of transcriptional programs that are altered across the spectrum of disease severity, few of which are common between the lung and peripheral immune environments. In the lung, comparing severe and moderate patients revealed severity-specific responses of enhanced interferon, A20\/I{kappa}B, IL-2, and IL-6 pathway signatures along with broad signaling activity of IFNG, SPP1, CCL3, CCL8, and IL18 across cell types. These signatures contrasted with features unique to ARDS observed in the blood compartment, which included depletion of interferon and A20\/I{kappa}B signatures and a lack of IL-6 response. The cell surface marker S1PR1 was strongly upregulated in patients diagnosed with ARDS compared to non-ARDS patients in {gamma}{delta} T cells of the blood compartment, and we nominate S1PR1 as a potential marker for immunophenotyping ARDS in COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICOVID-19 disease severity is associated with a number of compositional shifts in the cellular makeup of the blood and lung environments.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptional data suggest differentially expressed cell surface proteins as markers for COVID-19 immunophenotyping from BALF and PBMC samples.\nC_LIO_LISeverity-specific features COVID-19 manifest at the pathway level, suggesting distinct changes to epithelia and differences between local and systemic immune dynamics.\nC_LIO_LIImmune-epithelial cellular communication analysis identifies ligands implicated in transcriptional regulation of proto-oncogenes in the lung epithelia of severe COVID-19 patients.\nC_LIO_LINetwork analysis suggests broadly-acting dysregulatory ligands in the pulmonary microenvironment as candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of severe COVID-19.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kalon J.

These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera.

We also evaluate the specificity of S protein-mediated host cell binding by examining interactions with proposed binding partners in the human secretome. In addition, the antigenicity of these proteins is demonstrated by standard ELISAs, and in a flexible protein microarray format.

Observed effects on the central nervous system includes neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-COV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is expressed throughout various caliber vessels in the frontal cortex. Additionally, ACE2 was also detectable in primary human brain microvascular endothelial (hBMVEC) maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis for cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48hr exposure window. However, when the viral spike proteins were introduced into model systems that recapitulate the essential features of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), breach to the barrier was evident in various degrees depending on the spike protein subunit tested. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluid model of the human BBB, a platform that most closely resembles the human physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Subsequent analysis also showed the ability for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tetyana P Buzhdygan","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Brandon J DeOre","author_inst":"Rowan University"},{"author_name":"Abigail Baldwin-Leclair","author_inst":"Rowan University"},{"author_name":"Hannah McGary","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Roshanak Razmpour","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Peter A Galie","author_inst":"Rowan University"},{"author_name":"Raghava Potula","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Allison M Andrews","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Servio Heybert Ramirez","author_inst":"The Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"},{"author_name":"Laura Y Yen","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Alex J Noble","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Mykhailo Kopylov","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey B Bonanno","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Garrett-Thomson","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David B Hayes","author_inst":"Intl Solidarity of Scientists LLC"},{"author_name":"Robert H Bortz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ariel S Wirchniaski","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Catalina Florez","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Ethan Laudermilch","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"J Maximilian Fels","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"M Eugenia Dieterle","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit K Jangra","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Amanda Mengotto","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna P Daily","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liise-anne Pirofski","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kartik Chandran","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Brenowitz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott J Garforth","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward T Eng","author_inst":"New York Structural Biology Center"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R Lai","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Steven C Almo","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.151647","rel_title":"Genome-wide mapping of therapeutically-relevant SARS-CoV-2 RNA structures","rel_date":"2020-06-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.151647","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a linear single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of [~]30 kb, whose outbreak caused the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The ability of coronaviruses to rapidly evolve, adapt, and cross species barriers makes the development of effective and durable therapeutic strategies a challenging and urgent need. As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of functionally conserved structural elements within coronavirus RNA genomes have been identified to date.\n\nHere, we performed RNA structure probing by SHAPE-MaP to obtain a single-base resolution secondary structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome. The SHAPE-MaP probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5' UTR, ribosomal frameshifting element, and 3' UTR), and reveal new structures. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of highly-structured regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowed for the identification of several putative druggable pockets. Furthermore, [~]8% of the identified structure elements show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role. In addition, we identify a set of persistently single-stranded regions having high sequence conservation, suitable for the development of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.\n\nCollectively, our work lays the foundation for the development of innovative RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-related infections.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ilaria Manfredonia","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Chandran Nithin","author_inst":"International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (Warsaw)"},{"author_name":"Almudena Ponce-Salvatierra","author_inst":"International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (Warsaw)"},{"author_name":"Pritha Ghosh","author_inst":"Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Protein Engineering, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Tomasz K.

Here we describe the development of a semi-quantitative high-content microscopy-based assay for detection of three major classes (IgG, IgA and IgM) of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human samples. The possibility to detect antibodies against the entire viral proteome together with a robust semi-automated image analysis workflow resulted in specific, sensitive and unbiased assay which complements the portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays.

A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural observations.

The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges, and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined at SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of EVALI.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thivanka Muthumalage","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lucas","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Qixin Wang","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lamb","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Mathew McGraw","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Irfan Rahman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Kishigami","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Takamasa Ueno","author_inst":"Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University"},{"author_name":"Yasumasa Iwatani","author_inst":"Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kenzo Tokunaga","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Wolf","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cerikan Berati","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

Since then scientists all over the world are engaged in developing new vaccines, antibodies, or drug molecules to combat this new threat. Here in this work, we performed an in-silico analysis on the protein-protein interactions between the receptor-binding (RBD) domain of viral SPIKE protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to highlight the key alteration that happened from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed and compared the molecular differences between these two viruses by using various computational approaches such as binding affinity calculations, computational alanine, and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding affinity calculations show SARS-CoV-2 binds little more firmly to the hACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV. Analysis of simulation trajectories reveals that enhanced hydrophobic contacts or the van der Waals interaction play a major role in stabilizing the protein-protein interface. The major finding obtained from molecular dynamics simulations is that the RBD-ACE2 interface is populated with water molecules and interacts strongly with both RBD and ACE2 interfacial residues during the simulation periods. We also emphasize that the interfacial water molecules play a critical role in binding and maintaining the stability of the RBD\/hACE2 complex. The water-mediated hydrogen bond by the bridge water molecules is crucial for stabilizing the RBD and ACE2 domains. The structural and dynamical features presented here may serve as a guide for developing new drug molecules, vaccines, or antibodies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Malik","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Dwarakanath Prahlad","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Naveen Kulkarni","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Abhijit Kayal","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Mathew McGraw","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Irfan Rahman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Kishigami","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Takamasa Ueno","author_inst":"Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University"},{"author_name":"Yasumasa Iwatani","author_inst":"Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kenzo Tokunaga","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Wolf","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cerikan Berati","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zharko Daniloski","author_inst":"New York Genome Center and NYU"},{"author_name":"Tristan X.

Among these alternatives is collection of nasal-swab samples, which can be performed by the patient, avoiding the need for healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment. Previous studies have reached opposing conclusions regarding whether nasal sampling is concordant or discordant with NP. To resolve this disagreement, we compared nasal and NP specimens collected by healthcare workers in a cohort consisting of individuals clinically suspected of COVID-19 and outpatients known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive undergoing follow-up. We investigated three different transport conditions, including traditional viral transport media (VTM) and dry swabs, for each of two different nasal-swab collection protocols on a total of 308 study participants, and compared categorical results and Ct values to those from standard NP swabs collected at the same time from the same patients. All testing was performed by RT-PCR on the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RealTime EUA (limit of detection [LoD], 100 copies viral genomic RNA\/mL transport medium). We found high concordance (Cohen's kappa >0.8) only for patients with viral loads above 1,000 copies\/mL. Those with viral loads below 1,000 copies\/mL, the majority in our cohort, exhibited low concordance (Cohen's kappa = 0.49); most of these would have been missed by nasal testing alone. Previous reports of high concordance may have resulted from use of assays with higher LoD ([&ge;]1,000 copies\/mL). These findings counsel caution in use of nasal testing in healthcare settings and contact-tracing efforts, as opposed to screening of asymptomatic, low-prevalence, low-risk populations. Nasal testing is an adjunct, not a replacement, for NP.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cody Callahan","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rose Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ghee Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kate E Zulauf","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Kirby","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ramy Arnaout","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Neville E Sanjana","author_inst":"New York Genome Center and NYU"},{"author_name":"Takamasa Ueno","author_inst":"Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University"},{"author_name":"Yasumasa Iwatani","author_inst":"Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kenzo Tokunaga","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Wolf","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cerikan Berati","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

Ecuador was the second country in South America to report confirmed cases. The first case reported in Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, was a tourist who came from the Netherlands and presented symptoms on March 10th, 2020 (index case). In this work we used the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence the metagenome of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from this case reported, and subsequently we sequenced the whole genome of the index case and other three patients using the ARTIC network protocols. Our data from the metagenomic approach confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coexisting with pathogenic bacteria suggesting coinfection. Relevant bacteria found in the BAL metagenome were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus and Chlamydia spp. Lineage assignment of the four whole genomes revealed three different origins. The variant HEE-01 was imported from the Netherlands and was assigned to B lineage, HGSQ-USFQ-018, belongs to the B.1 lineage showing nine nucleotide differences with the reference strain and grouped with sequences from the United Kingdom, and HGSQ-USFQ-007 and HGSQ-USFQ-010 belong to the B lineage and grouped with sequences from Scotland. All genomes show mutations in their genomes compared to the reference strain, which could be important to understand the virulence, severity and transmissibility of the virus. Our findings also suggest that there were at least three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Ecuador.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sully Marquez","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Belen Prado-Vivar","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Guadalupe","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Laboratorio de Biotecnologia Vegetal"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez Granja","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Manuel Jibaja","author_inst":"Hospital Eugenio Espejo, Quito"},{"author_name":"Milton Tobar","author_inst":"Hospital Eugenio Espejo, Quito"},{"author_name":"Francisco Mora","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Juan Gaviria","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Maria Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Edison Ligna","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Franklin Espinosa","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Jorge Reyes","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Veronica Barragan","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Patricio Rojas-Silva","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Trueba","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Michelle Grunauer","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Escuela de Medicina, COCSA"},{"author_name":"Paul Cardenas","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Marina Lusic","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Integrative Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steeve Boulant","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany and Research Group Cellular polarity and viral infection, Germa"},{"author_name":"Megan Stanifer","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany and Research Group Cellular polarity and viral infect"},{"author_name":"Ralf Bartenschlager","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg,"},{"author_name":"Fred A.

Using published data from various sources it is shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is highly likely to be susceptible to UV damage while suspended in air irradiated by UV-C at levels that are acceptable and safe for upper-room applications. This is while humans are present in the room. Both the expected and worst-case scenarios are investigated to show the efficacy of the upper-room UV-C approach to reduce COVID-19 air transmission in a confined space with moderate but sufficient height.

COVID-19 case\/death counts in the state where respondents work was used to test associations between contextual status and decreases in weekly appointments, fear of contracting COVID-19 at work, and current work status (alpha=0.05). Over 10 days, 3,122 responses were received, with region, gender, and age distributions similar to those of dentists in Brazil. Work status was affected for 94% of dentists, with less developed regions being more impacted. The impact on routine was high or very high for 84%, leading to varied changes to clinic infrastructure, personal protective equipment use, patient screening, and increased costs. COVID-19 patients had been seen by 5.3% of respondents, and 90% reported fearing contracting COVID-19 at work. Multilevel statistics showed that greater case and death rates (1000 cases or 100 deaths per million inhabitants) in one's state increased the odds of being fearful of contracting the disease (by 18% and 25%). For each additional 1000 cases or 100 deaths, the odds of currently not working or treating emergencies increased by 36% and 58%. The reduction in patients seen weekly per dentist was greater in public (38.7+\/-18.6) than in private clinics (22.5+\/-17.8). This study provides early evidence of three major impacts of the pandemic on dentistry in Brazil: increasing inequalities due to coverage differences between public and private networks; adoption of new clinical routines, which are associated with an economic burden; and associations of regional COVID-19 incidence and mortality with fear of contracting the disease at work.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael R Moraes","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Marcos B Correa","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Ana B Queiroz","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Andrea Daneris","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Joao P Lopes","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Pereira-Cenci","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Otavio P D'Avila","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Maximiliano S Cenci","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Giana S Lima","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Flavio F Demarco","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Yingdong Gao","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ruisheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"qianghu wang","author_inst":"Nanjing medical university"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Michelle Grunauer","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Escuela de Medicina, COCSA"},{"author_name":"Paul Cardenas","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Marina Lusic","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Integrative Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steeve Boulant","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany and Research Group Cellular polarity and viral infection, Germa"},{"author_name":"Megan Stanifer","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany and Research Group Cellular polarity and viral infect"},{"author_name":"Ralf Bartenschlager","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany and German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg,"},{"author_name":"Fred A.
