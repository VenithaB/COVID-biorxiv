Methods: We did a cross-sectional point prevalence survey, which was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We included a pre-determined number of centers based on each country population: five to ten EDs for countries with > 20 million inhabitants and one to five EDs for the other countries. ED directors or named delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice in use one month after the outbreak in Northern Italy. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data. Results: Overall 102 centers from 18 countries completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items. COVID-19 positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms. Conclusion: We identified variability and gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. Early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as key factors that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Bressan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Danilo Buonsenso","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Uinversitario A.

And most countries with significant outbreaks had introduced social distancing or \"lockdown\" measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how, and to what extent, these measures can be lifted. By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 29th April 2020, and covered 73 countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling. The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions - R0 0.77 (95%CI 0.68-0.87), based on cases and 0.78 (95%CI 0.68-0.88) based on mortality. Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Lonergan","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"James Chalmers","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Ruth Farrugia","author_inst":"Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta"},{"author_name":"Niccolo' Parri","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Meyer Firenze, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rianne Oostenbrink","author_inst":"Erasmus MC - Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luigi Titomanlio","author_inst":"Hospital Universitaire Robert-Debre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Damian Roland","author_inst":"Leicester Hospitals, Leister, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruud Nijman","author_inst":"St. Mary's hospital - Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"St. Mary's hospital - Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Liviana Da Dalt","author_inst":"University of Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Santiago Mintegi","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Cruces, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080895","rel_title":"Elementary spatial structures and dispersion of COVID-19: health geography directing responses to public health emergency in Sao Paulo State, Brazil","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080895","rel_abs":"Public health policies to contain the spread of COVID-19 rely mainly on non-pharmacological measures.

However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in those municipalities. In this ecological study, we use geographical models of population mobility as patterns for spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Based on surveillance data, we identify two patterns: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area and other that is hierarchical, with long-distance spread through major highways to cities of regional relevance. We also modelled the impact of social distancing strategies in the most relevant cities, and estimated a beneficial effect in each and every setting studied.

Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and preventative options are undertaken globally. Objectives: We summarised all currently registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the retrieved interventional studies. Data sources: The ClinicalTrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched. Study eligibility criteria: Registered clinical trials examining treatment and\/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included. No language, country or study design restrictions were applied. Withdrawn, cancelled studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or preventative strategies for COVID-19 were excluded. Participants and interventions: No restrictions in terms of participants' age and medical background or type of intervention were enforced. Methods: The registries were searched using the term \"coronavirus\" or \"COVID-19\" from their inception until 26th March 2020. Additional manual search of the registries was also performed. Eligible studies were summarised and tabulated. Interventional trials were methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access studies and trials testing Traditional Chinese Medicine. Results: In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 studies assessing preventive strategies and 3 studies examining both were retrieved. Interventional treatment studies were mostly randomised (n=150, 76%) and open-label (n=73, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 (IQR 40-200). Major categories of interventions that are currently being investigated are discussed. Conclusion: Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Summarised data on these trials will assist physicians and researchers to promote patient care and guide future research efforts for COVID-19 pandemic containment. However, up to the end of March, 2020, significant information concerning reported trials was lacking.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paraskevi C.

Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual's phone establishes bluetooth contact with the phone of an infected person. We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of binary \"infected\" or \"uninfected\" statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated. In the real world, where most known-infected persons are isolated or quarantined and where many individuals may not carry their mobiles in public, we believe the improvement offered by our method warrants consideration. Importantly, in view of widespread concerns on privacy and contact-tracing, our method relies mainly on direct contact data that can be stored locally on users' phones, and uses limited communication via intermediary servers only upon testing, mitigating privacy concerns.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vishwesha Guttal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Krishna","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Rahul Siddharthan","author_inst":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Charalampos D.

The disease of transmissible person-to-person pneumonia caused by the extreme acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-COV-2, also known as COVID-19), has sparked a global warning. Thermal screening, quarantining, and later lockdown were methods employed by various nations to contain the spread of the virus. Though exercising various possible plans to contain the spread help in mitigating the effect of COVID-19, projecting the rise and preparing to face the crisis would help in minimizing the effect. In the scenario, this study attempts to use Machine Learning tools to forecast the possible rise in number of cases by considering the data of daily new cases. To capture the uncertainty, three different techniques: (i) Decision Tree algorithm, (ii) Support Vector Machine algorithm, and (iii) Gaussian process regression are used to project the data and capture the possible deviation. Based on the projection of new cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, medical facilities, population density, number of test conducted, and facilities of services, are considered to define the criticality index (CI). CI is used to classify all the districts of country in the regions of high risk, low risk and moderate risk. An online dashpot is created which updates the data on daily bases for next four weeks. The prospective suggestions of this study would aid in planning the strategies to apply the lockdown\/ any other plan for any country, which can take other parameters to define the CI.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshay Kumar","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani Campus, Rajasthan, 333031, India"},{"author_name":"Farhan Mohammad Khan","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani Campus, Rajasthan, 333031, India"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani Campus, Rajasthan, 333031, India"},{"author_name":"Harish Puppala","author_inst":"BML Munjal University"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Hannah Janocha","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Universities of Giessen and Marburg Lung Centre (UGMLC), Philipps University Marburg, German Centre for Lung Research (DZL) Ma"},{"author_name":"Emmanouil Karofylakis","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"France Mentr\u00e9","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Chrysanthi Skevaki","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Universities of Giessen and Marburg Lung Centre (UGMLC), Philipps University Marburg, German Centre for Lung Research (DZL) Ma"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Laou\u00e9nan","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20079962","rel_title":"Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 Outbreak and Counter-Measures in France","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20079962","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic has triggered world-wide attention among data scientists and epidemiologists to analyze and predict the outcomes, by using previous statistical epidemic models.

To this end, we introduced an exposure factor, called {beta}1\/{beta}2, which allows us to describe the influence of factors such as social isolation on dispersal from disease. The results also corroborate a phenomenon observed in countries that registered a high growth in cases in short period of time, to example of Italy, Spain and USA: if isolation measures are imposed late, the total number of cases explodes when the epidemic is approaching from peak, which implies a higher exposure rate in the first days of case registration.From the data collected, we made the linear adjustment of the infected curve according to the time between the 41st and 74th days since the official notification of the first case and we obtained a high infection rate in the period, close to 4.0. The result indicates that the relaxation of social exclusion measures contributed to the high increase in cases in the period. This result reinforces the adoption of the model that differentiates unexposed susceptible from those that are most exposed to contagion. The model also predicts that the peak epidemic outbreak in Brazil, based on the number of cases, will occur around in late May and early June.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Augusto S.

Having identified the RNA extraction step as one of the key bottlenecks, we tested several alternatives that avoid the use of commercial kits for this step. The analysis showed that 2-propanol precipitation of the viral RNA, followed by one-step RT-qPCR results in a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that provided currently by automatized systems such as the COBAS 6800 system. Therefore, this simple protocol allows SARS-CoV-2 testing independently of commercial kit providers in a time and cost-effective manner. It can be readily implemented in research and\/or diagnostic laboratories worldwide, provided that patient confidentiality and researcher safety are ensured. Scaling up the testing capabilities of hospitals and research facilities will identify larger numbers of infected individuals to paint a clear picture of the COVID-19 prevalence, a pre-requisite for informed policy decision making.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xabier Guruceaga","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Amanda Sierra","author_inst":"Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Daniel Marino","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Izortze Santin","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Jon Ander Nieto-Garai","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Jose Ramon Bilbao","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Maier Lorizate","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aspichueta","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"},{"author_name":"coBIG (COVID19 Basque Inter-institutional Group)","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ugo Mayor","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Laou\u00e9nan","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080846","rel_title":"Spatial-temporal variations of atmospheric factors contribute to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080846","rel_abs":"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reached over two million confirmed cases worldwide, and numbers are still growing at a fast rate. The majority of new infections are now being reported outside of China, where the outbreak officially originated in December 2019 in Wuhan. Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries\/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stem from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We propose that air pollutants, and specifically particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and ozone, are oppositely related with the SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency and could serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raffaele Fronza","author_inst":"Genewerk GmbH, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marina Lusic","author_inst":"Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany; German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Manfred Schmidt","author_inst":"Genewerk GmbH, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bojana Lucic","author_inst":"Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany;  German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jon Ander Nieto-Garai","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Jose Ramon Bilbao","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Maier Lorizate","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country UPV\/EHU"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aspichueta","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"},{"author_name":"coBIG (COVID19 Basque Inter-institutional Group)","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Ugo Mayor","author_inst":"University of the Basque Country EHU\/UPV"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Laou\u00e9nan","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080796","rel_title":"COVID-19 severe pneumonia in Mexico City - First experience in a Mexican hospital","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080796","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic since its first confirmed case, has changed the world. The need for accurate and truthful information is vital. Mexico and Latin America have been widely affected, so having local epidemiological data, will be of great clinical utility. Methods: A total of 33 hospitalized patients with Covid-19 pneumonia (either severe or critical) were identified from electronic health record in a third level care private hospital in Mexico City from March 13rd to April 13rd, 2020. We conducted a descriptive study of patients for characterization of the clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, as well as complications. Results: The mean age was 60.6 (12.68) years and 23 (69.7%) were males. Twenty-three patients (69.6%) were overweight or obese. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 7 days. All the patients required mechanical invasive ventilation. The median duration of the mechanical ventilation was 12(2.6) days and all patients were extubated except one. All patients were started on antiviral treatment in the first 24 hours after admission once the diagnosis of Covid19 pneumonia was made. There was no difference between the treatment option and the length of stay. The extubation rate was higher (91.6%) than in other series, with no fatalities even though they were treated with different regimens. Conclusions: This one-centre experience describes the epidemiology, treatment and outcome of 33 patients with severe or critical COVID pneumonia admitted to the ICU. Most patients in our series were overweight or obese male, which we observed were of higher risk to present critical pneumonia, as well as high levels of Interleukin-6. The foregoing is relevant, due to the high incidence of these comorbidities in our country.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Valente-Acosta","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Irma Hoyo-Ulloa","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luis Espinosa-Aguilar","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raquel Mendoza-Aguilar","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Javier Garcia-Guerrero","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Diego Ontanon-Zurita","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brenda Gomez-Gomez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Omar Fueyo-Rodriguez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Juan Mauricio Vera-Zertuche","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rodolfo Anzola-Arias","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jose Victor Jimenez-Ceja","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Daniela Horta-Capinteyro","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Claudia Olvera-Guzman","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Janet Aguirre-Sanchez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Juvenal Franco-Granillo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura Jauregui-Camargo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Sada-Diaz","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rafael Saavedra-Perez-Salas","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andres Palomar-Lever","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Francisco Moreno-Sanchez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20076422","rel_title":"Pooled testing with replication: a mass testing strategy for the COVID-19 pandemics","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20076422","rel_abs":"In absence of a vaccine or antiviral drugs for the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes urgent to test for positiveness to the virus as many people as possible, in order to detect early outbreaks of the infection.

This approach is limited by the availability of reactants, trained technicians and laboratories. To speed up the testing procedures, some attempts have been done on group testing, which means that the swabs of multiple patients are grouped together and tested. Here we propose to use this technique in conjunction with a combinatorial replication scheme in which each patient is allocated in two or more groups to reduce total numbers of tests and to allow testing of even larger numbers of people.

However, data on PCR-based tests for similar viruses show that PCR-based testing produces enough false positive results to make positive results highly unreliable over a broad range of real-world scenarios. This has clinical and case management implications, and affects an array of epidemiological statistics, including the asymptomatic ratio, prevalence, and hospitalization and death rates.

We hypothesised that if patients treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or AT1 receptor blockers (ARB) were more prone to SARS-CoV2 infection and had a worse prognosis than untreated patients, the prevalence of consumption of these drugs would be higher in patients with COVID-19 compared to the general population. Methods and results: We used a clinical epidemiology approach based on the estimation of standardised prevalence ratio (SPR) of consumption of ACEI and ARB in four groups of patients (including 187 COVID-19 positive) with increasing severity referred to the University hospital of Lille and in three French reference samples (the exhaustive North population (n=1,569,968), a representative sample of the French population (n=414,046), a random sample of Lille area (n=1,584)). The SPRs of ACEI and ARB did not differ as the severity of the COVID-19 patients increased, being similar to the regular consumption of these drugs in the North of France population with the same non-significant increase for both treatment (1.17 [0.83-1.67]). A statistically significant increase in the SPR of ARB (1.56 [1.02-2.39]) was observed in intensive care unit patients only. After stratification on obesity, this increase was limited to the high risk subgroup of obese patients. Conclusions: Our results strongly support the recommendation that ACEI and ARB should be continued in the population and in COVID-19 positive patients, reinforcing the position of several scientific societies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luc Dauchet","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases and CHU Lille Depart"},{"author_name":"Marc Lambert","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases and CHU Lille Intern"},{"author_name":"Victoria Gauthier","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases"},{"author_name":"Julien Poissy","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Karine Faure","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Infectious Diseases and Univ Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1019-UMR9017-CIIL-Centre d'Infection et d'Immun"},{"author_name":"Alain Facon","author_inst":"CHU Lille SAMU59 and Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9cile Yelnik","author_inst":"CHU Lille Internal Medicine Department"},{"author_name":"Sophie Panaget","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Thierry Plagnieux","author_inst":"DRSM Hauts de France, F-59009 Villeneuve d'Ascq"},{"author_name":"Florent Verfaillie","author_inst":"DRSM Hauts de France, F-59009 Villeneuve d'Ascq"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mathieu","author_inst":"CHU Lille Department of Intensive Care"},{"author_name":"Patrick Goldstein","author_inst":"CHU Lille SAMU59 and Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Aline Meirhaeghe","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging Related Diseases"},{"author_name":"Philippe Amouyel","author_inst":"Univ Lille, Inserm, CHU de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Ageing Related Diseases and CHU Lille Depar"},{"author_name":"Juvenal Franco-Granillo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura Jauregui-Camargo","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Sada-Diaz","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rafael Saavedra-Perez-Salas","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andres Palomar-Lever","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Francisco Moreno-Sanchez","author_inst":"The American British Cowdray Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.072652","rel_title":"Molecular Architecture of Early Dissemination and Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in Metropolitan Houston, Texas","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.072652","rel_abs":"We sequenced the genomes of 320 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. These genomes were from the viruses causing infections in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic affecting Houston. Substantial viral genomic diversity was identified, which we interpret to mean that the virus was introduced into Houston many times independently by individuals who had traveled from different parts of the country and the world. The majority of viruses are apparent progeny of strains derived from Europe and Asia. We found no significant evidence of more virulent viral types, stressing the linkage between severe disease, underlying medical conditions, and perhaps host genetics. We discovered a signal of selection acting on the spike protein, the primary target of massive vaccine efforts worldwide. The data provide a critical resource for assessing virus evolution, the origin of new outbreaks, and the effect of host immune response.\n\nSignificanceCOVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a global pandemic.

Some amino acid replacements in the spike protein suggest positive immune selection is at work in shaping variation in this protein. Our analysis traces the early molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in Houston, and will help us to understand the origin and trajectory of future infection spikes.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S.

However, without reaching herd immunity, the return of epidemic is possible. We investigate the impact of population structure, case importation, asymptomatic cases, and the number of contacts on a possible second wave of epidemic through mathematical modelling. Methods: we built a modified Susceptible-exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model with parameters mirroring those of the COVID-19 pandemic and reported simulated characteristics of epidemics for incidence, hospitalizations and deaths under different scenarios. Results: A larger percent of old people leads to higher number of hospitalizations, while a large percent of prior infection will effectively curb the epidemic. The number of imported cases and the speed of importation have small impact on the epidemic progression. However, a higher percent of asymptomatic cases slows the epidemic down and reduces the number of hospitalizations and deaths at the epidemic peak. Finally, reducing the number of contacts among young people alone has moderate effects on themselves, but little effects on the old population. However, reducing the number of contacts among old people alone can mitigate the epidemic significantly in both groups, even though young people remain active within themselves. Conclusion: Reducing the number of contacts among high risk populations alone can mitigate the burden of epidemic in the whole society. Interventions targeting high risk groups may be more effective in containing or mitigating the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhua Yu","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Randall J.

We have developed a fundamental spreading model for the COVID-19 epidemic that has two parameters: the community transmission rate and a metric describing the degree of isolation and social distancing in a given community or region (country, state, county, or city). These two parameters are calibrated to data from the community, so the model uncertainty depends on the quality of the data and ability to test for COVID-19. The model shows that social distancing significantly reduces the epidemic spread and flattens the curve. The model predicts well the spreading trajectory and peak time of new infections for a community of any size and provides an upper estimate for the total number of infections and daily new infection rate for weeks into the future, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic. The theory has immediate and far-reaching applications for ongoing outbreaks or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baolian Cheng","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ming Wang","author_inst":"Retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Paul A.

Using Twitter data, we aim to (1) define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in a spatiotemporal context and (2) examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets. We analyzed a total of 259,529 unique tweets containing \"coronavirus\" from 115,485 unique users between January 23, 2020 and March 24, 2020 that were identified by the Twitter API as English and U.S.-based. Tweets containing specified keywords (determined a priori) were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. Tweets about social disruptiveness were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. Social distancing tweets became overall more prevalent in the U.S. from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. In January and February, facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, which were among the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the \"implementation\" and \"negative emotions\" facets of social distancing largely dominated in combination with topics of \"social disruption\" and \"adaptation\", albeit to a lesser degree. Social distancing can be defined in terms of facets that respond and represent certain moments and events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising COVID-19 case counts. For example, in February, Miami, FL had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March which corresponded with the rise of COVID-19 cases in the city. This suggests that overall volume of social distancing tweets can reflect the relative case count in respective locations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiye Kwon","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Connor Grady","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Josemari T.

Due to the unknown nature of the disease and the lack of specific drugs, several potential treatments were used for patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate studies of the effects of Favipiravir in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases including LitCovid hub, PubMed, Scopus, ISI web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Embase using keywords related to COVID-19 and Favipiravir. We will search the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We will also search for clinical trial registries, such as clinicaltrial.gov for the ongoing clinical trials. Two investigators (MAZ and SH) will independently screen titles, abstracts, and full-text of included studies based on eligibility criteria. These investigators will also independently extract data and appraise the quality of studies. All potential discrepancies will be resolved through consultation with the third reviewer. Data synthesis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3) or CMA (version 2). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard I2 test. A funnel plot, Egger test, and Begg test will be used for asymmetry to explore possible publication bias. Ethics and dissemination The findings of this systematic review with proportional meta-analysis will help to identify the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir for COVID-19 patients.

The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process. Methods: Publicly available data for the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths and weather were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers (Rt) based on retrospective moving average were used to explore the trends. Student t tests were used to compare temperature and peak Rt cross-sectionally. Results: We found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), had declined since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a Rt of 1 or below after April 15, 2020. However, the Rts remained around 1 for most areas since then and some small and short rebounds were presented in some areas, suggesting a persistent epidemic in those areas. The timing of the main decline was concurrent with the implementation of mitigating interventions. Cities with warm temperature also tended to have a lower peak Rt than that of cities with cold temperature. However, large geographic variations existed. Conclusions: Aggressive interventions might have mitigated the current epidemic of COVID-19, while temperature might have some weak effects on the virus transmission.

The antiviral properties of naproxen, belonging to the NSAID family, previously demonstrated against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV2 was shown by molecular modeling. In VeroE6 cells and reconstituted human primary respiratory epithelium models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, naproxen inhibited viral replication and protected the bronchial epithelia against SARS-CoV-2 induced-damage. The benefit of naproxen addition to the standard of care is tested in an on-going clinical study.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olivier Terrier","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Dilly","author_inst":"INSERM  and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Mario-Andres Pizzorno","author_inst":"Lyon I University, CIRI, INSERM 1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Julien Henri","author_inst":"Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique CNRS UMR 8226"},{"author_name":"Francis Berenbaum","author_inst":"Sorbonne University, INSERM, CRSA UMR S_938, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Lyon I University, CIRI, INSERM U 1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Bruno Feve","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne Universitu CRSA UMR S_938, AP-HP, ICAN"},{"author_name":"Frederic Adnet","author_inst":"AP-HP, SAMU, Avicenne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michele Sabbah","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calavatra","author_inst":"University Lyon I, CIRI, INSERM U1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Vincent Marechal","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Anny Slama-Schwok","author_inst":"INSERM  and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Heather Hendrickson","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ghazaleh Eskandari","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Muthiah Kumaraswami","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason S.

As the global pandemic ensues, scientist are working to evaluate the virus and develop a vaccine to counteract the deadly disease that has impacted lives across the entire globe. We perform computational electrostatic simulations on multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein s1 in complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) variants to examine differences in electrostatic interactions across the various complexes. Calculations are performed across the physiological pH range to also examine the impact of pH on these interactions. Two of six spike protein s1 variations having greater electric forces at pH levels consistent with nasal secretions and significant variations in force across all five variants of ACE2. Five out of six spike protein s1 variations have relatively consistent forces at pH levels of the lung, and one spike protein s1 variant that has low potential across a wide range of pH. These predictions indicate that variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and human ACE2 in certain combinations could potentially play a role in increased binding efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Scott P Morton","author_inst":"Middle Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Joshua L Phillips","author_inst":"Middle Tennessee State University"},{"author_name":"Mario-Andres Pizzorno","author_inst":"Lyon I University, CIRI, INSERM 1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Julien Henri","author_inst":"Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique CNRS UMR 8226"},{"author_name":"Francis Berenbaum","author_inst":"Sorbonne University, INSERM, CRSA UMR S_938, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Lyon I University, CIRI, INSERM U 1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Bruno Feve","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne Universitu CRSA UMR S_938, AP-HP, ICAN"},{"author_name":"Frederic Adnet","author_inst":"AP-HP, SAMU, Avicenne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michele Sabbah","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calavatra","author_inst":"University Lyon I, CIRI, INSERM U1111, CNRS UMR 5308, Ens de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Vincent Marechal","author_inst":"INSERM and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Anny Slama-Schwok","author_inst":"INSERM  and Sorbonne University, CRSA UMR S_938"},{"author_name":"Heather Hendrickson","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ghazaleh Eskandari","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Muthiah Kumaraswami","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason S.

We performed an integrative proteo-transcriptomics analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infected HuH7 cells to map the cellular response to the invading virus over time. We identified four pathways, ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling, among others that were markedly modulated during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a significant reduction in activated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 72 hours post infection. Unlike other human respiratory viruses, we found a significant inhibition of HIF-1 through the entire time course of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and the mTOR\/HIF-1 signaling. Further investigations are required to better understand the molecular sequelae in order to guide potential therapy in the management of severe COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sofia Appelberg","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden, Solna, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Soham Gupta","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anoop T Ambikan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Flora Mikaeloff","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Akos Vegvari","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Sara Svensson Akusjarvi","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Rui Benfeitas","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Maike Sperk","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Marie Stahlberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Shuba Krishnan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Kamal Singh","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Josef M Penninger","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Ali Mirazimi","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ujjwal Neogi","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Muthiah Kumaraswami","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason S.
