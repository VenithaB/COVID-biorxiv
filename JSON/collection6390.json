We performed a systematic literature search in three stages: First, we reviewed PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL for systematic reviews of SARS-CoC-2 and COVID-19 in pediatric populations, and reviewed their primary articles; next, we searched PubMed for studies on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 and asthma\/wheeze, and evaluated whether the resulting studies included pediatric populations; lastly, we repeated the second search in BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org to find pre-prints that may have information on pediatric asthma. In the first search, eight systematic reviews were found, of which five were done in pediatric population; after reviewing 67 primary studies we found no data on pediatric asthma as a comorbidity for COVID-19. In the second search, we found 25 results in PubMed, of which five reported asthma in adults, but none included data on children. In the third search, 14 pre-prints in MedRxiv were identified with data on asthma, but again none with pediatric data. We found only one report by the U.S. CDC stating that 40\/345 (~11.5%) children with data on chronic conditions had \"chronic lung diseases including asthma\". There is scarcely any data on whether childhood asthma (or other pediatric respiratory diseases) constitute risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity. Studies are needed that go beyond counting the number of cases in the pediatric age range.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose A Castro-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Erick Forno","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090944","rel_title":"Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090944","rel_abs":"Importance: Preliminary reports indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 patients and is associated with worse outcomes. AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States is not well-described. Objective: To provide information about frequency, outcomes and recovery associated with AKI and dialysis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Observational, retrospective study. Setting: Admitted to hospital between February 27 and April 15, 2020. Participants: Patients aged [&ge;]18 years with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 Exposures: AKI (peak serum creatinine increase of 0.3 mg\/dL or 50% above baseline). Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with mortality. We also trained and tested a machine learning model for predicting dialysis requirement with independent validation. Results: A total of 3,235 hospitalized patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. AKI occurred in 1406 (46%) patients overall and 280 (20%) with AKI required renal replacement therapy. The incidence of AKI (admission plus new cases) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit was 68% (553 of 815). In the entire cohort, the proportion with stages 1, 2, and 3 AKI were 35%, 20%, 45%, respectively. In those needing intensive care, the respective proportions were 20%, 17%, 63%, and 34% received acute renal replacement therapy. Independent predictors of severe AKI were chronic kidney disease, systolic blood pressure, and potassium at baseline. In-hospital mortality in patients with AKI was 41% overall and 52% in intensive care. The aOR for mortality associated with AKI was 9.6 (95% CI 7.4-12.3) overall and 20.9 (95% CI 11.7-37.3) in patients receiving intensive care. 56% of patients with AKI who were discharged alive recovered kidney function back to baseline. The area under the curve (AUC) for the machine learned predictive model using baseline features for dialysis requirement was 0.79 in a validation test. Conclusions and Relevance: AKI is common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, associated with worse mortality, and the majority of patients that survive do not recover kidney function. A machine-learned model using admission features had good performance for dialysis prediction and could be used for resource allocation.","rel_num_authors":63,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lili

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in COVID-19 patients are scarce due to difficulties to obtain such examination in infected unstable patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: To investigate the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities in non-survivors of COVID-19 in a virtopsy framework. Design: Prospective, case series study with postmortem brain MRI obtained early (<24h) after death. Setting: Monocentric study. Participants: From 31\/03\/2020 to 24\/04\/2020, consecutive decedents who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were included: death <24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 detection on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, chest computerized tomographic (CT) scan suggestive of COVID-19, absence of known focal brain lesion, and MRI compatibility. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Signs of acute brain injury and MRI signal abnormalities along the olfactory tract and brainstem were searched independently by 3 neuroradiologists, then reviewed with neurologists and clinicians. Results: Among the 62 patients who died from COVID-19 during the inclusion period, 19 decedents fulfilled inclusion criteria. Subcortical micro- and macro-bleeds (2 decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, one decedent), and nonspecific deep white matter changes (one decedent) were observed. Asymmetric olfactory bulbs were found in 4 other decedents without downstream olfactory tract abnormalities. No brainstem MRI signal abnormality. Conclusions and Relevance: Postmortem brain MRI demonstrates hemorrhagic and PRES-related brain lesions in non-survivors of COVID-19 that might be triggered by the virus-induced endothelial disturbances. SARS-CoV-2-related olfactory impairment seems to be limited to olfactory bulbs. The absence of brainstem MRI abnormalities does not support a brain-related contribution to respiratory distress in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tim

Using a dynamic panel representation of an epidemiological model of disease spread, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for US counties from daily reported number of cases over a 20-day period of rapid disease growth. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high median income have a high incidence of cases but reported lower deaths. Income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, is found to be associated with more deaths and more cases. The remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports is evidence of the spread of the virus by way of international travel. The distributions of age, race, and health risk factors such as obesity and diabetes are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with better access to health care as measured by the number of primary care physicians per capita have lower deaths, and so do places with more health awareness as measured by flu vaccination prevalence. Environmental health conditions such as the amount of air pollution is found to be associated with counties with higher deaths from the virus. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nivedita Mukherji","author_inst":"Oakland University"},{"author_name":"Valentina Lolli","author_inst":"CUB Hopital Erasme, Universite libre

This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time. METHODS: We study the perception of COVID-19 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet on platforms: Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry, from January 2020 to 29.04.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.20). We present trend analysis with a support of natural language processing techniques. RESULTS: We identified seven temporal major clusters of interest on the topic COVID-19: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Social distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield, 7) Restrictions releasing. There was an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease around 11\/12.03.20 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there was a decay in interest with additional phases related to social distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act with local peaks. We have found that declarations of mitigation strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest to such extent. Traditional news agencies were ahead of social media (mainly Twitter) in dissemination of information. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial searching term antiviral mask in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia SARS-CoV-2 as well official incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual risk of acquiring infection. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrzej Jarynowski","author_inst":"Institute for

From 3\/10\/2020-5\/1\/2020 NewYork-Presbyterian laboratories performed 27,377 SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays from 22,338 patients. Repeat testing was performed in 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had negative and 1,019 had positive first day results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to be older, male, African-American or Hispanic, and to have severe disease. Among the patients with initially negative results, 18.6% became positive upon repeat-testing. Only 58.1% of any-time positive patients had a result of \"detected\" on the first test. The clinical sensitivity of COVID-19 molecular assays is estimated between 66.2% and 95.6%, depending on the unknown number of false negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to a negative result is unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20-30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Forty-nine initially-positive patients converted to negative and then back to positive in subsequent days. Conversion from first day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same or next 2 days after a negative test in a patient with high suspicion for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel A.

However, the global genetic diversity and transmissions are still unclear. Methods: 3050 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were retrieved from GIASID database. After aligned by MAFFT, the mutation patterns were identified by phylogenetic tree analysis. Results: We detected 17 high frequency (>6%) mutations in the 3050 sequences. Based on these mutations, we classed the SARS-CoV-2 into four main groups and 10 subgroups. We found that group A was mainly presented in Asia, group B was primarily detected in North America, group C was prevailingly appeared in Asia and Oceania and group D was principally emerged in Europe and Africa. Additionally, the distribution of these groups was different in age, but was similar in gender. Group A, group B1 and group C2 were declined over time, inversely, group B2, group C3 and group D were rising. At last, we found two apparent expansion stages (late Jan-2020 and late Feb-2020 to early Mar-2020, respectively). Notably, most of groups are quickly expanding, especially group D. Conclusions: We classed the SARS-CoV-2 into four main groups and 10 subgroups based on different mutation patterns at first time. The distribution of the 10 subgroups was different in geography, time and age, but not in gender. Most of groups are rapidly expanding, especially group D. Therefore, we should attach importance to these genetic diversity patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and take more targeted measures to constrain its spread.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhi-wei Chen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Zhao Li","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Institute of Surgery Research, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Hu Li","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Hong Ren","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"author_name":"Tanya Lawson","author_inst":"Division of Medical Microbiology and Virology, St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"R.

To characterize the host responses and identify potential biomarkers during disease progression, we performed a longitudinal transcriptome analysis for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from 4 COVID-19 patients at 4 different time points from symptom onset to recovery. We found that PBMCs at different COVID-19 disease stages exhibited unique transcriptome characteristics. SARS-CoV-2 infection dysregulated innate immunity especially type I interferon response as well as the disturbed release of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators, and an aberrant increase of low-density neutrophils may cause tissue damage. Activation of cell death, exhaustion and migratory pathways may lead to the reduction of lymphocytes and dysfunction of adaptive immunity. COVID-19 induced hypoxia may exacerbate disorders in blood coagulation. Based on our analysis, we proposed a set of potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and predicting the risk of severity.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qihong

Testing and tracing coverage need to exceed 50% in order to see substantial gains; if both are below 50%, contact tracing cannot reduce transmission by more than 10%. With 90% testing and tracing as well as high isolation and quarantine efficacy, contact tracing could reduce overall transmission by >45%, which would allow for partial loosening of physical distancing measures. Benefits of contact tracing could be enhanced by testing all contacts rather than only those with symptoms and by policies to support high adherence to voluntary isolation and quarantine.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alyssa Bilinski","author_inst":"Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farzad

Alternative approaches based on combinations of isothermal amplification and CRISPR-mediated detection, such as the SHERLOCK ( S pecific H igh S ensitivity E nzymatic R eporter Un LOCK ing) technique, offer reduced dependence on RT-qPCR equipment, but previously reported methods required multiple fluid handling steps, complicating their deployment outside clinical labs. Here we developed a simple test chemistry called STOP (SHERLOCK Testing in One Pot) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in one hour that is suitable for point-of-care use. This simplified test, STOPCovid, provides sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests and has a limit of detection of 100 copies of viral genome input in saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs per reaction. Using lateral flow readout, the test returns result in 70 minutes, and using fluorescence readout, the test returns result in 40 minutes. Moreover, we validated STOPCovid using nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients and were able to correctly diagnose 12 positive and 5 negative patients out of 3 replicates. We envision that implementation of STOPCovid will significantly aid \"test-trace-isolate\" efforts, especially in low-resource settings, which will be critical for long-term public health safety and effective reopening of the society.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Joung","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Department of Biological Engineering at MIT"},{"author_name":"Alim Ladha","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Department of Biological Engineering at MIT"},{"author_name":"Makoto Saito","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Departments of Biological Engineering and Bra"},{"author_name":"Michael Segel","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT; Departments of Biological Engineering and Bra"},{"author_name":"Robert Bruneau","author_inst":"University of Washington, Seattle"},{"author_name":"Meei-li W Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington, Seattle"},{"author_name":"Nam-Gyun Kim","author_inst":"University of Washington, Seattle"},{"author_name":"Xu Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard; Massachusetts General Hospital; Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard; Brigham and Women's Hospital; Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness"},{"author_name":"Bruce D.

There is no specific treatment or vaccine identified and the focus has been preventive measures based on statistical and mathematical models. These have relied on analyzing the behavior of populations and characteristics of the infection and applying modelling techniques. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections across affected countries could give useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture dynamics of disease spread and growth. Data for this study used the number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 in three selected countries, Sri Lanka, Italy and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 20th April 2020. In this study Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential growth curves were fitted on cumulative number of infections across countries. Akaikes information criteria (AIC) was used in determining the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy and China-Hebei are Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic curves respectively. The overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated. Log incidences over time in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreaks of countries. Hence, doubling time\/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions were estimated. Findings altogether demonstrate that outbreak seems extinct in Hebei-China whereas further transmissions are possible in Sri Lanka. In Italy, current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate.

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, were mostly restricted to data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change+\/-100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7+\/- 28.7, mean+\/- SD), taste (-69.0+\/- 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3+\/- 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","rel_num_authors":122,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valentina Parma","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, Temple University"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Ohla","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Research Center J\u00fclich"},{"author_name":"Maria G.

Human milk IgG originates mainly from blood, therefore a SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody (Ab) response in milk would be expected (1). However, IgG comprises only ~2% of milk Ab, with most milk Abs originating from mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (1). Therefore, the extent of the milk immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown (2). This response is critical for infants and young children, who tend not to suffer greatly from COVID-19 pathology but are likely responsible for significant virus transmission (3-5). Perhaps even more significant is the fact that milk Abs could be purified and used as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given they would likely be of the secretory (s) class and highly resistant to proteolytic degradation in the respiratory tissue (2, 6). In this preliminary report, 15 milk samples obtained from donors previously-infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as 10 negative control samples obtained prior to December 2019 were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by ELISAs measuring IgA, IgG, IgM, and secretory Ab. Eighty percent of samples obtained post-COVID-19 exhibited IgA reactivity, and all these samples were also positive for secretory Ab reactivity, suggesting the IgA is predominantly sIgA. COVID-19 group mean OD values of undiluted milk were significantly greater for IgA (p<0.0001), secretory-type Abs (p<0.0001), and IgG (p=0.017), but not for IgM, compared to pre-pandemic group mean values. Overall, these data indicate that there is strong sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk after infection in the majority of individuals, and that a comprehensive study of this response is highly warranted.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alisa Fox","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jessica Marino","author_inst":"University of California Merced"},{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hahn-Holbrook","author_inst":"University of California Merced"},{"author_name":"Susan Zolla-Pazner","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rebecca L Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Bouysset","author_inst":"Institut de Chimie de Nice, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pirastu","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michele Dibattista","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, Universita' degli Studi di Bari A.

Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission od epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. To overcome this limitation, we formulated the real-time forecasting and evaluating multiple public health intervention problem into forecasting treatment response problem and developed recurrent neural network (RNN) for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics and Counterfactual-RNN (CRNN) for evaluating and exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide. We applied the developed methods to the real data collected from January 22, 2020 to May 8, 2020 for real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiyang Ge","author_inst":"Fu Dan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Shudi Li","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Momiao Xiong","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rebecca L Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Bouysset","author_inst":"Institut de Chimie de Nice, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pirastu","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michele Dibattista","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, Universita' degli Studi di Bari A.

Within approximately 30 days, the total number of confirmed cases climbed up to 1,000, accompanied by a doubling period of less than 3 days. About one week later, after this number exceeded 4,000 cases, and following some extreme lockdown measures taken by the Israeli government, the daily infection rate started a sharp decrease from the peak value of 1,131 down to slightly more than 100 new confirmed cases on April 30. Motivated by this encouraging data, similar to the trends observed in many other countries, along with the growing economic pressures, the Israeli government has quickly lifted most of its emergency regulations. Throughout May, the daily number of new cases stayed at a very low level of 20-40 until at the end of May it started a steady increase, exceeding 1,000 by the end of June and 2,000 on July 22. As suggested by some experts and popular media, this disturbing trend may be even a part of a \"second wave\". This article attempts to analyze the currently available data on Israel, compared to three European countries (Greece, Italy, and Sweden), in order to understand the local dynamics of COVID-19, assess the effect of the implemented intervention measures, and discuss some plausible scenarios for the foreseeable future.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Last","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Shudi Li","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Momiao Xiong","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rebecca L Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Bouysset","author_inst":"Institut de Chimie de Nice, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pirastu","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michele Dibattista","author_inst":"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sensory Organs, Universita' degli Studi di Bari A.

We present an insight into the spread of Covid19 in Nigeria in order to establish a suitable prediction model, which can be applied as a decisionsupportive tool for assigning health interventions and mitigating the spread of the Covid19 infection. Methodology: Daily spread data from February 27 to April 26, 2020, were collected to construct the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model using the R software. Stability analysis and stationarity test, parameter test, and model diagnostic were also carried out. Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA model was evaluated using the AICc model selection criteria. Results: The ARIMA (1,1,0) model was finally selected among ARIMA models based upon the parameter test and Box Ljung test. A ten day forecast was also made from the model, which shows a steep upward trend of the spread of the COVID19 in Nigeria within the selected time frame. Conclusion: Federal Government of Nigeria through the presidential task force can apply the forecasted trend of much more spread to make more informed decisions on the additional measures in place to curb the spread of the virus. Application of the model can also assist in studying the effectiveness of the lockdown on the on the spread of Covid19 in Nigeria.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rauf Rauf Ibrahim","author_inst":"Department of mathematics, University of Abuja, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"OLUWAKEMI HANNAH OLADIPO","author_inst":"Bioresource Development Centre (BIODE\/NABDA), Ilorin"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

As such, the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making. Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time. In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemic's dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerrit Grossmann","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Michael Backenkoehler","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Verena Wolf","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

Planners, governments, and agencies are scrambling to figure out \"How much? How bad?\" and how to effectively treat the potentially large numbers of simultaneously sick people. Modeling the CoVID-19 pandemic using an exponential rise implicitly assumes a nearly unlimited population of uninfected persons (\"dilute pandemic\"). Once a significant fraction of the population is infected (\"saturated pandemic\"), an exponential growth no longer applies. A new model is developed here, which modifies the standard exponential growth function to account for factors such as Social Distancing. A Social Mitigation Parameter [SMP] \/s\\ is introduced to account for these types of society-wide changes, which can modify the standard exponential growth function, as follows: N(t)= No exp[ +Ko t\/(1 + \/s\\ t)] . The doubling-time t\/dbl\\=(ln2)\/Ko can also be used to substitute for Ko, giving a {t\/dbl\\, \/s\\} parameter pair for comparing to actual CoVID-19 data. This model shows how the number of CoVID-19 infections can self-limit before reaching a saturated pandemic level. It also provides estimates for: (a) the timing of the pandemic peak, (b) the maximum number of new daily cases that would be expected, and (c) the expected total number of CoVID-19 cases. This model shows fairly good agreement with the presently available CoVID-19 pandemic data for several individual States, and the for the USA as a whole (6 Figures), as well as for various countries around the World (9 Figures). An augmented model with two Mitigation Parameters, \/s\\ and {beta}\/s\\, is also developed, which can give better agreement with the daily new CoVID-19 data. Data-to-model comparisons also indicate that using \/s\\ by itself likely provides a worst-case estimate, while using both \/s\\ and {beta}\/s\\ likely provides a best-case estimate for the CoVID-19 spread.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genghmun Eng","author_inst":"Retired Scientist"},{"author_name":"Michael Backenkoehler","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Verena Wolf","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

The epidemic has been mitigated by social distancing and the lockdown introduced on 17 and 23 March 2020 respectively. We recently reported a stochastic model of a mitigated epidemic which incorporated changes in social interactions and daily movements and whose simulations were consistent with the initial PHE daily mortality data. However, on 29 April, PHE revised their historic data to include out-of-hospital deaths in England. Out-of-hospital deaths occur sooner than in-hospital deaths. Here we show that if 20% of deaths, representing out-of-hospital deaths, are assigned a shorter illness period, then simulated daily mortality matches the revised PHE mortality at least until 4 May. We now predict that if the lockdown is gently relaxed in late May, whilst maintaining social distancing, there would be a modest second-wave which may be acceptable when weighed against the risks of maintaining the lockdown. Our model complements other more sophisticated work currently guiding national policy but which is not presently in the public domain.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony D Lander","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Thejasvi Subramanian","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham UK"},{"author_name":"Verena Wolf","author_inst":"Saarland University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengcen Qian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

For most of these nations, the total number of infected individuals exhibits a succession of exponential growth and power-law growth before the flattening of the curve. In particular, we find a universal {surd}t growth before they reach saturation. However, at present, India, which has I(t) ~ t2, and Russia and Brazil, which have I(t) [~] t, are yet to flatten their curves. Thus, the polynomials of the I(t) curves provide valuable information on the stage of the epidemic evolution, thus on the life cycle of COVID-19 pandemic. Besides these detailed analyses, we compare the predictions of an extended SEIR model and a delay differential equation-based model with the reported infection data and observed good agreement among them, including the {surd}t behaviour. We argue that the power laws in the epidemic curves may be due to lockdowns.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumyadeep Chatterjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India"},{"author_name":"Ali Asad","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India"},{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Shashwat Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India"},{"author_name":"Shadab Alam","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India"},{"author_name":"Mahendra K.

METHODS: Government websites from countries with minimum 1000 cases in adults and children on April 13, 2020 were searched to find the number of cases confirmed in children, the age range, and the number leading to hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. A systematic literature search was performed April 13, 2020 to find additional data from cases series. RESULTS: Data on pediatric cases were available from government websites for 23 of the 70 countries with minimum 1000 cases by April 13, 2020. Of 424 978 cases in these 23 countries, 8113 (1.9%) occurred in children. Nine publications provided data from 4251 cases in 4 additional countries. Combining data from the websites and the publications, 330 of 2361 cases required admission (14%). The ICU admission rate was 2.2 % of confirmed cases (44 of 2031) and 7.2% of admitted children (23 of 318). Death was reported for 15 cases. CONCLUSION: Children accounted for 1.9% of confirmed cases. The true incidence of pediatric infection and disease will only be known once testing is expanded to individuals with less severe or no symptoms. Admission rates vary from 0.3 to 10% of confirmed cases (presumably varying with the threshold for testing) with about 7% of admitted children requiring ICU care. Death is rare in middle and high income countries.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle Barton Forbes","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Kayur Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Kriti Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jielin Lu","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Nicole Le Saux","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Margaret Sampson","author_inst":"Library Services, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Joan Robinson","author_inst":"Stollery Childrens Hospital, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socio-economic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces close contacts of those infected with COVID- 19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing among the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app take-up, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. Methods We conducted a multi-country, large-scale (N = 5995) study to measure public support for digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs. automatic installation by mobile phone providers), and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. Results: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all sub-groups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We inves- tigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate take-up and found that concerns about cyber security and privacy, together with lack of trust in government, are the main barriers to adoption. Conclusions: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact-tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if take-up is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Altmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luke Milsom","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hannah Zillessen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Blasone","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Frederic Gerdon","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Ruben Bach","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Frauke Kreuter","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Daniele Nosenzo","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Severine Toussaert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

Aims: The purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence of liver injury and the differences between liver injury markers among different patients with COVID-19 in China. Methods: Computer searches of PubMed, Embase, CNKI and medRxiv were used to obtain reports on the incidence and markers of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, from January 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020. (No. CRD42020181350) Results: A total of 57 reports from China were included, including 9889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the patients with early COVID-19 infection in China, the incidence of liver injury events was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-26.4%). Liver injury in severe patients was more common than that in non-severe patients, with a risk ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.43). Quantitative analysis showed that the severe the coronavirus infection, the higher the level of AST, ALT, TB, ALP, GGT and the lower the level of ALB. The changing trend of the appeal index was similar in ICU patients and dead patients. Conclusion: There is a certain risk of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, and the risk and degree of liver injury are related to the severity of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Zhao","author_inst":"1.

Potential therapies and means of prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulfate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulfate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. We performed a retrospective observational study to compare hospital outcomes among patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. Methods: Data was collected from electronic medical records for all patients being treated with admission dates ranging from March 2, 2020 through April 5, 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. Patients in the study were excluded if they were treated with other investigational medications. Results: The addition of zinc sulfate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation, or ICU duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulfate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU, and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulfate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.09) reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice remained significant (OR 0.449, 95% CI 0.271-0.744). Conclusion: This study provides the first in vivo evidence that zinc sulfate in combination with hydroxychloroquine may play a role in therapeutic management for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip Carlucci","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tania Ahuja","author_inst":"New York University Langone Health, Department of Pharmacy, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Petrilli","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Harish Rajagopalan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Division of Healthcare Delivery Science, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Joseph Rahimian","author_inst":"NYU Langone"},{"author_name":"Frauke Kreuter","author_inst":"University of Mannheim"},{"author_name":"Daniele Nosenzo","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Severine Toussaert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rishemjit Kaur","author_inst":"V1-B, CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation"},{"author_name":"Marco Tullio Liuzza","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, \"Magna Graecia\" University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Marta Y.

There are however some countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient salinity. METHOD: PM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity. RESULTS: One month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4 - 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6 - 79.8) (p<0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically significant. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 - 617mgCl\/m2\/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19 rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl\/m2\/TAG) (p<0.003). CONCLUSION: High levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.

Monitoring and documenting government strategies during the COVID-19 crisis is crucial to understand the progression of the epidemic. Following a content analysis strategy of existing public information sources, we developed a specific hierarchical coding scheme for NPIs. We generated a comprehensive structured dataset of government interventions and their respective timelines of implementation. To improve transparency and motivate collaborative validation process, information sources are shared via an open library. We also provide codes that enable users to visualise the dataset. Standardization and structure of the dataset facilitate inter-country comparison and the assessment of the impacts of different NPI categories on the epidemic parameters, population health indicators, the economy, and human rights, among others. This dataset provides an in-depth insight of the government strategies and can be a valuable tool for developing relevant preparedness plans for pandemic. We intend to further develop and update this dataset on a weekly basis until the end of December 2020.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amelie Desvars-Larrive","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna"},{"author_name":"Elma Dervic","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Nils Haug","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Thomas Niederkrotenthaler","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Jiaying Chen","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Anna Di Natale","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Jana Lasser","author_inst":"Complexity SCience Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Diana S Gliga","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Roux","author_inst":"Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales"},{"author_name":"Abhijit Chakraborty","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Alexandr Ten","author_inst":"National Research Institute for Digital Sciences (INRIA)"},{"author_name":"Alija Dervic","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pacheco","author_inst":"German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig"},{"author_name":"David Cserjan","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Diana Lederhilger","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Dorontine Berishaj","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Erwin Flores Tames","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Huda Takriti","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Jan Korbel","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Jenny Reddish","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Johannes Stangl","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Lamija Hadziavdic","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Laura Stoeger","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Leana Gooriah","author_inst":"German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Lukas Geyrhofer","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Marcia R Ferreira","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Rainer Vierlinger","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samantha Holder","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alvarez","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"Simon Haberfellner","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Verena Ahne","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Viktoria Reisch","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Vito DP Servedio","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Xiao Chen","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Xochilt Maria Pocasangre-Orellana","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"David Garcia","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Stefan Thurner","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Liang-Dar Hwang","author_inst":"The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Hakan Ozdener","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Dolors Gu\u00e0rdia","author_inst":"Food Technology, IRTA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Laudamiel","author_inst":"DreamAir Llc"},{"author_name":"Marina Ritchie","author_inst":"Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jan Havl\u00edcek","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Charles University"},{"author_name":"Denis Pierron","author_inst":"M\u00e9decine Evolutive UMR5288, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse-CNRS"},{"author_name":"Eugeni Roura","author_inst":"Centre for Nutrition and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marta Navarro","author_inst":"Centre for Nutrition and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alissa A.

There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, leaving governments and public health agencies with little defense against the virus aside from advising or enforcing best practices for virus transmission prevention, which include hand-washing, physical distancing, use of face covers, and use of effective disinfectants. In this study, a novel iodine complex called CupriDyne(R) was assessed for its ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. CupriDyne was shown to be effective in inactivating the virus in a time-dependent manner, reducing virus titers by 99% (2 logs) after 30 minutes, and reducing virus titers to below the detection limit after 60 minutes. The novel iodine complex tested herein offers a safe and gentle alternative to conventional disinfectants for use on indoor and outdoor surfaces.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily K Mantlo","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alex Evans","author_inst":"BioLargo, Inc."},{"author_name":"Laura Patterson-Fortin","author_inst":"BioLargo Water, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jenny Boutros","author_inst":"BioLargo Water, Inc."},{"author_name":"Richard Smith","author_inst":"BioLargo Water, Inc."},{"author_name":"Slobodan Paessler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jana Lasser","author_inst":"Complexity SCience Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Diana S Gliga","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Roux","author_inst":"Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales"},{"author_name":"Abhijit Chakraborty","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Alexandr Ten","author_inst":"National Research Institute for Digital Sciences (INRIA)"},{"author_name":"Alija Dervic","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pacheco","author_inst":"German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig"},{"author_name":"David Cserjan","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Diana Lederhilger","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Dorontine Berishaj","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Erwin Flores Tames","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Huda Takriti","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Jan Korbel","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Jenny Reddish","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Johannes Stangl","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Lamija Hadziavdic","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Laura Stoeger","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Leana Gooriah","author_inst":"German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Lukas Geyrhofer","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Marcia R Ferreira","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Rainer Vierlinger","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samantha Holder","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alvarez","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"Simon Haberfellner","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Verena Ahne","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Viktoria Reisch","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Vito DP Servedio","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Xiao Chen","author_inst":"Independent scholar"},{"author_name":"Xochilt Maria Pocasangre-Orellana","author_inst":"Fundacion Naturaleza El Salvador"},{"author_name":"David Garcia","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Stefan Thurner","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Liang-Dar Hwang","author_inst":"The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Hakan Ozdener","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Dolors Gu\u00e0rdia","author_inst":"Food Technology, IRTA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Laudamiel","author_inst":"DreamAir Llc"},{"author_name":"Marina Ritchie","author_inst":"Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jan Havl\u00edcek","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Charles University"},{"author_name":"Denis Pierron","author_inst":"M\u00e9decine Evolutive UMR5288, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse-CNRS"},{"author_name":"Eugeni Roura","author_inst":"Centre for Nutrition and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marta Navarro","author_inst":"Centre for Nutrition and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alissa A.
