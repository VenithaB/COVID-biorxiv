Pediatric surgery is not an exception. Prioritization protocols allowing us to provide emergency surgical care to the children in need while controlling the pandemic spread. The aim of this study is to share our experiences with the outcome of children with COVID 19 who had a co existing surgical emergency. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency department and later diagnosed to have COVID 19 by RT PCR. The study duration was 3 months (April 2020 to June 2020). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken from all patients irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR with the purpose of detecting asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms. Emergency surgical services were provided immediately without delay and patients with positive test results were isolated according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients into 4 age groups for the convenience of data analysis. Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using SPSS (version 25) software. Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board. Results: Total patients were 32. Seven (21.9%) of them were neonates. Twenty four (75%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception. Only two patients had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%) patients. Fourteen (43.8%) patients required surgical treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.5 days. One neonate with ARM died in the postoperative ward due to cardiac arrest. No patient had hypoxemia or organ failure. Seven health care workers (5.51%) including doctors & nurses got infected with SARS Co V2 during this period. Conclusion: Our study has revealed a milder course of COVID 19 in children with minimal infectivity even when present in association with emergency surgical conditions. This might encourage a gradual restart to mitigate the impact of COVID 19 on children surgery.

As a result, post-lockdown COVID-19 dynamics are heterogenous and difficult to interpret. Here we describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changsha) during the pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-lockdown period to quantify the transmission impact of relaxing interventions via changes in age-specific contact patterns. We estimate that the mean number of contacts increased 5%-17% since the end of the lockdown but are still 3-7 times lower than their pre-pandemic levels. We find that post-lockdown contact patterns in China are still sufficiently low to keep SARS-CoV-2 transmission under control. We also find that the impact of school interventions depends non-linearly on the share of other activities being resumed. When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77% decrease in the reproductive number; in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5% reduction in transmission. Moving forward, to control COVID-19 spread without resorting to a lockdown, it will be key to dose relaxation in social mixing in the community and strengthen targeted interventions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Huilin Shi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.01.20166546","rel_title":"Analytical and clinical performances of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in comparison with neutralization activity","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.01.20166546","rel_abs":"Background. Reliable high-throughput serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) are urgently needed for the effective containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is of crucial importance to understand the strength and duration of immunity after infection, and to make informed decisions concerning the activation or discontinuation of physical distancing restrictions. Methods. In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Findings. Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.8%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT50 correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (rho = 0.541, p < 0.001). Interpretation. The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection. Further studies should be conducted to achieve a stronger correlation between antibody measurement and PRNT50 in order to obtain useful information for providing effective passive antibody therapy, and developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"university of padova"},{"author_name":"Laura Sciacovelli","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedale Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesco Bonfante","author_inst":"Istituto Zooprofilattico Veneto"},{"author_name":"Matteo Pagliari","author_inst":"Zooprofilattico Veneto"},{"author_name":"Dania Bozzato","author_inst":"Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cosma","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedale Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Alessio Bortolami","author_inst":"Zooprofilattico Veneto"},{"author_name":"Davide Negrini","author_inst":"Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Zuin","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.01.20166595","rel_title":"Implication of backward contact tracing in the presence of overdispersed transmission in COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.01.20166595","rel_abs":"Unlike forward contact tracing, backward contact tracing identifies the source of newly detected cases.

Real-time RT - PCR (Reverse transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) is used to amplify the viral RNA and enable its detection. Although PCR is 37 years old, it is still considered, without dispute, as the gold standard. PCR is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in DNA amplification, microfluidics and membrane technologies, we succeeded to create a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT - LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or highly fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using pools of naso-pharyngal clinical samples, we estimated a sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR (up to a Cycle threshold of 39, equivalent to <0.1 TCID50 per mL) and a 100% specificity, for other human coronaviruses and eight respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called COVIDISC to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment paves the way towards a large dissemination of this device. The perspective of a reliable SARS-CoV-2 point of care detection, highly performing, that would deliver on-site results in less than one hour opens up a new efficient approach to manage the pandemics.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pierre Garneret","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Etienne Coz","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Elian Martin","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Jean-Claude Manuguerra","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Elodie Brient-Litzler","author_inst":"Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Enouf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Daniel Felipe Gonzalez Obando","author_inst":"Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin","author_inst":"Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Monti","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.01.20166330","rel_title":"Respiratory viral infections by Non-influenza viruses are associated with more adverse clinical outcome in patients with underlying liver disease: a single centre laboratory based study.","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.01.20166330","rel_abs":"Background Respiratory viral infections are an important cause of acute respiratory tract infections. They are caused by both Influenza and non influenza viruses. Respiratory viral infections are known to be associated with severe clinical outcome especially in the critically ill.

Methods In this retrospective study, clinical records of all adult liver disease patients with clinically confirmed ARI, whose request for respiratory viral testing were received in the virology laboratory during September 2016 - March 2019 were reviewed. Respiratory viruses were identified by real time PCR on FilmArray 2.0 instrument (BioFire Diagnostics, Utah, USA) using Respiratory panel as per the manufacturer's instructions. Results Of the 603 patients of liver disease with clinically confirmed influenza like illness, over all incidence of respiratory viral infection was 24.3% (n= 147). Infections by non-influenza viruses (87, 59.1%) were more than influenza group of viruses. Mortality was higher in non influenza group (43, 49.4%) as compared to influenza (24, 40%) [p=0.015] being maximum in Rhinovirus, 22 (32.8%).

On 30 January, WHO declared the new disease as a PHEIC, then as a Pandemic on 11 March. By mid-March, the virus spread widely; Djibouti was not spared and was hit by the pandemic with the first case detected on 17 March. Djibouti worked with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case, which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic. Methods: COVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020. Results: A total of 1,401 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were included in the study with 4 related deaths (CFR: 0.3%) and an attack rate of 0.15%. Males represented (68.4%) of the cases, with the age group 31-45 years old (34.2%) as the most affected. Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced, which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95-98% asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%). Conclusion: Djibouti responded to COVID-19 pandemic following an efficient and effective strategy, using a strong collaboration between civilian and military health assets that increased the response capacities of the country.

To date, it has spread to more than 200 countries, and has been declared as a global pandemic. For appropriate preparedness, containment, and mitigation response, the stakeholders and policymakers require prior guidance on the propagation of SARS-CoV2. This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead for 173 countries, using four data-driven methodologies; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing model (ETS), random walk forecasts (RWF) with and without drift. We also evaluate the accuracy of these forecasts using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results show that the ARIMA and ETS methods outperform the other two forecasting methods. Additionally, using these forecasts, we generated heat maps to provide a pictorial representation of the countries at risk of having an increase in cases in the coming 4 weeks for June. Due to limited data availability during the ongoing pandemic, less data-hungry forecasting models like ARIMA and ETS can help in anticipating the future burden of SARS-CoV2 on healthcare systems.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ghufran Ahmad","author_inst":"National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Furqan Ahmed","author_inst":"Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, Bremen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Suhail Rizwan","author_inst":"National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Javed Muhammad","author_inst":"University of Swabi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hira Fatima","author_inst":"University of Adelaide, Australia"},{"author_name":"Aamer Ikram","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hajo Zeeb","author_inst":"Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, Bremen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rakhi Maiwall","author_inst":"ILBS"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20167197","rel_title":"Spreading of COVID-19 in Italy as the spreading of a wave packet","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167197","rel_abs":"We [fi]nd that the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy can be described as the propagation of a wave packet in a dispersive medium where the e[ff]ect of Lockdown is simulated by the dispersion relation of the medium.

Restart and recovery processes will be influenced by the need to protect patients and staff from disease transmission, but data on the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy are sparse. This is of particular importance in later pandemic phases when the risk of harm from delayed or missed significant diagnoses is likely to far outweigh the risk of infection. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidance for restarting endoscopy included stratification of diagnostic procedures according to aerosol generation or assessment of infectious risk as well as pragmatic guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We sought to document the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy in this 'COVID-minimised' environment. Prospective data were collected from 18 UK centres for n=6208 procedures, with follow-up telephone assessment of patients at 7 and 14 days. No cases of COVID-19 were documented by any centre after endoscopy in either patients or staff, with 3\/2611 (0.11%) asymptomatic patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab testing pre-endoscopy. While these data cannot determine the relative contribution of each component of a COVID-minimised pathway, they provide clear support for such an approach, are reassuring and should aid planning for outpatient diagnostics in the COVID-19 recovery phase.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bu'Hussain Hayee","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"- The SCOTS project group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"James E East","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research"},{"author_name":"Colin R Rees","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Penman","author_inst":"Centre for Liver & Digestive Disorders, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Aamer Ikram","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hajo Zeeb","author_inst":"Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, Bremen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rakhi Maiwall","author_inst":"ILBS"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.02.20166793","rel_title":"Comparing the impact on COVID-19 mortality of self-imposed behavior change and of government regulations across 13 countries","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.02.20166793","rel_abs":"Background: Countries have adopted different approaches, at different times, to reduce the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cross-country comparison could indicate the relative efficacy of these approaches. We assess various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) over time, comparing the effects of self-imposed (i.e. voluntary) behavior change and of changes enforced via official regulations, by statistically examining their impacts on subsequent death rates in 13 European countries. Methods and findings: We examine two types of NPI: the introduction of government-enforced closure policies over time; and self-imposed alteration of individual behaviors in response to awareness of the epidemic, in the period prior to regulations. Our proxy for the latter is Google mobility data, which captures voluntary behavior change when disease salience is sufficiently high. The primary outcome variable is the rate of change in COVID-19 fatalities per day, 16-20 days after interventions take place. Linear multivariate regression analysis is used to evaluate impacts. Voluntarily reduced mobility, occurring prior to government policies, decreases the percent change in deaths per day by 9.2 percentage points (95% CI 4.5-14.0 pp). Government closure policies decrease the percent change in deaths per day by 14.0 percentage points (95% CI 10.8-17.2 pp). Disaggregating government policies, the most beneficial are intercity travel restrictions, cancelling public events, and closing non-essential workplaces. Other sub-components, such as closing schools and imposing stay-at-home rules, show smaller and statistically insignificant impacts. Conclusions: This study shows that NPIs have substantially reduced fatalities arising from COVID-19. Importantly, the effect of voluntary behavior change is of the same order of magnitude as government-mandated regulations. These findings, including the substantial variation across dimensions of closure, have implications for the phased withdrawal of government policies as the epidemic recedes, and for the possible reimposition of regulations if a second wave occurs, especially given the substantial economic and human welfare consequences of maintaining lockdowns.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian Jamison","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Donald Bundy","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dean Jamison","author_inst":"University of California at San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jacob Spitz","author_inst":"independent researcher"},{"author_name":"Stephane Verguet","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Aamer Ikram","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Hajo Zeeb","author_inst":"Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, Bremen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rakhi Maiwall","author_inst":"ILBS"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20167361","rel_title":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a scoping review of the literature","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167361","rel_abs":"Background: With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new severe life-threatening inflammatory syndrome has been reported in some pediatric populations. Global attention was shifted towards the syndrome termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), with new case reports flooding in. Objectives: The aim of this scoping review is to summarize the existing reports on MIS-C and focus on the demographics, diagnosis, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, treatment, and patient outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systemic search using LitCovid and MEDLINE electronic databases. We screened citations, titles and abstracts, then reviewed potentially relevant articles in full. After data extraction, we reported our final data under subheadings of demographics, diagnosis, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, treatment, and patient outcomes. Results: Our search strategy yielded 42 original studies reporting 674 pediatric patients fitting the case definition of MIS-C. The studies included 21 case reports, 16 case series and 5 cohort studies. The most common reported symptom of MIS-C was fever (98%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were common (N=557, 83%). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured in 125 patients and was elevated in 94 % (N=117). Echocardiography detected coronary artery lesions in 100 patients. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic heparin was required in 34% (N=227) of patients. The most commonly administered treatment modality targeting MIS-C was intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (N=490). Corticosteroids (N=347) and aspirin (N=112) were also integral parts of the treatment regimens. Biologic therapy was integrated into the treatment regimen for 116 patients. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was alarming (N=478, 71%). 9 fatalities were recorded due to MIS-C Conclusions: We believe MIS-C bears pathophysiological resemblance to the well-known Kawasaki disease but with some key differences highlighted. Understanding those differences will aid our management plan for such patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohmed Ali Sabbour","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"},{"author_name":"Seif Tarek El-Swaify","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Nourhan Farrag","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Menna Kamel","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Sara H Ali","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Abdelrahman Amir","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Mazen A Refaat","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Menatalla A Dyab","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Nabhan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt and Egyptian Center for Evidence Based Medicine, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.20166272","rel_title":"Sooner than you think: a very early affective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine in Argentina","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20166272","rel_abs":"The unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic pose serious challenges to mood stability and emotional regulation at all ages. Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33 % and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive andanxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms was the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed. This study is in line with previous literature that highlights the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potentially negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed. We end by discussing implications for public policy based on considering the most vulnerable groups.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernando Torrente","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroscience and Public Policy, INECO Foundation"},{"author_name":"Adrian Ezequiel Yoris","author_inst":"Institute of Cognitive and Translational Neurosciences (INECO Foundation-Favaloro University-CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Daniel Low","author_inst":"Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology, Harvard Medical School & MIT"},{"author_name":"Pablo Lopez","author_inst":"Institute of Cognitive and Translational Neurosciences (INECO Foundation-Favaloro University-CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Pedro Bekinschtein","author_inst":"Institute of Cognitive and Translational Neurosciences (INECO Foundation-Favaloro University-CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Cetkovich","author_inst":"Institute of Cognitive and Translational Neurosciences (INECO Foundation-Favaloro University-CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Facundo Manes","author_inst":"Institute of Cognitive and Translational Neurosciences (INECO Foundation-Favaloro University-CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Menatalla A Dyab","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Nabhan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt and Egyptian Center for Evidence Based Medicine, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.01.20162115","rel_title":"A Study on Survival Scenario of COVID-19 patients in India: An Application of Survival Analysis on patient demographics","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.01.20162115","rel_abs":"The study of transmission dynamics of COVID-19, have depicted the rate, patterns and predictions of the pandemic cases. In order to combat the disease transmission in India, the Government had declared lockdown on the 25th of March.

A positive point to be noted amongst all that the recovered cases are slowly exceeding the active cases. The survival of the patients, taking death as the event that varies over age groups and gender wise is noteworthy. This study aims in carrying out a survival analysis to establish the variability in survivorship among age groups and sex, at different levels, that is, national, state and district level. The open database of COVID-19 tracker (covid19india.org) of India has been utilized to fulfill the objectives of the study. The study period has been taken from the beginning of the first case which was on 30th Jan 2020 till 30th June. Due to the amount of under-reporting of data and dropping missing columns a total of 26,815 sample patients were considered. The entry point of each patient is different and event of interest is death in the study. Kaplan Meier survival estimation, Cox proportional hazard model and multilevel survival model has been used to perform survival analysis. Kaplan Meier survival function, shows that the probability of survival has been declining during the study period of five months. A significant variability has been observed in the age groups, as evident from all the survival estimates, with increasing age the risk of dying from COVID-19 increases. When Western and Central India show ever decreasing survival rate in the framed time period then Eastern , North Eastern and Southern India shows a slightly better picture in terms of survival. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan and West bengal showed alrmingly poor survival as well.

Experience of food insecurity was collected according to the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Factors associated with moderate or severe food insecurity were investigated using the logistic regression model. Setting: Sao Paulo city, Brazil. Participants: 909 householders. Results: 88% of the households included young women working as cleaners or kitchen assistants and in sales services. One-fifth of the participants were recieving federal cash transfer programme, called Bolsa Familia. There were 92% households with children. The most frequent experience reported was uncertainty about food acquisition or receiving more (89%), to eat less than one should (64%), not being able to eat healthy and nutritious food (46%), and skipping a meal (39%). 47% of the participants experienced moderate or severe food insecurity. Factors associated with moderate and severe food insecurity were low income, being Bolsa Familia recipient, a low level of education, and households without children. Conclusions: Half of the participants experienced moderate or severe food insecurity, and close to ten per cent was hungry. Our data suggest that families with children were at lower risk of moderate to severe food insecurity. It is possible that nationally established social programs like Bolsa Familia were protecting those families.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catarina Vezetiv Manfrinato Jr.","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Department of Preventive Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aluizio Marino","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do ABC"},{"author_name":"Vitoria Ferreira Conde","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Enfermagem"},{"author_name":"Maria do Carmo Pinho Franco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina; Escola de Estudos Avancados, Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Elke Stedefeldt","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina"},{"author_name":"Luciana Yuki Tomita","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina"},{"author_name":"Facundo Manes","author_inst":"Institute of Cognitive and Translational Neurosciences (INECO Foundation-Favaloro University-CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Menatalla A Dyab","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Nabhan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt and Egyptian Center for Evidence Based Medicine, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20166983","rel_title":"Application of Social Vulnerability Index to Identify High- risk Population of Contracting COVID-19 Infection: a state-level study.","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20166983","rel_abs":"Social factors that determine the health of a population are known as the social determinants of health.

Although tests to detect anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies have been developed, their sensitivity and specificity in hemodialysis patients have not been previously assessed. Methods: As part of a quality improvement (QI) initiative, nasopharyngeal swabs and predialysis blood samples were collected on the same day from adult patients receiving routine hemodialysis care at clinics managed by a large dialysis organization in the greater Miami, Florida region (23 - 30 Apr 2020). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS -CoV -2 and chemiluminescence immunoassays for anti -SARS -CoV2 antibodies were performed according to manufacturer-specified protocols. Results: Of 715 participants in the QI initiative, 38 had symptomatology consistent with COVID -19 prior to or during the initiative. Among these, COVID -19 was PCR -confirmed in 14 and ruled out in 20, with the remaining 4 being inconclusive. Among the 34 patients with known COVID -19 status, the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test were 57.1% and 85.0% when either antibody was considered. The remaining 677 patients had no record of symptoms consistent with COVID -19, nor any known exposure. Of these, 38 patients (5.6%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Conclusions: The operational characteristics of the laboratory-based antibody test make it sufficient to rule in, but not rule out, SARS -CoV -2 infection in the appropriate clinical circumstance. A substantial proportion of dialysis patients may have had asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dena E Cohen","author_inst":"DaVita Clinical Research"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Marlowe","author_inst":"DaVita Clinical Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Contreras","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Marie Ann Sosa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Jair Munoz Mendoza","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Oliver Lenz","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Zain Mithani","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Pura Margarita Teixeiro","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Nery Queija","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Araceli Moneda","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Jean S Jeanty","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Katherine Swanzy","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Misha Palecek","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Krishnan","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeffery Giullian","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven M Brunelli","author_inst":"DaVita Clinical Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.02.20166751","rel_title":"Gender disparities in international COVID-19 clinical trial leadership","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.02.20166751","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic offers considerable possibilities for research and leadership that might equalize opportunity in a new field; however, our study finds instead that more than two-thirds of investigators leading COVID-19-related clinical studies are predicted to be men.

The active participation of women, trans and gender-nonconforming individuals are needed in research to drive scientific discovery and innovation as well as to better address health disparities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muge Cevik","author_inst":"Infection and Global Health Research, University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Syed Arefinul Haque","author_inst":"Network Science Institute, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Manne","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States"},{"author_name":"Krutika Kuppalli","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States"},{"author_name":"Paul E Sax","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States"},{"author_name":"Maimuna S Majumder","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Chloe Orkin","author_inst":"Blizzard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Pura Margarita Teixeiro","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Nery Queija","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Araceli Moneda","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Jean S Jeanty","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Katherine Swanzy","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Misha Palecek","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Krishnan","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeffery Giullian","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven M Brunelli","author_inst":"DaVita Clinical Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.02.20166785","rel_title":"The Lebanese Cohort for COVID-19; A Challenge for the ABO Blood Group System","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.02.20166785","rel_abs":"A sudden outbreak of pneumonia caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread all over the world facilitating the declaration of the resultant disease as a pandemic in March,2020. In Lebanon, the fast action of announcing a state of emergency with strict measures was among the factors that helped in achieving a successful containment of the disease in the country. Predisposing factors for acquiring COVID-19 and for developing a severe form of this disease were postulated to be related to epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as the genomics signature of a given population or its environment. Biological markers such as the ABO blood group system was amongst those factors that were proposed to be linked to the variability in the disease course and\/or the prevalence of this infection among different groups. We therefore conducted the first retrospective case-control study in the Middle-East and North Africa that tackles the association between the blood group types and the susceptibility as well as the severity of SARS-CoV2 infection. Opposing to the current acknowledged hypothesis, our results have challenged the association significance of this system with COVID-19. Herein, we highlighted the importance of studying larger cohorts using more rigorous approaches to diminish the potential confounding effect of some underlying comorbidities and genetic variants that are known to be associated with the ABO blood group system.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Athar Khalil","author_inst":"American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Hassoun","author_inst":"Rafik Hariri University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rita Feghali","author_inst":"Rafik Hariri University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krutika Kuppalli","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States"},{"author_name":"Paul E Sax","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States"},{"author_name":"Maimuna S Majumder","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Chloe Orkin","author_inst":"Blizzard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Pura Margarita Teixeiro","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Nery Queija","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Araceli Moneda","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Jean S Jeanty","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Katherine Swanzy","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Misha Palecek","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Krishnan","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeffery Giullian","author_inst":"DaVita Inc, Denver, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven M Brunelli","author_inst":"DaVita Clinical Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20167007","rel_title":"Severity Assessment and Progression Prediction of COVID-19 Patients based on the LesionEncoder Framework and Chest CT","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167007","rel_abs":"Automatic severity assessment and progression prediction can facilitate admission, triage, and referral of COVID-19 patients. This study aims to explore the potential use of lung lesion features in the management of COVID-19, based on the assumption that lesion features may carry important diagnostic and prognostic information for quantifying infection severity and forecasting disease progression. A novel LesionEncoder framework is proposed to detect lesions in chest CT scans and to encode lesion features for automatic severity assessment and progression prediction. The LesionEncoder framework consists of a U-Net module for detecting lesions and extracting features from individual CT slices, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) module for learning the relationship between feature vectors and collectively classifying the sequence of feature vectors. Chest CT scans of two cohorts of COVID-19 patients from two hospitals in China were used for training and testing the proposed framework. When applied to assessing severity, this framework outperformed baseline methods achieving a sensitivity of 0.818, specificity of 0.952, accuracy of 0.940, and AUC of 0.903. It also outperformed the other tested methods in disease progression prediction with a sensitivity of 0.667, specificity of 0.838, accuracy of 0.829, and AUC of 0.736. The LesionEncoder framework demonstrates a strong potential for clinical application in current COVID-19 management, particularly in automatic severity assessment of COVID-19 patients. This framework also has a potential for other lesion-focused medical image analyses.

This study characterized a large national cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S., compared to patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia and influenza. Methods and Findings: We captured cross-sectional information from 36 large healthcare systems in 29 U.S. states, participating in PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. Patients included were those diagnosed with COVID-19, viral pneumonia and influenza in any care setting, starting from January 1, 2020. Using distributed queries executed at each participating institution, we acquired information for patients on care setting (any, ambulatory, inpatient or emergency department, mechanical ventilator), age, sex, race, state, comorbidities (assessed with diagnostic codes), and medications used for treatment of COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; corticosteroids, anti-interleukin-6 agents). During this time period, 24,516 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with 42% in an emergency department or inpatient hospital setting; 79,639 were diagnosed with viral pneumonia (53% inpatient\/ED) and 163,984 with influenza (41% inpatient\/ED). Among COVID-19 patients, 68% were 20 to <65 years of age, with more of the hospitalized\/ED patients in older age ranges (23% 65+ years vs. 12% for COVID-19 patients in the ambulatory setting). Patients with viral pneumonia were of a similar age, and patients with influenza were much younger. Comorbidities were common, especially for patients with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia, with hypertension (32% for COVID-19 and 46% for viral pneumonia), arrhythmias (20% and 35%), and pulmonary disease (19% and 40%) the most common. Hydroxychloroquine was used in treatment for 33% and tocilizumab for 11% of COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilators (25% received azithromycin as well). Conclusion and Relevance: PCORnet leverages existing data to capture information on one of the largest U.S. cohorts to date of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia and influenza.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason P Block","author_inst":"Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Keith A.

Epidemiologic data on pediatric COVID-19 cases after school opening is warranted. Methods We analyzed data of the pediatric patients with COVID-19 collected from the press release of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Information on the school opening delay and re-opening policies were achieved from the press release from Korean Ministry of Education. Findings The school openings were delayed three times in March 2020. Online classes started from April 9, and off-line classes started from May 20 to June 8 at four steps in different grades of students. There was no sudden increase in pediatric cases after the school opening, and the proportion of pediatric cases remained around 7.0% to 7.1%. As of July 11, 45 children from 40 schools and kindergartens were diagnosed with COVID-19 after off-line classes started. More than 11,000 students and staff were tested; only one additional student was found to be infected in the same classroom. Among those 45, 32 (71.1%) patients had available information for the source of infection. Twenty-five (25\/45, 55.6%) were infected by the family members. The proportions of pediatric patients without information on infection sources were higher in older age group (middle and high school students) than in younger age group (kindergarten and elementary school students) (47.6% vs 12.5%, p=0.010). In the younger age group, 79.1% of children were infected by family members, while only 28.6% of adolescents in the older age group were infected by family members (p<0.001). Interpretation Korea had a successful transition from school closure to re-opening with online and off-line classes. Although partial, off-line school opening did not cause significant school-related outbreak among pediatric population although young children and adolescents may have different epidemiologic features.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoonsun Yoon","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kyung-Ran Kim","author_inst":"Department of pediatrics, Samsung medical center"},{"author_name":"Hwanhee Park","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Samsung medical center"},{"author_name":"So young Kim","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Konkuk University"},{"author_name":"Yae-Jean Kim","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anders H.

Rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies vary in performance. A critical need exists to perform head-to-head comparison of these assays. Methods. Performance of fifteen different lateral flow POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was performed on a well characterized set of 100 samples. Of these, 40 samples from known SARS-CoV-2-infected, convalescent individuals (average of 45 days post symptom onset) were used to assess sensitivity. Sixty samples from the pre-pandemic era (negative control), that were known to have been infected with other respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses A, B, C and\/or coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63 OC43) were used to assess specificity. The timing of seroconversion was assessed on five POCTs on a panel of 272 longitudinal samples from 47 patients of known time since symptom onset. Results. For the assays that were evaluated, the sensitivity and specificity for any reactive band ranged from 55%-97% and 78%-100%, respectively. When assessing the performance of the IgM and the IgG bands alone, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0%-88% and 80%-100% for IgM and 25%-95% and 90%-100% for IgG. Longitudinal testing revealed that median time post symptom onset to a positive result was 7 days (IQR 5.4, 9.8) for IgM and 8.2 days (IQR 6.3 to 11.3). Conclusion. The testing performance varied widely among POCTs with most variation related to the sensitivity of the assays. The IgM band was most likely to misclassify pre-pandemic samples. The appearance of IgM and IgG bands occurred almost simultaneously.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven E Conklin","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Martin","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Yukari C Manabe","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haley A Schmidt","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Morgan Keruly","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Ethan Klock","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Charles S Kirby","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Owen R Baker","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Reinaldo E Fernandez","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Yolanda J Eby","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Justin Hardick","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Shaw-Saliba","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Richard E Rothman","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Patrizio P Caturegli","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Andrew R Redd","author_inst":"NIAID & JHU"},{"author_name":"Aaron AR Tobian","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Evan M Bloch","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"H Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Quinn","author_inst":"NIAID & JHU"},{"author_name":"William Clarke","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"NIAID & JHMI"},{"author_name":"Dermot P.B.

Detection and SIR simulations","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167098","rel_abs":"Background. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from stabilizing. Of particular concern is the sharp increase in the number of diseases in June-July 2020. The causes and consequences of this sharp increase in the number of cases are still waiting for their researchers, but there is already an urgent need to assess the possible duration of the pandemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. The resumption of international passenger traffic needs the information for deciding which countries' citizens are welcome guests. Correct simulation of the infectious disease dynamics needs complicated mathematical models and many efforts for unknown parameters identification. Constant changes in the pandemic conditions (in particular, the peculiarities of quarantine and its violation, situations with testing and isolation of patients) cause various epidemic waves, lead to changes in the parameter values of the mathematical models. Objective. In this article, pandemic waves in Ukraine and in the world will be detected, calculated and discussed. The estimations for hidden periods, epidemic durations and final numbers of cases will be presented. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers will be calculated for different countries and regions. Methods. We propose a simple method for the epidemic waves detection based on the differentiation of the smoothed number of cases. We use the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model for the dynamics of the epidemic waves. The known exact solution of the SIR differential equations and statistical approach were modified and used. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified for four waves of pandemic dynamics in Ukraine and five waves in the world. The number of cases and the number of patients spreading the infection versus time were calculated. In particular, the pandemic probably began in August 2019. If current trends continue, the end of the pandemic should be expected no earlier than in March 2021 both in Ukraine and in the world, the global number of cases will exceed 20 million. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers were calculated for different countries and regions. Conclusions. The SIR model and statistical approach to the parameter identification are helpful to make some reliable estimations of the epidemic waves. The number of persons spreading the infection versus time was calculated during all the epidemic waves. The obtained information will be useful to regulate the quarantine activities, to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic and to decide which countries' citizens are welcome guests.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igor Nesteruk","author_inst":"Institute of Hydromechanics National Academy of sciences of Ukraine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Martin","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Yukari C Manabe","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haley A Schmidt","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Morgan Keruly","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Ethan Klock","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Charles S Kirby","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Owen R Baker","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Reinaldo E Fernandez","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Yolanda J Eby","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Justin Hardick","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Shaw-Saliba","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Richard E Rothman","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Patrizio P Caturegli","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Andrew R Redd","author_inst":"NIAID & JHU"},{"author_name":"Aaron AR Tobian","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Evan M Bloch","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"H Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Quinn","author_inst":"NIAID & JHU"},{"author_name":"William Clarke","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"NIAID & JHMI"},{"author_name":"Dermot P.B.
