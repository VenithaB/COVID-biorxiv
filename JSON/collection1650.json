Objective: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. Setting: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. Methods: Regression was used to find relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. Results: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2=0.610, p= 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature on SARS-CoV2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase leads to a 1% decrease--and a one degree decrease leads to a 3.7% increase--in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, with the reverse true in winter months. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam Ian Kaplin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caesar Junker","author_inst":"Joint Artificial Intelligence Center"},{"author_name":"Anupama Kumar","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Anne de Amorim Ribeiro","author_inst":"PUPA"},{"author_name":"Eileen Yu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ted Smith","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shesh Nath Rai","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aruni Bhatnager","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176842","rel_title":"Healthcare workers high COVID-19 infection rate: the source of infections and potential for respirators and surgical masks to reduce occupational infections","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176842","rel_abs":"Objective: To analyse the work-related exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and trace the source of COVID-19 infections in tertiary hospitals healthcare workers in light of the used PPE and their ability to maintain social distances and follow governmental restrictions. Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: Tertiary hospitals in Uusimaa region, Finland Participants: Of 1072 enrolled, 866 HCWs (588 nurses, 170 doctors and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) from the Helsinki University Hospital completed the questionnaire by July 15th, 2020. The average age of participants was 42.4 years and 772 (89.0%) were women. The participants answered a detailed questionnaire of their PPE usage, ability to follow safety restrictions, exposure to COVID-19, the source of potential COVID-19 infection and both mental and physical symptoms during the first wave of COVID-19 in Finland. Main outcome measures: All participants with COVID-19 symptoms were tested with either RT-PCR or antibody tests. The infections were traced and categorised based on the location and source of infection. The possibility to maintain social distance and PPE usage during exposure were analyzed. Results: Of the HCWs that participated, 41 (4.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, marking a substantially higher infection rate than that of the general population (0.3%); 22 (53.6%) of infections were confirmed or likely occupational, including 7 (31.8%) from colleagues. Additionally, 5 (26.3%) of other infections were from colleagues outside the working facilities. 14 (63.6%) of occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2\/3 respirator and aerosol precautions while treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: While treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, HCWs should wear an FFP2\/3 respirator and recommended PPE. Maintaining safety distances in the workplace and controlling infections between HCWs should be priorities to ensure safe working conditions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lotta-Maria A.

Social risk factors, together with other demographic and community characteristics, may reveal local variations and inequities in COVID risk that could be useful for targeting testing and interventions. Yet to date, rates of infection and estimations of COVID risk are typically reported at the county and state level. In this study we develop a small area vulnerability index based on publicly-available sociodemographic data and 668,428 COVID diagnoses reported in 4,803 ZIP codes in the United States (15% of all ZIP codes). The outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis rates per 100,000 people by ZIP code. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic characteristics obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Bayesian multivariable techniques were used to capture complexities of spatial data and spatial autocorrelation and identify individual risk factors and derive their respective weights in the index. COVID-19 diagnosis rates varied from zero to 29,508 per 100,000 people. The final vulnerability index showed that higher population density, higher percentage of noninsured, nonwhite race and Hispanic ethnicity were positively associated with COVID-19 diagnosis rates. Our findings indicate disproportionate risk of COVID-19 infection among some populations and validate and expand understanding of these inequities, integrating several risk factors into a summary index reflecting composite vulnerability to infection. This index can provide local public health and other agencies with evidence-based metrics of COVID risk at a geographical scale that has not been previously available to most US communities.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ofer amram","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Solmaz Amiri","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Emily L Thorn","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Jacob J.

In April 2020, multiple reports of an association between a hyperinflammatory, Kawasaki-like condition and SARS-CoV-2 were published and termed as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS). A thorough characterization of this syndrome (demographics, presentation, diagnosis, and outcome) is currently lacking. Objective. We aimed to perform a systematic review of published cases of this novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19. Evidence review. A literature search of Pubmed, Embase, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and COVID-19 specific research repositories (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database) was conducted from December 30th, 2019 to June 30th, 2020. Publications describing inflammatory syndromes associated with COVID-19 were included. Of 333 unique publications, 229 records were excluded based on title and abstract. After screening the full text, 40 observational studies and case reports were included, comprising 687 cases (published between May 9th, 2020 and June 30th, 2020). Findings. In contrast to classic Kawasaki disease, epidemiological enrichment for adolescents (median age 9 [6.0-12.3]) and ethnic minorities (35.8% black and 24.5% Hispanic\/Latino) was observed. There was a male predominance (59.1%). Apart from obesity (24.4%), pre-existing conditions were infrequent. The majority suffered from gastrointestinal (87.2%) and cardiocirculatory (79.2%) manifestations. Respiratory symptoms (51.2%) were less frequent. Over half of patients (56.3%) presented with hemodynamic shock, and critical care interventions were often necessary (inotropics (56.5%), mechanical ventilation (22.9%), non-invasive ventilation (30.6%), extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO;4.5%)). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and RT-PCR were positive in respectively 69.4% and 36.7%. Eleven deaths were reported (1.6%). The RCPCH case definition proved to be most comprehensive comprising all single cases. In contrast, WHO and CDC MIS definitions are more stringent, with the CDC case definition often missing severe cases requiring intensive care (n = 33 out of 95 cases). Conclusions and Relevance. This novel pediatric multisystem hyperinflammatory condition, associated with COVID-19, is characterized by a severe and heterogeneous disease spectrum. Despite frequent intensive care interventions, mortality rate was low and short-term outcome favorable. Long-term follow-up of possible chronic complications and additional clinical research, to elucidate the underlying immunological pathogenesis and possible genetic predisposition is crucial.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Levi Hoste","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruben Van Paemel","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Filomeen Haerynck","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacob J.

However, as some studies have shown, virions can remain infectious for up to 72 hours on surfaces, which can lead to transmission through contact. For this reason, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that the effective combination of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces include using an Isohelix swab as a collection tool, DNA\/RNA Shield as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as the detection assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some cases, SARS-CoV-2 viral standards were still recovered from surfaces as detected by RT-qPCR for as long as eight days even after bleach treatment. Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment surfaces appeared to negatively impact the recovery of RNA, with Amerstat inhibition as high as 90% when challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2 to successfully detect virus from test surfaces. When this method was employed to evaluate 368 samples collected from various built environmental surfaces, all samples tested negative, indicating that the surfaces were either void of virus or below the detection limit of the assay.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ceth W.

Though most European countries have overcome the first epidemic wave, it remains of high priority to quantify the efficiency of different NPIs to inform preparedness for an impending second wave. In this study, combining capture-recapture methods with Bayesian inference in an age-structured mathematical model, we use a unique European dataset compiled by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to quantify the efficiency of 24 NPIs and their combinations (referred to as public health responses, PHR) in reducing SARS-Cov-2 transmission rates in 32 European countries. Of 166 unique PHR tested, we found that median decrease in viral transmission was 74%, which is enough to suppress the epidemic. PHR efficiency was positively associated with the number of NPIs implemented. We found that bans on mass gatherings had the largest effect among NPIs, followed by school closures, teleworking, and stay home orders. Partial implementation of most NPIs resulted in lower than average response efficiency. This first large-scale estimation of NPI and PHR efficiency against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe suggests that a combination of NPIs targeting different population groups should be favored to control future epidemic waves.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andres Garchitorena","author_inst":"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement"},{"author_name":"Hugo Gruson","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Bernard Cazelles","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Benjamin ROCHE","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Jason M Wood","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Arman Seuylemezian","author_inst":"California Polytechnic University of Pomona"},{"author_name":"Parag Vaishampayan","author_inst":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Camilla Urbaniak","author_inst":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ryan Hendrickson","author_inst":"Jet Propulsion Lab"},{"author_name":"Pheobe Laaguiby","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Kevin Clark","author_inst":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory-NASA"},{"author_name":"Brian G Clement","author_inst":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Niamh B O'Hara","author_inst":"Biotia"},{"author_name":"Mara Couto-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Biotia"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bezdan","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chris Mason","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Kasthuri Venkateswaran","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176552","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children with MIS-C and mild and severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176552","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children remain poorly characterized.

As the mask covers the eyes, mouth and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost and helps addressing the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles below 500 nm.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Schmitt","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Lewis S.

Here we present results from a large serosurveillance study of 10,019 asymptomatic HCW conducted during April-May 2020, in eight hospital medical centers across the state of Oregon, USA during the initial peak of the pandemic. Free and voluntary testing was performed at 14 +\/- 3 day intervals, over a 4-week window at each site, utilizing a lab-developed ELISA based on the Epitope Diagnostics COVID-19 nucleocapsid IgG detection Kit. We identified 253 SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive individuals among 10,019 total participants, representing a cross-sectional seroprevalence of 2.53%. Subgroup analysis identified differential seropositivity by job role, ranging from 8.03% among housekeepers, odds ratio 3.17 (95% CI 1.59-5.71), to 0.00% among anesthesiologists, odds ratio 0.00 (95% CI 0-0.26), both of which were significant. Over the course of the study, 17 seroconversions (0.25%) and 101 seroreversions (1.50%) were identified. Self-reported SARS-CoV-2 swab qPCR testing, when compared with subsequent serology on study, showed only modest agreement, {kappa} = 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62). Overall, these findings demonstrate relatively low seroprevalence and very low seroconversion rates among HCW in Oregon, USA, over a period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high rate of seroreversion observed in this cohort, and the relatively high discordance between SARS-CoV-2 serology and swab qPCR, highlight limitations of current detection methods, and stress the need for development of novel assessment methodologies to more accurately identify exposure (and\/or immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 in this population.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rom Leidner","author_inst":"Earle A.

To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles - AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a Real Time-PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of RT-PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bartolomeo Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Michele Cennamo","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Antonio Minopoli","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Raffaele Campanile","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Sergio Bolletti Censi","author_inst":"Cosvitec scarl"},{"author_name":"Daniela Terracciano","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Portella","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Raffaele Velotta","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Alec Saitman","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

An abnormal LUS is associated with increased risk for ICU admission in COVID-19. Previously described LUS manifestations for COVID-19 include B-lines, consolidations, and pleural thickening. The interrater reliability (IRR) of these findings for COVID-19 is unknown. Research Question: What is the interrater reliability of lung ultrasound findings in patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19? Study Design and Methods: This study was conducted at conducted at two academic medical centers between 03\/2020-06\/2020. Nine physicians (hospitalists: n=4; emergency medicine: n=5) independently evaluated n=20 LUS scans (n=180 independent observations) collected from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. These studies were randomly selected from an image database consisting of COVID-19 patients evaluated in the emergency department with portable ultrasound devices. Physicians were blinded to any patient information or previous LUS interpretation. Kappa values were used to calculate IRR. Results: There was substantial IRR on the following items: normal LUS scan (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), presence of B-lines (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), >=3 B-lines observed (K=0.72 [95% CI: 0.64-0.79]). Moderate IRR was observed for the presence of any consolidation (K=0.57 [95% CI: 0.50-0.64]), subpleural consolidation (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.42-0.56]), and presence of effusion (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.41-0.56]). Fair IRR was observed for pleural thickening (K=0.23 [95% CI: 0.15-0.30]). Interpretation: Many LUS manifestations for COVID-19 appear to have moderate to substantial IRR across providers from multiple specialties utilizing differing portable devices. The most reliable LUS findings with COVID-19 may include the presence\/count of B-lines or determining if a scan is normal. Clinical protocols for LUS with COVID-19 may require additional observers for the confirmation of less reliable findings such as consolidations.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre Kumar","author_inst":"Stanford Unviersity"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Weng","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sally Graglia","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sukyung Chung","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Youyou Duanmu","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Farhan Lalani","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kavita Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Viveta Lobo","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Trevor Jensen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John Kugler","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Leidner","author_inst":"Scientific Literacy Association"},{"author_name":"Kendall Sawa","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Marsal","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Kevin Olson","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Nancy Frisco","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Amy Compton-Phillips","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Walter Urba","author_inst":"Earle A.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggers distinct patterns of pneumonia progression with multiorgan disease, calling for cell- and\/or tissue-type specific host injury markers. METHODS. An integrated hypothesis-free single biomarker analysis framework was performed on nasal swabs (n=484) from patients with COVID-19 in GSE152075. The origin of candidate biomarker was assessed in single-cell RNA data (GSE145926). The candidate biomarker was validated in a cross-sectional cohort (n=564) at both nucletide and protein levels. RESULTS. Phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7) was identified as a candidate biomarker in COVID-19. PLA2G7 was predominantly expressed by proinflammatory macrophages in lungs emerging with progression of COVID-19. In the validation stage, PLA2G7 was found in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, rather than patients suffered mild H1N1 influenza infection. The positive rates of PLA2G7 ranging from 29.37% to 100.00% were positively correlated with not only viral loads in patients with COVID-19 but also severity of pneumonia in non COVID-19 patients. Although Ct values of PLA2G7 in severe pneumonia was siginificantly lower than that in moderate pneumonia (P=7.2e-11), no differences were observed in moderate pneumonia with COVID-19 between severe pneumonia without COVID-19 (P=0.81). Serum protein levels of PLA2G7, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), were further found to be elevated and beyond the upper limit of normal in patients with COVID-19, especially among the re-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS. We firstly identified and validated PLA2G7, a biomarker for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), was abnormally enhanced in COVID-19 patients at both nucletide and protein aspects. These findings provided indications into the prevalence of cardiovascular involvements seen in COVID-19 patients. PLA2G7 could be a hallmark of COVID-19 for monitoring disease progress and therapeutic response.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yongzhong JIANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Yi ZHANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Naizhe LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Qiangling YIN","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Linlin LIU","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Xin LV","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Yan LIU","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China"},{"author_name":"Aqian LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Bin FANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Jiajia LI","author_inst":"The Center for Scientific Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230022, China"},{"author_name":"Hengping YE","author_inst":"Xiantao Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiantao 433000, China"},{"author_name":"Gang YANG","author_inst":"Xiangyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiangyang 441000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxian CUI","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai 200336, China"},{"author_name":"Yang LIU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan QU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Chuan LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Jiandong LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Dexin LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.20035691","rel_title":"COVID-19 ICU and mechanical ventilation patient characteristics and outcomes - A systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.20035691","rel_abs":"Background Insight into COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patient characteristics, rates and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and associated outcomes as well as any regional discrepancies is critical in this pandemic for individual case management and overall resource planning. Methods and Findings Electronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19 ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms. Relevant data was subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q tests. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed. Pooled odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out based on patient regions. A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19 ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed. Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95% CI 0.12-0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61-0.75]. ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3% [95% CI 0.25-0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29-0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99-8.63] and 10.12 [95% CI 7.08-13.16] days respectively. Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37-61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66-16.01]. Subgroup analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes. Conclusions This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU and IMV cases and associated outcomes to date and the only analysis to implicate IMV's associtaion with COVID-19 ICU mortality. The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as research into optimal ventilation strategies for patients. Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raymond Chang","author_inst":"Institute of East West Medicine"},{"author_name":"Khaled Mossad Elhusseiny","author_inst":"Al-Azhar University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Chang Yeh","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei-zen Sun","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospial"},{"author_name":"Qiangling YIN","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Linlin LIU","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Xin LV","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Yan LIU","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China"},{"author_name":"Aqian LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Bin FANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Jiajia LI","author_inst":"The Center for Scientific Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230022, China"},{"author_name":"Hengping YE","author_inst":"Xiantao Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiantao 433000, China"},{"author_name":"Gang YANG","author_inst":"Xiangyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiangyang 441000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxian CUI","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai 200336, China"},{"author_name":"Yang LIU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan QU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Chuan LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Jiandong LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Dexin LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.20176073","rel_title":"Impacts on Surgery Resident Education at a first wave COVID-19 epicenter","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.20176073","rel_abs":"Background: This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital. Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Ostapenko","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samantha McPeck","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Shawn Liechty","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kleiner","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiangling YIN","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Linlin LIU","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Xin LV","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Yan LIU","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China"},{"author_name":"Aqian LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Bin FANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Jiajia LI","author_inst":"The Center for Scientific Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230022, China"},{"author_name":"Hengping YE","author_inst":"Xiantao Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiantao 433000, China"},{"author_name":"Gang YANG","author_inst":"Xiangyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiangyang 441000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxian CUI","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai 200336, China"},{"author_name":"Yang LIU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan QU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Chuan LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Jiandong LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Dexin LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"surgery"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.20176057","rel_title":"On the use of growth models for forecasting epidemic outbreaks with application to COVID-19 data","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.20176057","rel_abs":"The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modeled using exponential growth models.

Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection\/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (Susceptible- Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenangnon F.

Although practitioners focused on the pulmonary devastation, resources for the provision of dialysis proved to be more constrained. To deal with these shortfalls, NYC Health and Hospitals\/Bellevue, NYU Brooklyn, NYU Medical Center and the New York Harbor VA Healthcare System, put together a plan to offset the anticipated increased needs for kidney replacement therapy. Prior to the pandemic, peritoneal dialysis was not used for acute kidney injury at Bellevue Hospital. We were able to rapidly establish an acute peritoneal dialysis program at Bellevue Hospital for acute kidney injury patients in the intensive care unit. A dedicated surgery team was assembled to work with the nephrologists for bedside placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheters. A multi-disciplinary team was trained by the lead nephrologist to deliver peritoneal dialysis in the intensive care unit. Between April 8, 2020 and May 8, 2020, 39 peritoneal dialysis catheters were placed at Bellevue Hospital. 38 patients were successfully started on peritoneal dialysis. As of June 10, 2020, 16 patients recovered renal function. One end stage kidney disease patient was converted to peritoneal dialysis and was discharged. One catheter was poorly functioning, and the patient was changed to hemodialysis before recovering renal function. There were no episodes of peritonitis and nine incidents of minor leaking, which resolved. Some patients received successful peritoneal dialysis while being ventilated in the prone position. In summary, despite severe shortages of staff, supplies and dialysis machines during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to rapidly implement a de novo peritoneal dialysis program which enabled provision of adequate kidney replacement therapy to all admitted patients who needed it. Our experience is a model for the use of acute peritoneal dialysis in crisis situations.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina J Caplin","author_inst":"NYU MedicalCenter and School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Olga Zhdanova","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manish Tandon","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Thompson","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dhwanil Patel","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qandeel Somroo","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fny Ranjeeta","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leian Joseph","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Scherer","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shivam Joshi","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Betty Dyal","author_inst":"Lower Manhattan Dialysis Center, New York, NY 10016"},{"author_name":"Harminder Chawla","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sita Lakshmi","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Doug Bails","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Judith Benstein","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David S Goldfarb","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bruce Gelb","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Amerling","author_inst":"St. George's University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David M Charytan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.254375","rel_title":"Equine hyperimmune globulin raised against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has extremely high neutralizing titers","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.254375","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 750,000 deaths and over 20 million confirmed cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 within 8 months since the emergence of the virus. While there are no vaccines approved and considering the difficulty in meeting the large vaccination demand worldwide, the potential use of passive immunization should be considered based on existing successful therapies against many diseases. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Five horses were subcutaneously inoculated for 6 weeks with the recombinant S protein (ectodomain, residues 1-1208). Four out of the 5 horses presented a strong immune response. Considering the average of all 5 horses, ELISA titers above 1:1,000,000 and neutralizing titers (PRNT90) reaching 1:14,604 were observed. When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. To prevent eventual side effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG was digested with pepsin and purified by fractional salt precipitation to eliminate Fc fragments, a process that is industrially used for the production of passive immunization F(ab)2 concentrates against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab)2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients. The great advantage of using the recombinant trimeric S glycoprotein is that it is safe and provides quick adaptive immunity in horses. Our data show the perspective of using hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab)2 preparations as a passive immunization therapy in humans, similar to therapies that have been safely used for decades against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Eduardo R.

Three hundred and nineteen compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were identified and confirmed, including 91 approved drug and 49 investigational drugs. Among these confirmed compounds, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of 230 compounds, including 38 approved drugs, have not been previously reported.

Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/238444v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ff1ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193d84corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d6f9eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b16c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract.

Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.\n\nBIGGER PICTUREAn effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies on integration of many different types of data available about SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.

Whether this affected heart disease deaths is unknown. Objective: To determine whether changes in heart disease deaths occurred during the early pandemic period in the US, we analyzed areas without large COVID-19 outbreaks. This isolated the effect of decreased healthcare-seeking behavior during the early outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: We performed an observational study of heart disease-specific mortality using National Center for Health Statistics data (NCHS). Weekly provisional counts were disaggregated by jurisdiction of occurrence during 2019 and 2020 for all-cause deaths, COVID-19 deaths, and heart disease deaths. For the primary analysis, jurisdictions were included if; 1) There was no all-cause excess mortality during the early pandemic period (weeks 14-17, 2020); 2) The completeness of that data was estimated by NCHS to be >97% as of July 22, 2020, and; 3) Decreases in emergency department (ED) visits occurred during the study period. We compared heart disease death rates during the early pandemic period with corresponding weeks in 2019 and a pre-pandemic control period of 2020 as a sensitivity analysis. Incident rate and rate ratios were calculated. Exposure: The US COVID-19 outbreak. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of heart disease deaths. Results: Twelve states met the primary inclusion criteria, capturing 747,375,188 person-weeks for the early pandemic period and 740,987,984 person-weeks for the 2019 control period. The mean incidence rate (per 100,000 person-weeks) for heart disease in states without excess deaths during the early pandemic period was 3.95 (95% CI 3.83 to 4.06) versus 4.19 (95% CI 4.14 to 4.23) during the corresponding period in 2019. The incident rate ratio (2020\/2019) was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.97). No state recorded an increase from either the corresponding period in 2019 or the 2020 pre-pandemic control period. Two states recorded fewer heart disease deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: This observational study found a decrease in heart disease deaths during the early US outbreak in regions without significant COVID-19 burdens, despite decreases in ED utilization. Long term follow-up data are needed.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy Samuel Faust","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiu Lin","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital, Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation"},{"author_name":"Kalen N.

A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2\/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2.

To that end, we evaluated a novel amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin P.

In the present study, we performed indepth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1,222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor.

However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudoparticle infection of cells artificially overexpressing IFITMs. Here, we confirmed that overexpression of IFITMs blocks pseudoparticle infections mediated by the Spike proteins of {beta}-coronaviruses including pandemic SARS-CoV-2. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFITM expression promoted genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells both in the presence and absence of interferon. IFITM2 was most critical for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced virus production from Calu-3 cells by several orders of magnitude. IFITMs are expressed and further induced by interferons in the lung representing the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in other relevant tissues.

Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anti-coronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V.

We utilize, genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries regional information such as deaths and cases per million as well as covid-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anastasis Oulas","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"Maria Zanti","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"Marios Tomazou","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"Margarita Zachariou","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"George Minadakis","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"Marilena M Bourdakou","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"Pavlos Pavlidis","author_inst":"Foundation for Research and Technology, Hellas"},{"author_name":"George M Spyrou","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhuang","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Nanjing University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.
