In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources"},{"author_name":"Jing-Zhe Jiang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Hua","author_inst":"Guangdong Academy of Forestry"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Wang","author_inst":"Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fanghui Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Feng Wan","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jiejian Zou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center"},{"author_name":"Jingping Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.19.956581","rel_title":"Structure, function and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.19.956581","rel_abs":"The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus associated with an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia (Covid-2019) resulted in infections of more than 72,000 people and claimed over 1,800 lives. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein trimers promote entry into cells and are the main target of the humoral immune response. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1\/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain, and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into target cells, thereby indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra C Walls","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"M.

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-\/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-\/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-\/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceGiven the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Anne Beall","author_inst":"UNC Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Martin T.

We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 [A] in the presence of B0AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 [A], allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the different affinities between ACE2 and the RBDs from these two related viruses.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renhong Yan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Lu Xia","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Yang","author_inst":"Sino Biological Inc."},{"author_name":"Long Chen","author_inst":"Sinocelltech Group Ltd."},{"author_name":"Ji Yang","author_inst":"Sinocelltech Group Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Sinocelltech Group Ltd."},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

To better understand the initial step of infection at atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound with the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 [A] resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the 2019-nCoV RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. Structural analysis identified residues in 2019-nCoV RBD critical for ACE2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD for improved binding to ACE2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD are also analyzed with the 2019-nCoV RBD, providing insights into future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jinfang Yu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Sisi Shan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shilong Fan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xuanling Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.20023655","rel_title":"SEIR Transmission dynamics model of 2019 nCoV coronavirus with considering the weak infectious ability and changes in latency duration","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.20023655","rel_abs":"Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability.

Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively. Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xing Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China; NHC Key Laboratory of Reproduction Regulation (Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research), P"},{"author_name":"Zihui Ma","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yi Ning","author_inst":"Meinian Institute of Health; Peking University Health Science Center Meinian Public Health Research Institute, Beijing"},{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental and Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Bejing, China"},{"author_name":"Rujin Chen","author_inst":"Donor Service, Shanghai Blood Center, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qiwen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Integrative Oncology, Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Heng Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Chunming Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yan He","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng Tong","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Junqing Wu","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Reproduction Regulation (Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research), Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Reproduction Regulation (Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research), Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Handong Ma","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shaodian Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxin Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Synyi Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.20023721","rel_title":"Evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.20023721","rel_abs":"The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak originating from Wuhan, China, poses a threat to global health.

A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haoyang Sun","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Borame Lee Dickens","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Mark Chen","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Alex Richard Cook","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Hannah Eleanor Clapham","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Zhongsi Hong","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Siwen Huang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhenyi Zhang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xianqi Lin","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhaoxiong Fang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Renxu Lai","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shoudeng Chen","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jin Huang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Xia","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.20024166","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics and Progression of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Patients Concurrent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.20024166","rel_abs":"Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. Clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yichun Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Ran Luo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Meng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhixiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Dong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ying Yao","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuwang Ge","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Renxu Lai","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shoudeng Chen","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jin Huang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Xia","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.18.20024570","rel_title":"Modeling and Prediction of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Spreading in China Incorporating Human Migration Data","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.18.20024570","rel_abs":"This study integrates the daily intercity migration data with the classic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model to construct a new model suitable for describing the dynamics of epidemic spreading of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.

Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinghua Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Yijing Wang","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Stuart Gilmour","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Mengying Wang","author_inst":"Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Yoneoka","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi You","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Gu","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun Hao","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Liping Peng","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Du","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Dong Roman Xu","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuantao Hao","author_inst":"Sun Yat Sen University"},{"author_name":"Jin Huang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Xia","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.18.20024448","rel_title":"Psychological responses, behavioral changes and public perceptions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a population based cross-sectional survey","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.18.20024448","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score [&ge;]10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001).

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients ([&ge;]60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800\/L, 300\/L, or 400\/L, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800\/L, 300\/L, and 400\/L, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command,Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Chenhui Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yingjun Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiewan Chen","author_inst":"Medical English Department, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Ning","author_inst":"Hanyang Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of science and technology, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zeqing Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Xia","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.18.20024661","rel_title":"Association of Population Migration and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic Control","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.18.20024661","rel_abs":"Background and Objective To analyze the impact of different patterns of migration flow in two cities, Hefei and Shenzhen, on the epidemic and disease control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies. Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4{+\/-}15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15{+\/-}17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Ding","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 2.Institute of Public Health, U"},{"author_name":"Sihui Luo","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 2.Institute of Public Health, U"},{"author_name":"Xueying Zheng","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 2.Institute of Public Health, U"},{"author_name":"Ping Ling","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China."},{"author_name":"Tong Yue","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China."},{"author_name":"Zhirong Liu","author_inst":"3.Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC, Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 4.Anhui Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hefei Anhui 23"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 2.Institute of Public Health, U"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zeqing Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Xia","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.18.20024414","rel_title":"Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.18.20024414","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents  = 2.1 {+\/-} 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and\/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin F Maier","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Dirk Brockmann","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute & Institute for Theoretical Biology, Humboldt University of Berlin"},{"author_name":"Xueying Zheng","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 2.Institute of Public Health, U"},{"author_name":"Ping Ling","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China."},{"author_name":"Tong Yue","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China."},{"author_name":"Zhirong Liu","author_inst":"3.Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC, Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 4.Anhui Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hefei Anhui 23"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"1.The First Affiliation Hospital of University of Science and Technology (Anhui Provincial Hospital), Hefei Anhui 230001, China. 2.Institute of Public Health, U"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zeqing Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Xia","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liu","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.20023820","rel_title":"Fractal kinetics of COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.20023820","rel_abs":"We give an update to the original paper posted on 2\/17\/20 -- now (as of 3\/1\/20) the China deaths are rapidly decreasing, and we find an exponential decline to the power law similar to the that predicted by the network model of \\citet{vazquez_polynomial_2006}. At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna L.

The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying Diao","author_inst":"Wuhan University; Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Windoor Information Technology Co.

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2\/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million\/L) than moderate cases (11000 million\/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U\/L, 567.2 U\/L, 135.2 mg\/L and 1734.4 ug\/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U\/L, 234.4 U\/L, 51.4 mg\/L and 880.2 ug \/L). IL-2R, TNF- and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg\/mL, 10.9 pg\/mL and 10.9 pg\/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg\/mL, 7.5 pg\/mL and 6.6 pg\/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million\/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million\/L). The expressions of IFN-{gamma} by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-{gamma} production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guang Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Di Wu","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Guo","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Cao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Da Huang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Hongwu Wang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Zhang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Huilong Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Haijing Yu","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Zhang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Minxia Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shiji Wu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Song","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Meifang Han","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.15.20023234","rel_title":"The estimate of infected individuals of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus in South Korea by incoming international students from the countries of risk of 2019-Novel Coronavirus: a simulation study","rel_date":"2020-02-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.15.20023234","rel_abs":"Background: In March 2020, overall, 37,000 international students from the country at risk of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection will arrive in Seoul, South Korea. Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and perform a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine. Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the total number of the infected individuals would reach 24-53 from March 17-March 20, 50-86 from March 18-March 16, and 234-343 from March 4-March 23 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious individuals, in Seoul, South Korea, respectively. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. Conclusion: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine are warranted along with other containment policies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sukhyun Ryu","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon"},{"author_name":"Sheikh Taslim Ali","author_inst":"3WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jun-sik Lim","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Science, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul"},{"author_name":"Byung Chul Chun","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Da Huang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Hongwu Wang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Zhang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Huilong Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Haijing Yu","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Zhang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Minxia Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shiji Wu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Song","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Meifang Han","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.20024018","rel_title":"COVID-19 in a Designated Infectious Diseases HospitalOutside Hubei Province,China","rel_date":"2020-02-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.20024018","rel_abs":"Background A new type of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Previous investigations reported patients in Wuhan city often progressed into severe or critical and had a high mortality rate.The clinical characteristics of affected patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less well understood. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0. Conclusions In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qingxian Cai","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Deliang Huang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Ou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hong Yu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhibin Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhang Xia","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yinan Su","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhenghua Ma","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yiming Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Li","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Chen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tao Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Meifang Han","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.20023614","rel_title":"Utilize State Transition Matrix Model to Predict the Novel Corona Virus Infection Peak and Patient Distribution","rel_date":"2020-02-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.20023614","rel_abs":"Background: Since December 2019, a pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has broken out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2\/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ke Wu Sr.","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junhua Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"CreditWise Technology Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hong Yu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhibin Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhang Xia","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yinan Su","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhenghua Ma","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yiming Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Li","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Chen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tao Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Meifang Han","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
