Dysregulated host immune response in the lung is a key feature in ARDS pathophysiology. However, cellular actors in Covid-19-driven ARDS are poorly understood. Here, we dynamically analyzed the biology of innate T cells, a heterogeneous class (MAIT, {gamma}{delta}T and iNKT cells) of T lymphocytes, presenting potent anti-infective and regulatory functions. Patients presented a compartmentalized lung inflammation paralleled with a limited systemic inflammation. Circulating innate T cells of critically ill Covid-19 patients presented a profound and persistent phenotypic and functional alteration. Highly activated innate T cells were detected in airways of patients suggesting a recruitment to the inflamed site and a potential contribution in the regulation of the local inflammation. Finally, the expression of the CD69 activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells at inclusion was predictive of disease severity. Thus, patients present an altered innate T cell biology that may account for the dysregulated immune response observed in Covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youenn Jouan","author_inst":"CHRU de Tours"},{"author_name":"Antoine Guillon","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Loic Gonzalez","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Yonatan Perez","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Stephan Ehrmann","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Marion Ferreira","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Thomas Daix","author_inst":"CIC Limoges"},{"author_name":"Robin Jeannet","author_inst":"CIC Limoges"},{"author_name":"Bruno Francois","author_inst":"CIC Limoges"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20089136","rel_title":"A Network-Based Stochastic Epidemic Simulator: Controlling COVID-19 with Region-Specific Policies","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20089136","rel_abs":"In this work, we present an open-source stochastic epidemic simulator, calibrated with extant epidemic experience of COVID-19.

As other European Union member states, Portugal is now preparing the phased loosening of the confinement measures, starting in the beginning of May. Even so, the current data, albeit showing at least a reduction in infection rates, renders difficult to forecast scenarios in the imminent future. Using South Korea data as scaffold, which is becoming a paradigmatic case of recovery following a high number of infected people, we fitted Portuguese data to biphasic models using non-linear regression and compared the two countries. The results, which suggest good fit, show that recovery in Portugal can be much slower than anticipated, with a very high percentage of active cases (over 50%) remaining still active even months after the projected end of mitigation measures. This, together with the unknown number of asymptomatic carriers, may increase the risk of a much slower recovery if not of new outbreaks. Europe and elsewhere must consider this contingency when planning the relief of containment measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Milhinhos","author_inst":"Green-IT Research Unit, Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa (ITQB NOVA)"},{"author_name":"Pedro M.

The results show that this method provides more accurate results than both the crude CFR and hospital CFR.

It is critical we understand the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions to choose a safe exit strategy. Many current models are not suitable for assessing exit strategies because they do not account for epidemic resurgence when social distancing ends prematurely (e.g., statistical curve fits) nor permit scenario exploration in specific locations. We developed an SEIR-type mechanistic epidemiological model of COVID-19 dynamics to explore temporally variable non-pharmaceutical interventions. We provide an interactive tool and code to estimate the transmission parameter, {beta}, and the effective reproduction number, Reff. We fit the model to Santa Clara County, California, where an early epidemic start date and early shelter-in-place orders could provide a model for other regions. As of April 22, 2020, we estimate an Reff of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.849 - 1.107) in Santa Clara County. After June 1 (the end-date for Santa Clara County shelter-in-place as of April 27), we estimate a shift to partial social distancing, combined with rigorous testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals, is a viable alternative to indefinitely maintaining shelter-in-place. We also estimate that if Santa Clara County had waited one week longer before issuing shelter-in-place orders, 95 additional people would have died by April 22 (95% CI: 7 - 283). Given early life-saving shelter-in-place orders in Santa Clara County, longer-term moderate social distancing and testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals have the potential to contain the size and toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Clara County, and may be effective in other locations.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa L Childs","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Morgan P Kain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Devin Kirk","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Mallory Harris","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Couper","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Nova","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Delwel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20089094","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics and fecal-oral transmission potential of patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20089094","rel_abs":"Background: A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 generate negative pharyngeal swab viral nucleic acid test results but test positive using fecal samples. However, fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 has not been established to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the duration of fecal swab positivity in COVID-19 patients after pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative and to explore its potential for fecal-oral transmission. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical records, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of 17 COVID-19 patients confirmed by laboratory tests from January 22 to February 7, 2020 at a tertiary hospital was performed. The potential of fecal-oral transmission was assessed by detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal swab samples. Results: A total of 16 patients (94.1%) had fever; other symptoms included dry cough, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, sore throat, fatigue, and muscle pain. Three patients had decreased white blood cell counts, 7 had decreased lymphocyte numbers, and 7 had increased C-reactive protein levels. Fecal samples of 11 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, of whom the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was longer in 10 patients than that for pharyngeal swab samples, and only one case exhibited a shorter time for his fecal sample to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative compared to his pharyngeal swab sample. The remaining 6 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal samples. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in both pharyngeal swab and fecal samples, the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was generally longer than that in pharyngeal swab samples. However, there is currently no evidence demonstrating that the virus can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saibin Wang","author_inst":"Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junwei Tu","author_inst":"Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yijun Sheng","author_inst":"Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mallory Harris","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Couper","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Nova","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Delwel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089201","rel_title":"A note on COVID-19 seroprevalence studies: a meta-analysis using hierarchical modelling","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089201","rel_abs":"In recent weeks, several seroprevalence studies have appeared which attempt to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the population of certain European and American locations.

To determine the strength of the signal, we perform a meta-analysis on the publicly available seroprevalence data based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling with prediction sampling. We examine studies with results from Santa Clara County (CA), Los Angeles County (CA), San Miguel County (CO), Chelsea (MA), the comte de Geneve (Switzerland), and Gangelt (Germany). Our results are in broad agreement with the conclusions of the studies; we find that there is evidence for non-trivial levels of antibody prevalence across all study locations. However, we also find that a significant probability mass exists for antibody prevalence at levels lower than the reported figures.

Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown. Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak. However, challenges exist in evaluating the effects of quarantine on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong due to the fact that the effects of border control have to be also taken into account. Methods: We have developed a two-layered susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model which can estimate the effects of quarantine on virus transmissibility after stratifying infections into imported and subsequent community infections, in a region closely connected to the outbreak's source. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 - 3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 - 9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the early quarantine for infected cases before symptom onset is a key factor to prevent COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hsiang-Yu Yuan","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Guiyuan Han","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hsiangkuo Yuan","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Axiu Mao","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Wu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089854","rel_title":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of published research data on COVID-19 infection-fatality rates","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089854","rel_abs":"An important unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the infection-fatality rate (IFR). This differs from the case-fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic. While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy-makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19. Methods Pubmed, Medline, SSRN, and Medrxiv were searched using a set of terms and Boolean operators on 25\/04\/2020 and re-searched 14\/05\/2020, 21\/05\/2020, and 16\/06\/2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by both authors. Meta-analysis was performed in Stata 15.1 using the metan command, based on IFR and confidence intervals extracted from each study. Google\/Google Scholar was used to assess the grey literature relating to government reports. Results After exclusions, there were 26 estimates of IFR included in the final meta-analysis, from a wide range of countries, published between February and June 2020. The meta-analysis demonstrated a point-estimate of IFR of 0.68% (0.53-0.82%) with high heterogeneity (p<0.001). Conclusion Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence on COVID-19 until May, 2020, the IFR of the disease across populations is 0.68% (0.53-0.82%). However, due to very high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to know if this represents the true point estimate. It is likely that, due to age and perhaps underlying comorbidities in the population, different places will experience different IFRs due to the disease. Given issues with mortality recording, it is also likely that this represents an underestimate of the true IFR figure. More research looking at age-stratified IFR is urgently needed to inform policy-making on this front.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Lea Merone","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Hsiangkuo Yuan","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Axiu Mao","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Wu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20080879","rel_title":"Validation of a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological Immunoassay","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20080879","rel_abs":"Aims: To validate the diagnostic accuracy of a Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA immunoassay for COVID-19 disease. Methods: In this unmatched (1:1) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 176 negative controls collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% of them were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had a high diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.992 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.986-0.996) and 0.977 (95%CI: 0.963-0.990), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.008). Considering optimized cut-offs taking the 15% inter-assay imprecision assessed into account, an IgG ratio cut-off > 1.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 98-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 97-100). A 0.5 cut-off displayed a 97% sensitivity (95%CI: 93-99) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 93-99). Adopting these thresholds, rather than those of the manufacturer, improved assay performance, leaving 12% of IgG ratios ranging between 0.5-1.5 as indeterminate. Conclusions: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in a samples of patients, without any obvious gains from considering IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not in our study population. They should however not be considered as a surrogate of protection at this stage.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Giulia Torriani","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Sabine Yerly","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lena Mazza","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Adrien Calame","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Arm-Vernez","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Gert Zimmer","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Thomas Agoritsas","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Stirnemann","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Herve Spechbach","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Pugin","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Pascale Roux-Lombard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lionel Fontao","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Claire-Anne Siegrist","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088484","rel_title":"Effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Maternal, Perinatal and Neonatal Outcomes: a Systematic Review of 266 Pregnancies","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088484","rel_abs":"Objective: To perform a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19 to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until April 20, 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after April 20, 2020). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and\/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient was pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied. Results: We identified several case-reports and case-series but only 19 studies, including a total of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met eligibility criteria and were finally included in the review. In the combined data from seven case-series, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea\/shortness of breath and fatigue. The rate of severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of the cases requiring intensive care unit admission. Almost all cases from the case-series had positive computer tomography chest findings. There were six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only a few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion. 177 cases had delivered, of which the majority by Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight less than 2500 grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. There were 113 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, which was negative for SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe pneumonia, in comparison to nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. Most importantly, in order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Juan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Maria M Gil","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Hospital Universitario de Torrejon, Torrejon de Ardoz, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Zhihui Rong","author_inst":"Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuanzhen Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Clinical Medicine Research Center of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth"},{"author_name":"Huixia Yang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Liona Chiu Yee Poon","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,  Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gert Zimmer","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Thomas Agoritsas","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Stirnemann","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Herve Spechbach","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Pugin","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Pascale Roux-Lombard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lionel Fontao","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Claire-Anne Siegrist","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"obstetrics and gynecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20070581","rel_title":"Psychophysical Olfactory Findings of Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 Patients: Preliminary Report.","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20070581","rel_abs":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 infection, many patients reported sudden loss of smell (SLS).

We sought to evaluate the utilization and diagnostic yield of blood cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine prevalence and common etiologies of bacteremia, and to inform a diagnostic approach to relieve blood culture overutilization. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19. Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the first half of the month. The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than COVID-19 negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%), p < 0.001.  COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, reducing the bacteremia rate to 1.6% when excluded.  More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation. Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial co-infection. Clear communication with ordering providers is necessary to prevent overutilization of blood cultures during COVID-19 surges, and laboratories should consider shortening the incubation period from 5 days to 4 days to free additional capacity.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Sepulveda","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lars F Westblade","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Susan Whittier","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Joseph Satlin","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"William Greendyke","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Justin G Aaron","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jason E.

Few studies have compared these clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 to other acute respiratory illnesses. Methods: We examined all patients presenting to an emergency department in San Francisco, California between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results including viral diagnostics using PCR and mNGS. Among those hospitalized, we determined differences in treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, respiratory support) and outcomes (ICU admission, ICU interventions, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury). Findings: In a cohort of 316 patients, 33 (10%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 patients, all without COVID-19, tested positive for another respiratory virus (16%). Among patients with additional viral testing, no co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified by PCR or mNGS. Patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7 vs. 3 days), and were more likely to report fever (82% vs. 44%), fatigue (85% vs. 50%), and myalgias (61% vs 27%); p<0.001 for all comparisons. Lymphopenia (55% vs 34%, p=0.018) and bilateral opacities on initial chest radiograph (55% vs. 24%, p=0.001) were more common in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79% vs. 56%, p=0.014). Of 186 hospitalized patients, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p<0.001) and were more likely to develop ARDS (23% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Most comorbidities, home medications, signs and symptoms, vital signs, laboratory results, treatment, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses.","rel_num_authors":46,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sachin J Shah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Peter N Barish","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Priya A Prasad","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amy L Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Norma Neff","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Lucy M Li","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Babick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Margaret C Fang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yumiko Abe-Jones","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Narges Alipanah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Francisco N Alvarez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20078642","rel_title":"Impact of ethnicity on outcome of severe COVID-19 infection.

Cases and deaths will increase as the virus continues its global march outward. In the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions or a vaccine, wide-spread virological screening is required to inform where restrictive isolation measures should be targeted and when they can be lifted. However, limitations on testing capacity have restricted the ability of governments and institutions to identify individual clinical cases, appropriately measure community prevalence, and mitigate transmission. Group testing offers a way to increase efficiency, by combining samples and testing a small number of pools. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of group testing designs for individual identification or prevalence estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection when testing capacity is limited. To do this, we developed mathematical models for epidemic spread, incorporating empirically measured individual-level viral kinetics to simulate changing viral loads in a large population over the course of an epidemic. We used these to construct representative populations and assess pooling strategies for community screening, accounting for variability in viral load samples, dilution effects, changing prevalence and resource constraints. We confirmed our group testing framework through pooled tests on de-identified human nasopharyngeal specimens with viral loads representative of the larger population. We show that group testing designs can both accurately estimate overall prevalence using a small number of measurements and substantially increase the identification rate of infected individuals in resource-limited settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"James A Hay","author_inst":"Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brendan Blumenstiel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Stacey Gabriel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lucy M Li","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Babick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Margaret C Fang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yumiko Abe-Jones","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Narges Alipanah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Francisco N Alvarez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20084947","rel_title":"Voluntary Cyclical Distancing: A potential alternative to constant level mandatory social distancing, relying on an 'infection weather report'","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20084947","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has significantly changed our daily lives.

This paper analyzes the utility of various levels of social distancing, and suggests an alternative approach using voluntary distancing informed by an infectious load index or 'infection weather report.'","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Goldman","author_inst":"Promote.Health"},{"author_name":"James A Hay","author_inst":"Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brendan Blumenstiel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Stacey Gabriel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lucy M Li","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Babick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Margaret C Fang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yumiko Abe-Jones","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Narges Alipanah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Francisco N Alvarez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086934","rel_title":"Effect of Alert Level 4 on effective reproduction number: review of international COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086934","rel_abs":"The effective reproduction number, Reff, is an important measure of transmission potential in the modelling of epidemics. It measures the average number of people that will be infected by a single contagious individual. A value of Reff > 1 suggests that an outbreak will occur, while Reff< 1 suggests the virus will die out. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries worldwide are implementing a range of intervention measures, such as population-wide social distancing and case isolation, with the goal of reducing Reff to values below one, to slow or eliminate transmission. We analyse case data from 25 international locations to estimate their Reff values over time and to assess the effectiveness of interventions, equivalent to New Zealand's Alert Levels 1-4, for reducing transmission. Our results show that strong interventions, equivalent to NZ's Alert Level 3 or 4, have been successful at reducing Reff below the threshold for outbreak. In general, countries that implemented strong interventions earlier in their outbreak have managed to maintain case numbers at lower levels. These estimates provide indicative ranges of Reff for each Alert Level, to inform parameters in models of COVID-19 spread under different intervention scenarios in New Zealand and worldwide. Predictions from such models are important for informing policy and decisions on intervention timing and stringency during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Lucy M Li","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Babick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Margaret C Fang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yumiko Abe-Jones","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Narges Alipanah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Francisco N Alvarez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086975","rel_title":"Sex-specific differences in COVID-19 testing, cases and outcomes: a population-wide study in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086975","rel_abs":"In this population-wide study in Ontario, Canada we report on all 194,372 unique residents who received testing for SARS-CoV-2 between January 23, 2020 and April 28, 2020.

These findings were consistent even with age adjustment, suggesting that the observed differences in outcomes between women and men were not explained by age or systematic differences in testing by sex.

Method: A polynomial function was applied to daily Apple and Docomo data to calculate the observed R(t). Results: The correlation coefficient among Apple and Docomo data was 0.91. The adjusted coefficient of determination for R(t) for the whole study period was higher using Docomo data than when Apple data were used. When we regressed R(t) on daily Apple and Docomo data simultaneously, the estimated coefficient of Docomo data was not significant. Discussion and Conclusion: We demonstrated that Apple mobility data might be superior to Docomo data for explaining the entire course of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junko Kurita","author_inst":"Department of Nursing , Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tamie Sugawara","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Ohkusa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Michael Hillmer","author_inst":"Ontario Ministry of Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paula A.

This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of face mask in community settings in slowing the spread of respiratory viruses such as SARS- CoV-2. Methods The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search using PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database were performed using Medical subject heading (MeSH) words from the year 2000-2020. The articles focused on the use of masks and N95 respirators in healthcare workers were excluded. Results A total of 305 records were identified, out of which 14 articles were included in the review based upon quality and eligibility criteria. All the articles mentioned about the role of face masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, in the community or experimental setting. Studies also suggested that early initiation of face mask usage was more effective. Masks were also reported to be more effective in viruses that transmit easily from asymptomatic individuals, as is now known in SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Theoretical, experimental, and clinical evidence suggested that usage of face masks in a general population offered significant benefit in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses especially in the pandemic situation, but its utility is limited by inconsistent adherence to mask usage.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MADHU GUPTA","author_inst":"postgraduate institute of medical education and research"},{"author_name":"Khushi Gupta","author_inst":"The Shri Ram School, Gurugram"},{"author_name":"Sarika Gupta","author_inst":"Saral Diagnostic center, Pitampura, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Michael Hillmer","author_inst":"Ontario Ministry of Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paula A.

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal. The results suggest that only the scientific, but contextually appropriate messages about the disease should be disseminated to reduce unnecessary fears and anxiety. Awareness interventions to promote mental well-being need to be integrated into the response interventions. Community mental health care should be made accessible to at-risk groups.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anil Sigdel","author_inst":"Chitwan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Anu Bista","author_inst":"Family Planning Association of Nepal"},{"author_name":"Navaraj Bhattarai","author_inst":"Little Buddha College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bimal Chandra Poon","author_inst":"Nick Simon Institute, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Govind Giri","author_inst":"Nobel College"},{"author_name":"Hannah Marqusee","author_inst":"Independent Consultant"},{"author_name":"subash Thapa","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Babick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Margaret C Fang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yumiko Abe-Jones","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Narges Alipanah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Francisco N Alvarez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087031","rel_title":"Cancer is associated with the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087031","rel_abs":"Background: Cancer patients are considered a highly vulnerable population in the COVID-19 epidemic, but the relationship between cancer and the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 and to examine whether cancer patients with COVID-19 may be at an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search in seven databases was performed, to identified studies reporting the prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients, or providing data of cancer between patients with severe or non-severe illness or between non-survivors and survivors. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence and odds risk (OR) using the inverse variance method with the random-effects model. Results: Thirty-four studies with 8080 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.0% (95% CI: 2.0% to 3.0%). The prevalence in Italy (5.0%), France (6.0%), and Korea (4.0%) were higher than that in China (2.0%). Cancer was associated with a 2.84-fold significantly increased risk of severe illness (OR = 2.84, 95%CI: 1.75 to 4.62, P < 0.001) and a 2.60-fold increased risk of death (OR = 2.60, 95%CI: 1.28 to 5.26, P = 0.008) in patients with COVID-19. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable after excluding studies with a sample size of less than 100. Conclusions: Cancer patients have an increased risk of COVID-19 and cancer was associated with a significantly increased risk of severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ya Gao Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuzhen Shi","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Yamin Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Nursing Center, School of Nursing, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Sun","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Nursing Center, School of Nursing, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Ji Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Nursing Center, School of Nursing, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Tian Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Babick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Margaret C Fang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yumiko Abe-Jones","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Narges Alipanah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Francisco N Alvarez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087080","rel_title":"Early phases of COVID-19 are characterized by a reduction of lymphocyte populations and the presence of atypical monocytes","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087080","rel_abs":"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a recently discovered pathogen responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The immunological changes associated with this infection are largely unknown. Methods We evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells profile of 63 patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis and the presence of association with inflammatory biomarkers and 28-days mortality. Results Lymphocytopenia was present in 51 of 63 (80.9%) patients. This reduction was mirrored also on CD8+ lymphocytes (128 cells\/uL), natural killer cells (67 cells\/uL) and natural killer T cells (31 cells\/uL). Monocytes were preserved in total number but displayed a subpopulation composed mainly of cells with a reduced expression of both CD14 and HLA-DR. A direct correlation was found between serum values of IL-6 and the frequency of Th2 lymphocytes (R=0.17; p=0.04) but not with the monocytes count (R=0.01; p=0.60). Patients who died in the 28 days from admission (N=10, 15.9%), when compared to those who did not, displayed lower mean values of CD3+ (p=0.028) and CD4+ cells (p=0.042) and higher mean percentages of CD8+\/CD38+\/HLA-DR+ lymphocytes (p=0.026). Conclusions The early phases of COVID-19 are characterized by lymphocytopenia, predominance of Th2 lymphocytes and less immunocompetent monocytes, which include atypical mononuclear cells.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ANDREA LOMBARDI","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Elena Trombetta","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Cattaneo","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Valeria Castelli","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Palomba","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Mario Tirone","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Davide Mangioni","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lamorte","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Maria Manunta","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Ferruccio Ceriotti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Roberta Gualtierotti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Costantino","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Stefano Aliberti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Vittorio Scaravilli","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Grasselli","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gori","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Laura Porretti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Bandera","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087114","rel_title":"Lung disease severity, Coronary Artery Calcium, Coronary inflammation and Mortality in Coronavirus Disease 2019.","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087114","rel_abs":"The authors have withdrawn this manuscript at the request of their local IRB, because the objectives outlined in this study were not specifically approved by the IRB.

Many clinical trials have been initiated with existing medications, but assessments of the expected plasma and lung exposures at the selected doses have not featured in the prioritisation process. Although no antiviral data is currently available for the major phenolic circulating metabolite of nitazoxanide (known as tizoxanide), the parent ester drug has been shown to exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nitazoxanide is an anthelmintic drug and its metabolite tizoxanide has been described to have broad antiviral activity against influenza and other coronaviruses. The present study used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to inform optimal doses of nitazoxanide capable of maintaining plasma and lung tizoxanide exposures above the reported nitazoxanide 90% effective concentration (EC90) against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A whole-body PBPK model was constructed for oral administration of nitazoxanide and validated against available tizoxanide pharmacokinetic data for healthy individuals receiving single doses between 500 mg SARS-CoV-2 4000 mg with and without food. Additional validation against multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data when given with food was conducted. The validated model was then used to predict alternative doses expected to maintain tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported nitazoxanide EC90 in >90% of the simulated population. Optimal design software PopDes was used to estimate an optimal sparse sampling strategy for future clinical trials. Results: The PBPK model was validated with AAFE values between 1.01 SARS-CoV-2 1.58 and a difference less than 2-fold between observed and simulated values for all the reported clinical doses. The model predicted optimal doses of 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg TID, 2900 mg BID in the fasted state and 700 mg QID, 900 mg TID and 1400 mg BID when given with food, to provide tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported in vitro EC90 of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2. For BID regimens an optimal sparse sampling strategy of 0.25, 1, 3 and 12h post dose was estimated. Conclusion: The PBPK model predicted that it was possible to achieve plasma and lung tizoxanide concentrations, using proven safe doses of nitazoxanide, that exceed the EC90 for SARS-CoV-2. The PBPK model describing tizoxanide plasma pharmacokinetics after oral administration of nitazoxanide was successfully validated against clinical data. This dose prediction assumes that the tizoxanide metabolite has activity against SARS-CoV-2 similar to that reported for nitazoxanide, as has been reported for other viruses. The model and the reported dosing strategies provide a rational basis for the design (optimising plasma and lung exposures) of future clinical trials of nitazoxanide in the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajith KR Rajoli","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Henry Pertinez","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Usman Arshad","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Helen Box","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Lee Tatham","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Curley","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Neary","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths immediately indicate that countries like Italy and Spain have the worst situation as of mid April 2020, on its own, reported cases do not provide a correct picture of the situation. The reason is that different countries diagnose diversely and present very distinctive reported case fatality rate (CFR). The same levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying picture. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain an uniform unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empiric. The key assumption of the method is that the real CFR in Europe of COVID-19 is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol has a dynamic nature, and it has been giving converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as of mid April 2020. From this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain an Effective Potential Growth (EPG) updated everyday providing an unbiased assessment of the countries with more potential to have an uncontrolled situation. The method developed will be used to track possible improvements on the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marti Catala","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya \/  Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia (CMCiB)"},{"author_name":"David Pino","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Miquel Marchena","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pablo Palacios","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Tomas Urdiales","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pere-Joan Cardona","author_inst":"Experimental Tuberculosis Unit (UTE).

The time varying reproduction number was estimated using EpiEstim package in R programming language. The reproduction number has come down significantly during the lockdown period both at national level and in most states but it was not reduced to less than 1. This calls for urgent need for more effective control measures in addition to lockdown to stop the epidemic spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Padmanaban Venkatesan","author_inst":"Christian Medical College"},{"author_name":"David Pino","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Miquel Marchena","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pablo Palacios","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Tomas Urdiales","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pere-Joan Cardona","author_inst":"Experimental Tuberculosis Unit (UTE).
