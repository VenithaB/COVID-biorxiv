In particular, we verify a given clustering result for the GISAID data set, which was obtained analyzing the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic trees. For this purpose, we use alignment-free dissimilarity measures for sequences and combine them with learning vector quantization classifiers for virus type discriminant analysis and classification. Those vector quantizers belong to the class of interpretable machine learning methods, which, on the one hand side provide additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations, and on the other hand can be equipped with a reject option. This option gives the model the property of self controlled evidence if applied to new data, i.e. the models refuses to make a classification decision, if the model evidence for the presented data is not given. After training such a classifier for the GISAID data set, we apply the obtained classifier model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus data set. On the one hand side, this allows us to assign new sequences to already known virus types and, on the other hand, the rejected sequences allow speculations about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences.\n\nAuthor summaryThe currently emerging global disease COVID-19 caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses requires all scientific effort to investigate the development of the viral epidemy, the properties of the virus and its types. Investigations of the virus sequence are of special interest. Frequently, those are based on mathematical\/statistical analysis. However, machine learning methods represent a promising alternative, if one focuses on interpretable models, i.e. those that do not act as black-boxes. Doing so, we apply variants of Learning Vector Quantizers to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We encoded the sequences and compared them in their numerical representations to avoid the computationally costly comparison based on sequence alignments. Our resulting model is interpretable, robust, efficient, and has a self-controlling mechanism regarding the applicability to data. This framework was applied to two data sets concerning SARS-CoV-2. We were able to verify previously published virus type findings for one of the data sets by training our model to accurately identify the virus type of sequences. For sequences without virus type information (second data set), our trained model can predict them. Thereby, we observe a new scattered spreading of the sequences in the data space which probably is caused by mutations in the viral sequences.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Villmann","author_inst":"University of Applied Sciences Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Marika Kaden","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Katrin  Sophie Bohnsack","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Mirko Weber","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Mateusz Kudla","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Kaja Gutowska","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"},{"author_name":"Jacek Blazewicz","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20096834","rel_title":"Triage tool for suspected COVID-19 patients in the emergency room: AIFELL score","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20096834","rel_abs":"Clinical prediction scores support the assessment of patients in the emergency setting to determine the need for further diagnostic and therapeutic steps. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, physicians in emergency rooms (ER) of many hospitals have a considerably higher patient load and need to decide within a short time frame whom to hospitalize. Based on our clinical experiences in dealing with COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital Zurich, we created a triage score with the acronym AIFELL consisting of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. The score was then evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 122 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 from March until mid-April 2020. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, ANOVA and Scheffe's post hoc analysis confirmed the diagnostic power of the score. The results suggest that the AIFELL score has potential as a triage tool in the ER setting intended to select probable COVID-19 cases for hospitalization in spontaneously presenting or referred patients with acute respiratory symptoms.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ian Levenfus","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Enrico Ullmann","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Edouard Battegay","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mac\u00e9 M.

Moreover, very limited information is available about SARS-CoV-2 expressed regions and immune responses. In this paper an effort has been made, to facilitate vaccine development by proposing multiple epitopes as potential vaccine candidates by utilising SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome data. Here, publicly available RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHBE and A549 human cell lines were used to construct SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome to understand disease pathogenesis and immune responses. In the first step, epitope prediction, MHC class I and II gene identification for epitopes, population coverage, antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservation and crossreactivity analysis with host antigens were performed by using SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, and in the second step, structural compatibility of identified T-and B-cell epitopes were evaluated with MHC molecules and B-cell receptors through molecular docking studies. Quantification of MHC gene expression was also performed that indicated high variation in allele types and expression level of MHC genes with respect to cell lines. In A549 cell line, HLA-A*30:01:01:01 and HLA-B*44:03:01:01 were highly expressed, whereas 92 variants of HLA-A*24 genes such as HLA-A*24:02:01:01, HLA-A*24:286, HLA-A*24:479Q, HLA-A*24:02:134 and HLA-A*24:02:116 were highly expressed in NHBE cell lines. Prevalence of HLA-A*24 alleles was suggested as risk factors for H1N1 infection, and associated with type-1 diabetes. HLA-C*03:03, linked with male infertility factors was also highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cell lines. Finally, three potential T-cell and five B-cell epitopes were selected for molecular docking studies with twenty-two MHC molecules and two B-cell receptors respectively. The results of in silico analysis indicated that proposed epitopes have high potential to recognize immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study will facilitate in vitro and in vivo vaccine related research studies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sandeep Kumar Kushwaha Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Veerbhan Kesarwani Jr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Samraggi Choudhury Jr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sonu Gandhi Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Sharma Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kaja Gutowska","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"},{"author_name":"Jacek Blazewicz","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20097469","rel_title":"Covasim: an agent-based model of COVID-19 dynamics and interventions","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20097469","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs.

A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. Purpose: This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Results: Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Conclusions: Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcio Dorn","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Avila","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Clarice Sampaio Alho","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Kahmann","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande"},{"author_name":"Gregory Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rosenfeld","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

The model extends a basic epidemiological model and assumes that a specified fraction of a population dons masks at a given initial number of infections. The model includes a contribution from the ocular (nasolacrimal duct) route, and does not include contributions from contact (fomite) routes. The model accommodates dose-response (probability of infection) functions that are linear or non-linear. Our motivation to study near-population-wide mask wearing arises from the concept that, between two mask wearers, the concentration of particles at inhalation should be the square of the mask penetration fraction. This combination, or team, of masks can provide a strong dose-lowering squaring effect, which enables the use of lower-efficiency, lower-cost, lower pressure-drop (easier breathing) masks. For an epidemic with basic reproduction number R0=2.5 and with a linear dose-response, the critical mask efficiency is calculated to be 0.5 for a mask adoption level of 0.8 of the population. Importantly, this efficiency is well below that of a N95 mask, and well above that of some fabric masks. Numerical solutions of the model at near-critical levels of mask efficiency and mask adoption demonstrate avoidance of epidemics. To be conservative we use mask efficiencies measured with the most-penetrating viral-particle sizes. The critical mask adoption level for surgical masks with an efficiency of 0.58 is computed to be 0.73. With surgical masks (or equally efficient substitutes) and 80% and 90% adoption levels, respiratory epidemics with R0 of about 3 and 4, respectively, would be theoretically extinguished.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alan D Kot","author_inst":"Independent Research"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Avila","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Clarice Sampaio Alho","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Kahmann","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande"},{"author_name":"Gregory Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rosenfeld","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

However, even if most social distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of social distancing. We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy (CTS) to be successful. Methods We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing delay). The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if positive, with different delays (tracing delay) and coverages (tracing coverage). We computed effective reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts. Findings For the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 80%), and assuming that around 40% of transmission occur before symptom onset, the model predicts that the effective reproduction number of 1.2 (with social distancing only) will be reduced to 0.8 by adding contact tracing. A testing delay of 2 days requires tracing delay to be at most 1 day, or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1. With a testing\/isolation delay of 3 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below 1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and ranges from up to 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 42% with a 3-day testing delay and 18% with a 5-day testing delay. Interpretation In our model, minimizing testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward transmissions. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced CTS effectiveness, with a potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. Access to testing should therefore be optimized, and mobile app technology may reduce delays in the CTS process and optimize contact tracing coverage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mirjam E Kretzschmar","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Ganna Rozhnova","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Martin Bootsma","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Michiel E van Boven","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Janneke van de Wijgert","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Marc Bonten","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes. Findings Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (49.5%), 69.4% had no signs of infection and 94.6% were afebrile. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study cutoff date. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort. Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first large retrospective cohort study observing the characteristics of the initial consecutive COVID-19 patients of an entire country. Further, large proportion of asymptomatic patients provides novel insights into the clinical features of patients with milder disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sulaiman Almazeedi","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah Al Youha","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohammad H Jamal","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohannad Al-Haddad","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ali Al-Muhaini","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fahad Al-Ghimlas","author_inst":"Public Health Administration, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Salman Al-Sabah","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

The reference method is using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays, with limitations that may curb its prompt large-scale application. COVID-19 manifests with chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities, some even before the onset of symptoms. We tested the hypothesis that application of deep learning (DL) to the 3D CT images could help identify COVID-19 infections. Using the data from 920 COVID-19 and 1,073 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, we developed a modified DenseNet-264 model, COVIDNet, to classify CT images to either class. When tested on an independent set of 233 COVID-19 and 289 non-COVID-19 patients. COVIDNet achieved an accuracy rate of 94.3% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. Application of DL to CT images may improve both the efficiency and capacity of case detection and long-term surveillance.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bohan Liu","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

The articles that had assessed outcomes of pregnancy and perinatal of women with COVID-19 between Oct 2019 and Apr 30, 2020 without language limitation were considered. All kinds of studies such as case report, case series, retrospective cohort, case control were included. We searched databases, selected relevant studies and extracted data regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes from each article. Data of 287 pregnant women with COVID-19 of 6 countries were assessed from 28 articles between December 8, 2019 and April 6, 2020. Most pregnant women reported in their third trimester, 102 (35.5%) cases were symptomatic at the time of admission. Common onset symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, and chest computed tomography pattern were fever (51.5%), lymphocytopenia (67.9%), and multiple ground-glass opacities (78.5%) respectively. 93% of all deliveries were done through cesarean section. No maternal mortality and 3 % ICU admission were reported. Vertical transmission was not reported but its possibility was suggested in three neonates. One neonatal death, one stillbirth, and one abortion were reported. All newborns were not breastfed. This review showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in comparison with previous coronavirus outbreak infection in pregnancy. Limited data are available regarding possibility of virus transmission in utero, during vaginal childbirth and breastfeeding. Effect of COVID-19 on first and second trimester and ongoing pregnancy outcomes in infected mothers is still questionable.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatemeh Azarkish","author_inst":"Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Iranshahr University of Medical Sciences, Iranshahr, Iran"},{"author_name":"Roksana Janghorban","author_inst":"Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Maternal-Fetal Medicine Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Lutao Dai","author_inst":"Faculty of Business and Economics, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yanlin Yang","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tiantan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Xie","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Suizhou Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine (Suizhou Central Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Yiqing Tan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Third Hospital, Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jicheng Du","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, WenZhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Shan","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chenghui Zhao","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

COVID-19 infection has limited preventive or therapeutic drug options at this stage. Some of common existing drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been hypothesised to impact on disease severity. However, up till now, no studies investigating this association were conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups, i.e. older people residing in nursing homes. The purpose of this study has been to explore the association of ACEi\/ARB and\/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19 infected older people residing in nursing homes. Methods and Findings. We undertook a retrospective multi-centre cohort study in two Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. COVID-19 diagnoses were based on clinical suspicion and\/or viral presence using PCR of nasopharyngeal samples. A total of 154 COVID-19 positive subjects was identified. The outcomes were defined as 1) serious COVID-19 defined as a long-stay hospital admission (length of stay [&ge;] 7 days) or death (at hospital or nursing home) within 14 days of disease onset, and 2) asymptomatic, i.e. no disease symptoms in the whole study-period while still being PCR diagnosed. Disease symptoms were defined as any COVID-19-related clinical symptom (e.g. coughing, dyspnoea, sore throat) or sign (low oxygen saturation and fever) for [&ge;] 2 days out of 3 consecutive days. Logistic regression models with Firth corrections were applied on these 154 subjects to analyse the association between ACEi\/ARB and\/or statin use with the outcomes. Age, sex, functional status, diabetes and hypertension were used as covariates. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of our statistical significant findings. We found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 infection (unadjusted OR 2.91; CI 1.27-6.71; p=0.011), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, functional status, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The strength of this association was considerable and clinically important. Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome (long-stay hospitalisation or death) were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.25-1.85; p=0.556). There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi\/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 1.52; CI 0.62-3.50; p=0.339) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.79; CI 0.26-1.95; p=0.629). Conclusions. Our data indicate that statin intake in old, frail people could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 related clinical symptoms. The role of statins and any interaction with renin-angiotensin system drugs need to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomised clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anton De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Antoon Bronselaer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Geert Byttebier","author_inst":"Bioconstat BV, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guy De Tre","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Luc Belmans","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Evelien Wynendaele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Christophe Van De Wiele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Filip Vandaele","author_inst":"VZW Zorg-Saam Zusters Kindsheid Jesu, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Diemer Van Dijck","author_inst":"Corilus Health IT Center, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fedson","author_inst":"Former University of Virginia, USA"},{"author_name":"Bart De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Wang","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

Surgical smoke can act as a carrier for tissue particles, viruses, and bacteria. To quantify airborne transmission from a physical point of view, we consider surgical smoke produced by thermal destruction of tissue during the use of electrosurgical instruments as a marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation. Surgical smoke plumes are also known to be dangerous for human health, especially to surgical staff who receive long-term exposure over the years. There are limited quantified metrics reported on long-term effects of surgical smoke on staff's health. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework and experimental protocol to assess the transport and diffusion of hazardous airborne particles in every large operating room suite. Measurements from a network of air quality sensors gathered during a clinical study provide validation for the main part of the model. Overall, the model estimates staff exposure to airborne contamination from surgical smoke and biological material. To address the clinical implication over a long period of time, the systems approach is built upon previous work on multi-scale modeling of surgical flow in a large operating room suite and takes into account human behavior factors.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc Garbey","author_inst":"The Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Joerger","author_inst":"ORintelligence, GEPROVAS"},{"author_name":"Shannon Furr","author_inst":"ORintelligence"},{"author_name":"Geert Byttebier","author_inst":"Bioconstat BV, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guy De Tre","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Luc Belmans","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Evelien Wynendaele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Christophe Van De Wiele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Filip Vandaele","author_inst":"VZW Zorg-Saam Zusters Kindsheid Jesu, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Diemer Van Dijck","author_inst":"Corilus Health IT Center, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fedson","author_inst":"Former University of Virginia, USA"},{"author_name":"Bart De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Wang","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

Design: Retrospective cohort study with data extracted from the electronic records of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution. Setting: Suburban general hospital serving the most populous London borough. Participants: The first 450 inpatients admitted to our hospital with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Primary outcome: The primary outcome measure was death during the index hospital admission. Results: The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male. Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere. The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local population with no excess of BAME deaths. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%. Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p <0.001). 31 (7%) of patients were classified as having hospital-onset COVID-19 infection. The peak of hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted infections. Despite being older and more frail, the outcomes for this cohort were no worse. Conclusions: Inpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who were more likely to present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying population. While a significant number of patients presented with COVID-19 while already in hospital, their outcomes were no worse.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon E Brill","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Jarvis","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ezgi Ozcan","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Thomas Burns","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rabia Warraich","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lisa Amani","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Amina Jaffer","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Paget","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Anand Sivaramakrishnan","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dean Creer","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Diemer Van Dijck","author_inst":"Corilus Health IT Center, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fedson","author_inst":"Former University of Virginia, USA"},{"author_name":"Bart De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Wang","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

Thus, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The patient recruitment phase finished at the end of August 2020, and the follow-up continues by the end of August 2021. The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered main secondary outcomes. Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57 {+\/-} 15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The Cox proportional-hazards model for PCEP indicated the following significant risk factors: Oxygen saturation < 80% (HR= 6.3; [CI 95%: 2.5,15.5]), lymphopenia (HR= 3.5; [CI 95%: 2.2,5.5]), Oxygen saturation 80%-90% (HR= 2.5; [CI 95%: 1.1,5.8]), and thrombocytopenia (HR= 1.6; [CI 95%: 1.1,2.5]).

However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden. Design: We make use of Swedish register data about total weekly deaths, total population at risk, and estimate age- and sex-specific weekly death rates for 2020 and the 5 previous years. The data is provided by Statistics Sweden. Results: From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. Persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women at all ages with 75% higher death rates for males and 50% higher for females. Current excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women. Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic has so far had a clear and consistent effect on total mortality in Sweden, with male death rates being comparably more affected. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on mortality and life expectancy will depend on the progression of the pandemic, the extent that some of the deaths would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic, only somewhat later, the consequences for other health conditions, as well as the health care sector at large.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karin Modig","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Ebeling","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Babak Amra","author_inst":"Bamdad Respiratory research center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Zohreh Naderi","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, University of Medical Science, Isfahan University, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Shaghayegh Haghjooy Javanmard","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Applied Physiology Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isf"},{"author_name":"Bijan Iraj","author_inst":"Isfahan Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Somayeh Haji Ahmadi","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Azin Shayganfar","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehrnegar Dehghan","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Nilufar Khademi","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Nastaran Sadat Hosseini","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mojgan Mortazavi","author_inst":"Isfahan kidney diseases research center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Marjan Mansourian","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC)"},{"author_name":"Miquel Angel Mananas","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Hamid Reza Marateb","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Peyman Adibi","author_inst":"Digestive Diseases Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Xia Fu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District"},{"author_name":"Yanqing Fan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Li","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Affiliated Hospital of Putian University"},{"author_name":"Na Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"1.Department of Radiology, Wuhan Huangpi People's Hospital;

Due to hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected two dialogue datasets - CovidDialog - (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size, which bear high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets. Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogue about COVID-19. But more advanced approaches are needed to build a fully useful dialogue system that can offer accurate COVID-related consultations.

Today, it appears as a threat to human civilization. Scientists and medical practitioners across the world are involved to trace out the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019 novel coronavirus and referred as 2019-nCoV), its transmission route, cause of pathogenicity, and possible remedial action. In this work, we aim to find out the origin, evolutionary patternthat led to its pathogenicity and possible transmission pathway of 2019-nCoV. To achieve the aims we conducted a large-scale deep phylogenetic analysis on the 162 complete Orthocoronavirinae genomes consisting of four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, their gene trees analysis and subsequently genome and gene recombination analyses. Our analyses revealed that i) bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, ii) outbreak of 2019-nCoV took place via inter-intra species transmission mode, iii) host-specific adaptive mutation made 2019-nCoV more virulent, and the presence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and\/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOrthocoronavirinae genome phylogeny revealed that bat, pangolin and anteater are natural reservoir hosts of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV\/SARS-CoV-2).\nC_LIO_LIHost-specific adaptive mutation occurred among the coronaviruses.\nC_LIO_LITransmission of 2019-nCoV to human took place by inter-intra species mode of transmission.\nC_LIO_LIPresence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and\/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amresh Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"University of Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Anup Som","author_inst":"University of Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Bowen Tan","author_inst":"CMU"},{"author_name":"Zeqian Ju","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Subrato Chakravorty","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xuehai He","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Shu Chen","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xingyi Yang","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Qingyang Wu","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Zhou Yu","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Eric Xing","author_inst":"CMU"},{"author_name":"Pengtao Xie","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Marjan Mansourian","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC)"},{"author_name":"Miquel Angel Mananas","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Hamid Reza Marateb","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Peyman Adibi","author_inst":"Digestive Diseases Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Xia Fu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District"},{"author_name":"Yanqing Fan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Li","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Affiliated Hospital of Putian University"},{"author_name":"Na Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"1.Department of Radiology, Wuhan Huangpi People's Hospital;

Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal neutralizing titers ranging from undetectable in 33% to below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) as low as single digit ng\/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","rel_num_authors":46,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide F.

We have solved the crystal structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex bound to the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin in the active site. Based on the structural data we built a model of the MTase in complex with RNA that illustrates the catalytic reaction. A structural comparison to the Zika MTase revealed low conservation of the catalytic site between these two RNA viruses suggesting preparation of inhibitors targeting both these viruses will be very difficult.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2.Methods To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, lung, and kidney of rats through immunohistochemistry.Results Strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the nasal respiratory epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, alveoli, kidney, and taste buds of the tongue. Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was much stronger in the peripheral alveoli than in the central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, respiratory dysfunction, and acute nephropathy.Conclusions A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Differential distribution of TMPRSS2 in the lung indicated the COVID-19 symptoms to possibly be exacerbated by TMPRSS2 expression. This study might provide potential clues for further investigation of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Level of Evidence NACompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rumi Ueha","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Taku Sato","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Takao Goto","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Akihito Yamauchi","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Kenji Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Yamasoba","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Barnes","author_inst":"Caltech"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Finkin","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hagglof","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Thiago Oliveira","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Viant","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Arlene Hurley","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Katrina Millard","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Rhonda Kost","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Kristie Gordon","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Filippo Bianchini","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Spencer Chen","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Victor Ramos","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Roshni Patel","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Juan Dizon","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Irina Shimeliovich","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Mendoza","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Harald Hartweger","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Lilian Nogueira","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Maggi Pack","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Jill Horowitz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yiska Weisblum","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Alison Ashbrook","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Eric F.

To infect cells, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host airway cells. Increased ACE2 expression in lower airway cells in active smokers, suggests a potential mechanism whereby PM10 increases vulnerability to COVID-19 disease.Objective To assess the effect of traffic-derived PM10 on human airway epithelial cell ACE2 expression in vitro.Methods PM10 was collected from Marylebone Road (London) using a kerbside impactor. A549 and human primary nasal epithelial cells were cultured with PM10 for 2 h, and ACE2 expression (median fluorescent intensity; MFI) assessed by flow cytometry. We included cigarette smoke extract as a putative positive control. Data were analysed by either Mann-Whitney test, or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test.Results PM10 at 10 \u03bcg\/mL, and 20 \u03bcg\/mL increased ACE2 expression in A549 cells (P&lt;0.05, 0.01 vs. medium control, respectively). Experiments using a single PM10 concentration (10 \u03bcg\/mL), found increased ACE2 expression in both A549 cells (control vs. PM10, median (IQR) MFI; 470 (0.1 to 1114) vs 6217 (5071 to 8506), P&lt;0.01), and in human primary epithelial cells (0 (0 to 591) vs. 4000 (2610 to 7853), P&lt;0.05). Culture of A549 cells with 5% cigarette smoke extract increased ACE2 expression (n=4, 0 (0 to 28) vs. 9088 (7557 to 15831, P&lt;0.05).Conclusion Traffic-related PM10 increases the expression of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human respiratory epithelial cells.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisa Miyashita","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Gary Foley","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Sean Semple","author_inst":"University of Sterling, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Grigg","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Kenji Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Yamasoba","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Marianna Agudelo","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Barnes","author_inst":"Caltech"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Finkin","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hagglof","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Thiago Oliveira","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Viant","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Arlene Hurley","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Katrina Millard","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Rhonda Kost","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cipolla","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Anna Gazumyan","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Kristie Gordon","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Filippo Bianchini","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Spencer Chen","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Victor Ramos","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Roshni Patel","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Juan Dizon","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Irina Shimeliovich","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Mendoza","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Harald Hartweger","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Lilian Nogueira","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Maggi Pack","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Jill Horowitz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yiska Weisblum","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Alison Ashbrook","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Eric F.

We identified the subtypes based on the phylogenetic clustering in comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the first thirty SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and sequenced in Turkey. We suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is earlier than the first reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are dispersed among most types in the phylogenetic tree. We find two of the seventeen sub-clusters enriched with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the country. Finally, we traced virus genomes based on their phylogenetic placements.

The viral RNA encodes non structural protein Nsp13 or the viral helicase protein that helps the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to execute RNA replication by unwinding the RNA duplexes. In this study we identified a novel mutation at position 541of the helicase where the tyrosine (Y) got substituted with cytosine (C). We found that Y541C is a destabilizing mutation increasing the molecular flexibility and leading to decreased affinity of helicase binding with RNA. Earlier we had reported a mutation P504L in the helicase protein for which had not performed RNA binding study. Here we report that P504L mutation leads to increased affinity of helicase RNA interaction. So, both these mutations have opposite effects on RNA binding.

In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay limit of detection was comparable to central laboratory reverse-transcription quantitative PCR tests with observed SARS-CoV-2 detection below 100 copies\/mL. The Xpert(R) Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies\/mL were diluted into six sample pools. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted by population public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care test site and should be determined by assessing positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael G.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a recent zoonotic infection that has quickly reached pandemic proportions2,3. Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses is thought to occur in the absence of pre-existing immunity in the target human population. Using diverse assays for detection of antibodies reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, we demonstrate the presence of pre-existing humoral immunity in uninfected and unexposed humans to the new coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies were readily detectable by a sensitive flow cytometry-based method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals and were particularly prevalent in children and adolescents. These were predominantly of the IgG class and targeted the S2 subunit. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, targeting both the S1 and S2 subunits, as well as concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies, lasting throughout the observation period of 6 weeks since symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera also variably reacted with SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleoprotein (N), but not with the S1 subunit or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S on standard enzyme immunoassays. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera exhibited specific neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes, according to levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera. Distinguishing pre-existing and de novo antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for our understanding of susceptibility to and the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin W Ng","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Faulkner","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Georgina Cornish","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Annachiara Rosa","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ruth Harvey","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Saira Hussain","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Rachel Ulferts","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Earl","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Antoni Wrobel","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Donald Benton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Chloe Roustan","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"William Bolland","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Rachael Thompson","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ana Agua-Doce","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Philip Hobson","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Judith Heaney","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rickman","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Stavroula Paraskevopoulou","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Catherine F Houlihan","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust;

The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19.\n\nMethodsWe performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status.\n\nResultsACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in both, epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related with age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Urszula Radzikowska","author_inst":"Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, University of Zurich and Christine-Kuhne - Center for Research and Education, Davos, Switzerland;

However, as for any virus, SARS-CoV-2 is subject to constant selection pressure, with new Mpro mutations arising over time. Identification and structural characterization of Mpro variants is thus critical for robust inhibitor design. Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventy-nine Mpro variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas J Cross","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Gemma R Takahashi","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Diessner","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Marquise G Crosby","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Vesta Farahmand","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Shannon Zhuang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Carter Tribley Butts","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rachel W Martin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Hideaki Morita","author_inst":"Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, University of Zurich, Davos, Switzerland;
