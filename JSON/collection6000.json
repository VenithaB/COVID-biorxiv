Today, isolation policy is enforced by identifying infected individuals based on symptoms when these appear or by testing people and quarantining those who have been in close contact with infected people. In addition, many countries have imposed complete or partial lock-downs to control the spread of the disease. While this has resulted in some some success in slowing down the spread of the virus, lock-downs as well as widespread quarantine have devastating effects on the economy and social life. Thus, governments are urgently looking for efficient strategies to significantly relax lock-downs, while still controlling the spread of the virus. We argue that this can be done by using active feedback to control testing for infection by actively testing individuals with a high probability of being infected. We develop an active testing strategy to achieve this goal, and demonstrate that it would have tremendous success in controlling the spread of the virus on one million people, using 3; 000 tests per day. Our results show up to a 50% reduction in quarantine rate and morbidity rate in typical settings as compared to existing methods.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kobi Cohen","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Amir Leshem","author_inst":"Bar-Ilan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089193","rel_title":"Linear regression analysis of COVID-19 outbreak and control in Henan province caused by the output population from Wuhan","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089193","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives: To observe outbreak of COVID-19 in Henan province caused by the output population from Wuhan, and high-grade control measures were proformed in Henan province, to study the phase of development and change of the epidemic in Henan province, and to make appropriate inferences about the influence of prevention and control measures and the phase of development of the epidemic. Methods: Linear regression analysis were used to establish a linear regression model with the number of Wuhan roaming people as the dependent variable and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Henan province as the dependent variable, and to calculate and plot the regional distribution of the number of cases in 18 cities in Henan province in accordance with the criteria of whether the number of cases exceeded the expected number. Results: There was a linear correlation between the number of people Wuhan roaming and the number of cases, and the linear regression model equation was statistically significant. The cities that exceeded the expected number of cases had a clear spatio-temporal distribution. Geographically, these cities were roughly in the 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock directions in Nanyang, and in terms of time period, the first phase (10 days), the cities that exceeded the expected number of cases changed almost daily. In the second phase (5 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases were moderated, and in the third phase (15 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases entered the stabilization phase. Conclusions: The priority cities for COVID-19 prevention and control in Henan province should pay special attention to the cities that have exceeded the expected number of COVID-19 cases, and the implementation of high-level control measures can effectively control the spread of COVID-19 within 2-4 weeks during the early stage of the epidemic.

Here we estimate the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 and propose a dynamical model for the time course of infection number. With this model, we assessed the effects of different measures for infection risk control. The model is different from the previous ones as it models the population as heterogeneous, with subpopulations having different infection risks. Our analyses showed that after this heterogeneity is incorporated in the model, several characteristics of the epidemic are estimated more accurately: the total number of cases and peak number of cases are lower compared to the homogeneous case, the early-stage growth rate in the number of infection cases is little affected, and the decrease in the number of infections slows down during the epidemic late stage. The comparison of our model results with the available data for COVID-19 indicates that the anti-epidemic measures undertaken in China and the rest of the world managed to decrease the basic reproductive number but did not assure an accumulation of sufficient collective immunity. Thus, the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart, which necessitates a careful approach to lifting the quarantine measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrey Gerasimov","author_inst":"I.M.

Effects of lockdown time and rate on the progression of an epidemic incidence curve in a virtual population of 10 thousand subjects. Predictor variables were reproductive values established in the most recent literature (R0 =2.7 and 5.7, and Re = 1.28 from Rio de Janeiro State at May 6th), without lockdown and with coverages of 25%, 50%, and 90% for 21, 35, 70, and 140 days in up to 13 different scenarios for each R0\/Re, where individuals remained infected and transmitters for 14 days. We estimated model validity in theoretical and real scenarios respectively by applying an exponential model on the incidence curve with no lockdown with growth rate coefficient observed in realistic scenarios, and (2) fitting real data series from RJ upon simulated data, respectively. For R0=5.7, the flattening of the curve occurs only with long lockdown periods (70 and 140 days) with a 90% coverage. For R0=2.7, coverages of 25 and 50% also result in curve flattening and reduction of total cases, provided they occur for a long period (70 days or more). For realistic scenario in Rio de Janeiro, lockdowns +25% or more from May 6th during 140 days showed expressive flattening and number of COVID cases two to five times lower. If a more intense coverage lockdown (about +25 to +50% as much as the current one) will be implemented until June 6th during at least 70 days, it is still possible reduce nearly 40-50% the impact of pandemy in state of Rio de Janeiro. These data corroborate the importance of lockdown duration regardless of virus transmission and sometimes of intensity of coverage, either in realistic or theoretical scenarios of COVID-10 epidemics. Even later, the improvement of lockdown coverage can be effective to minimize the impact of epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dimitri M Abramov","author_inst":"National Institute of Women, Children and Adolescents, Health Fernandes Figueira, FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"Saint Clair Gomes Junior Jr.","author_inst":"Unit of Clinical Research, National Institute of Women, Children and Adolescents, Health Fernandes Figueira, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Ministry of Heal"},{"author_name":"Mikhail Lebedev","author_inst":"I.M.

Two of them (B38 and H4) block the binding between RBD and vial cellular receptor ACE2. Further competition assay indicates that B38 and H4 recognize different epitopes on the RBD, which is ideal for a virus-targeting mAb-pair to avoid immune escape in the future clinical applications. Moreover, therapeutic study on the mouse model validated that these two antibodies can reduce virus titers in the infected mouse lungs. Structure of RBD-B38 complex revealed that most residues on the epitope are overlapped with the RBD-ACE2 binding interface, which explained the blocking efficacy and neutralizing capacity.

Working on behalf of NHS England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary. Data sources Primary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, using the new OpenSAFELY platform. Population 17,425,445 adults. Time period 1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020. Primary outcome Death in hospital among people with confirmed COVID-19. Methods Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. Results There were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-1.82). Conclusions We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk. Our OpenSAFELY platform is rapidly adding further NHS patients' records; we will update and extend these results regularly.

However, the availability of validated nomograms and the machine-learning model to predict severity risk and triage of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE To develop and validate nomograms and machine-learning models for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort of 299 consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients at The Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from December 23, 2019, to February 13, 2020, was used to train and validate the models. Six cohorts with 426 patients from eight centers in China, Italy, and Belgium, from February 20, 2020, to March 21, 2020, were used to prospectively validate the models. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalization. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS Of the 299 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50 years ((interquartile range, 35.5-63.0; range, 20-94 years) and 137 (45.8%) were men. Of the 426 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the prospective cohorts, the median age was 62.0 years ((interquartile range, 50.0-72.0; range, 19-94 years) and 236 (55.4%) were men. The model was prospectively validated on six cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.816 to 0.976, with accuracies ranging from 70.8% to 93.8%, sensitivities ranging from 83.7% to 100%, and specificities ranging from 41.0% to 95.7%. The cut-off values of the low, medium, and high-risk probabilities were 0.072 and 0.244. The developed online calculators can be found at www.predict19risk.ai. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The machine learning models, nomograms, and online calculators might be useful for the prediction of onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission. Further prospective research and clinical feedback are necessary to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this model and to determine whether these models can help optimize medical resources and reduce mortality rates compared with current clinical practices.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guangyao Wu","author_inst":"Maastricht university"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Henry C.

Results: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DR{beta}1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Human Herpes virus 7, (HHV7) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci associated with viral antibody response (P<5.0x10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, as well as CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for human herpesvirus 7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P=5.0x10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P=1.1x10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P=1.1x10-8 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen). We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, such as C4A expression in varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia. Conclusions: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linda Kachuri","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Stephen S Francis","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Maike Morrison","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"George Wendt","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yohan Boss\u00e9","author_inst":"Laval University"},{"author_name":"Taylor B Cavazos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sara R Rashkin","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elad Ziv","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John S Witte","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Etienne de Montmollin","author_inst":"APHP-Hopital Bichat"},{"author_name":"Christine Lacabaratz","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Insitute"},{"author_name":"Rodolphe Thiebaut","author_inst":"Univ Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"APHP-Hopital Bichat"},{"author_name":"Yves Levy","author_inst":"VAccine Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Bin Liu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Wenwu Sun","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Albarello","author_inst":"IRCCS, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Via Portuense"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Schinina","author_inst":"IRCCS, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Via Portuense"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Nicastri","author_inst":"IRCCS, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Via Portuense"},{"author_name":"Mariaelena Occhipinti","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Iva Halilaj","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Xie","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"CHU of Liege"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.081497","rel_title":"A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model for the evaluation of COVID-19 medical countermeasures","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.081497","rel_abs":"Coronaviruses are prone to emergence into new host species most recently evidenced by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2. We used reverse genetics to remodel the S and mACE2 binding interface resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB\/c mice. Importantly, disease was more severe in aged mice, and showed more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in hACE2 transgenic mice. We then demonstrated the utility of this model through vaccine challenge studies in immune competent mice with native expression of mACE2. Lastly, we show that clinical candidate interferon (IFN) lambda-1a can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro, and both prophylactic and therapeutic administration diminished replication in mice. Our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of IFN lambda-1a treatment in human COVID-19 infections.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth H.

These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD\/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX\/P). The GD\/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD\/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX\/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD\/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD\/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD\/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD\/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD\/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth H.

Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]20 {micro}M, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clarisse Salgado-Benvindo","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Thaler","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ali Tas","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Natacha S.

However, the new coronavirus spreads more strongly, as it sheds long before onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms. Rapid development of a protective vaccine against COVID-19 is therefore of paramount importance. Here we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein homologous to SARS binds to ACE2, the viral receptor. Higly repetitive display of RBD on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus resulted in a vaccine candidate (RBD-CuMVTT) that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ACE2 and potently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisha Zha","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxin Zhao","author_inst":"High Magnetic Field Laboratory, CAS, 350 Shushan Hu Road, Hefei, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Mona O Mohsen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Liang Hong","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Zhou","author_inst":"Shandong H&Z lifescience Gmbh, Yantai, China"},{"author_name":"Zehua Li","author_inst":"International Immunology centre, Anhui agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Chuankai Yao","author_inst":"Shandong H&Z lifescience Gmbh, Yantai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongquan Chen","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"},{"author_name":"Xuelan Liu","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China; Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, "},{"author_name":"Xinyue Chang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing key laboratory of monoclonal antibody research and development, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Beijing key laboratory of monoclonal antibody research and development, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Ke Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Risk Analysis, Prediction and Management, Academy of Interdisciplinary and Advanced Studies, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhe"},{"author_name":"Monique Vogel","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Martin F Bachmann","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China; Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, "},{"author_name":"Junfeng Wang","author_inst":"High Magnetic Field Laboratory, CAS, 350 Shushan Hu Road, Hefei, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Lisa E.

We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We find that CpG relative abundance, which we characterize by an adequate force parameter taking into account statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels is, on the overall, low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses. However, the CpG force widely fluctuates along the genome, with particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the Spike protein (S) coding region and high value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside (N) coding regions, whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven, in the N protein coding region, both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG content, leading to a loss in CpG.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.\n\nMethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nThe 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.\n\nResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.\n\nConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections.

In order to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suite of ribosome profiling techniques 3-8, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORF)s and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral translated ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts. Overall, our work reveals the full coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 genome, providing a rich resource, which will form the basis of future functional studies and diagnostic efforts.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yaara Finkel","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Orel Mizrahi","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Aharon Nachshon","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Shira Weingarten-Gabbay","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Department of Organismal and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David Morgenstern","author_inst":"de Botton Institute for Protein Profiling, The Nancy and Stephen Grand Israel National Center for Personalised Medicine, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yfat Yahalom-Ronen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona"},{"author_name":"Hadas Tamir","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona"},{"author_name":"Hagit Achdout","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona"},{"author_name":"Dana Stein","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Ofir Israeli","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Adi Beth-Din","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Israel Institute for Biological Research"},{"author_name":"Sharon Melamed","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona"},{"author_name":"Tomer Isrealy","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona"},{"author_name":"Nir Paran","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona"},{"author_name":"Michal Schwartz","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Noam Stern-Ginossar","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Timothy P.

Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic. Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit shortages.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aniela Wozniak","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Ariel Cerda","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Catalina Ibarra-Henriquez","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Valentina Sebastian","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Grace Armijo","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Liliana Lamig","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Carolina Miranda","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Marcela Lagos","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Sandra Solari","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Guzman","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Teresa Quiroga","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Susan Hitschfeld","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eleodoro Riveras","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Marcela Ferres","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo A Gutierrez","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Patricia Garcia","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Noam Stern-Ginossar","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Timothy P.

There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. We observe similar gene expression changes from a COVID-19 patient ex vivo. In addition, we developed a new computational method termed CONditional DENSity Embedding (CONDENSE) to characterize and compare temporal gene dynamics in response to infection, which revealed genes relating to endothelin, angiogenesis, interferon, and inflammation-causing signaling pathways. In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HBECs and a COVID-19 patient and revealed genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with infection.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neal G Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mia Madel Alfajaro","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Victor Gasque","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Wei","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renata B Filler","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C Huston","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Han Wan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bao Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruth R Montgomery","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephanie C Eisenbarth","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam Williams","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamas L Horvath","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mariaelena Occhipinti","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Iva Halilaj","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Xie","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"CHU of Liege"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090761","rel_title":"Scaling COVID-19 against inequalities: should the policy response consistently match the mortality challenge?","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090761","rel_abs":"Background The mortality impact of COVID-19 has thus far been described in terms of crude death counts. We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially-determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. Methods We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. Results Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths, and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. Conclusion Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to build back better.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerry McCartney","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Alastair Leyland","author_inst":"MRC\/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"David Walsh","author_inst":"Glasgow Centre for Population Health"},{"author_name":"Ruth Dundas","author_inst":"MRC\/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Renata B Filler","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C Huston","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Han Wan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bao Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruth R Montgomery","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephanie C Eisenbarth","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam Williams","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamas L Horvath","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mariaelena Occhipinti","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Iva Halilaj","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Xie","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"CHU of Liege"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090878","rel_title":"The disproportionate rise in COVID-19 cases among Hispanic\/Latinx in disadvantaged communities of Orange County, California: A socioeconomic case-series","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090878","rel_abs":"Background: Recent epidemiological evidence has demonstrated a higher rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among minorities.

Methods: This is a case-series of COVID-19 patients from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) across six-weeks between 3\/12\/2020 and 4\/22\/2020. Note, California's shelter-in-place order began on 3\/19\/2020. Individual-level factors included race-ethnicity status were recorded. Neighborhood-level factors from census tracts included median household income, mean household size, proportion without a college degree, proportion working from home, and proportion without health insurance were also recorded. Results: A total of 210-patients tested were COVID-19 positive, of which 73.3% (154\/210) resided in Orange County. Hispanic\/Latinx patients residing in census tracts below the median income demonstrated exponential growth (rate = 55.9%, R2 = 0.9742) during the study period. In addition, there was a significant difference for both race-ethnic (p < 0.001) and income bracket (p = 0.001) distributions prior to and after California's shelter-in-place. In addition, the percentage of individuals residing in neighborhoods with denser households (p = 0.046), lower levels of college graduation (p < 0.001), health insurance coverage (p = 0.01), and ability to work from home (p < 0.001) significantly increased over the same timeframe. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study examines the race-ethnic disparities in Orange County, CA, and highlights vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19. Our descriptive case series illustrates that we also need to consider socioeconomic factors, which ultimately set the stage for biological and social disparities.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel S Chow","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Soun","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Justin Gavis-Bloom","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Brent Weinberg","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter Chang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Simukayi Mutasa","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Edwin Monuki","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jung In Park","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Xie","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bota","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jie Wu","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mariaelena Occhipinti","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Iva Halilaj","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Xie","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"CHU of Liege"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090746","rel_title":"Urban Air Pollution May Enhance COVID-19 Case-Fatality and Mortality Rates in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090746","rel_abs":"Background: The novel human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 240,000 lives worldwide, causing tremendous public health, social, and economic damages. While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, sociodemographic, socioeconomic status, behavior risk factors, and meteorological factors. Results: 1,027,799 COVID-19 cases and 58,489 deaths were reported in 3,122 US counties from January 22, 2020 to April 29, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 5.8%. Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values<0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM2.5 or O3 and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values>0.05), although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.4 ug\/m3) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate. Discussions and Conclusions: Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Donghai Liang","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Liuhua Shi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Zhao","author_inst":"American Cancer Society"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Liu","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Joel Schwartz","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Song Gao","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Sarnat","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stefanie T Ebelt","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Noah C Scovronick","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Howard Chang","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mariaelena Occhipinti","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Iva Halilaj","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Xie","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"CHU of Liege"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090670","rel_title":"Projection of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US as Individual States Re-open May 4,2020","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090670","rel_abs":"In March and April 2020, control measures enforcing social distancing and restricting individual movement and contact were adopted across the United States in an effort to slow the spread and growth of COVID-19.

We use a metapopulation model applied at county resolution to simulate the spread and growth of COVID-19 incidence in the United States. We calibrate the model against county-level daily case and death data collected from February 21, 2020 to May 2, 2020, and project the outbreak in 3,142 US counties for 6 weeks into the future. Projections for daily reported cases, daily new infections (both reported and unreported), new and cumulative hospital bed demand, ICU bed and ventilator demand, as well as daily mortality, are generated. We observe a rebound in COVID-19 incidence and deaths beginning in late May, approximately 2 to 4 weeks after states begin to reopen. Importantly, the lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient broader testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of the COVID-19 until it is well underway.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Teresa Yamana","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sen Pei","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sasikiran Kandula","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joel Schwartz","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Song Gao","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Sarnat","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stefanie T Ebelt","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Noah C Scovronick","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Howard Chang","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mariaelena Occhipinti","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Iva Halilaj","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Xie","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"CHU of Liege"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092361","rel_title":"Cooperative virus propagation underlies COVID-19 transmission dynamics","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092361","rel_abs":"The global pandemic due to the emergence of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a threat to humanity. There remains an urgent need to understand its transmission characteristics and design effective interventions to mitigate its spread. In this study, we define a non-linear (known in biochemistry models as allosteric or cooperative) relationship between viral shedding, viral dose and COVID-19 infection propagation. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and state-wide transmission in the United States of America (USA). The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions against virus transmission. We found that cooperativity was important to capture country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective containment of COVID-19. Finally, in the USA we find that by the summer of 2021, a difference of about 1.5 million deaths may be observed depending on whether the interventions are to be maintained strictly or lifted in entirety.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziwei Dai","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Jason W Locasale","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sasikiran Kandula","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joel Schwartz","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Song Gao","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Sarnat","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stefanie T Ebelt","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Noah C Scovronick","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Howard Chang","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mariaelena Occhipinti","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Barisione","author_inst":"IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino"},{"author_name":"Iva Halilaj","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Yuanliang Xie","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Xiang Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"CHU of Liege"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088781","rel_title":"Updated estimates of comorbidities associated with risk for COVID-19 complications based on US data","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088781","rel_abs":"We updated previous estimates (wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/26\/8\/20-0679_article) of adults with any underlying condition increasing risk of complications from COVID-19 using recent US hospitalization data instead of mortality data from China.
