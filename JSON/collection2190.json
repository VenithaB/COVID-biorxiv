Methods - Air samples were collected in the room of two COVID-19 patients, one of whom had an active respiratory infection with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. By using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle, material was collected from room air and subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and of virus isolated in cell culture from air sampling and from a NP swab from a newly admitted patient in the room were sequenced. Findings - Viable virus was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the NP swab from the patient with an active infection. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units\/L of air. Interpretation - Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John A Lednicky","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Michael Lauzardo","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Z.

Case mortality rates declined consistently and significantly over the course of the four intervals: 57% among those aged 50-59 years; 62% among those aged 60-69 years; 52% among those aged 70-79 years; and 34% among those aged 80 or more years. These findings were consistent with progressive improvements in the medical care of COVID-19 patients. We further studied case mortality by hospitalization status. The case mortality rate among hospitalized patients aged 60-69 years fell significantly from the first to the third interval. During the fourth interval, an apparent rise in mortality among hospitalized patients in the same age group was mirrored by a significant decline in mortality among those not hospitalized. These findings were consistent with the out-of-hospital treatment of some patients who would have previously been hospitalized.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey E Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael Lauzardo","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Z.

In spite of the presumed time advantage for the implementation of preventive measures to help contain its spread, the pandemic in that region followed growth rates that paralleled, and currently exceed, those observed several weeks before in Europe. Indeed, in early August, 2020, many countries in South and Central America presented among the highest rates in the world of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths per million inhabitants. Here, we have taken an ecological approach to describe the current state of the pandemic in Peru and its dynamics. Our analysis supports a protective effect of altitude from COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Further, we provide circumstantial evidence that internal migration through a specific land route is a significant factor progressively overriding the protection from COVID-19 afforded by high altitude. Finally, we show that protection by altitude is independent of poverty indexes and is inversely correlated with the prevalence in the population of risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. We discuss long-term multisystemic adaptations to hypobaric hypoxia as possible mechanisms that may explain the observed protective effect of high altitude from death from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy M Thomson","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Biology, IBMB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Fresia Casas","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Harold Andre Guerrero","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"R\u00f3mulo Figueroa-Mujica","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Francisco C Villafuerte","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Machicado","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Moiz Usmani","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Sripriya N Shankar","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Karim Mohamed","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Arantza Eiguren-Fernandez","author_inst":"Aerosol Dynamics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Caroline J Stephenson","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Md.

Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: Responses were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic between April 27th and July 13th. Participants: 398 LGBTQ+ respondents forming an analytical sample of 310 in the main models. Methods: We used a combined measure of gender identity or expression and sexual orientation as the main explanatory variable. We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We measured experiences of discrimination with a battery of questions that asked respondents whether they had experienced a set of discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. Experiences of discrimination was considered a mediating factor and examined both as an outcome as well as an explanatory variable. Models were adjusted for a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results: The prevalence of depression and stress were both high, with the majority of the sample exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (69%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). In regression models, the average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.517-2.354) for those who had experienced an instance of homophobic or transphobic harassment, compared to respondents who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (CES-D-10 scores of 10 or more) increased three-fold among those who had experienced harassment based on their gender or sexuality compared to those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95% CI: 1.168-9.052). These marked associations remained after adjustment for a number of socioeconomic and demographic covariates. Cis-female respondents who identify as gay or lesbian had the lowest scores for perceived social or depressive symptoms; conversely transgender and gender diverse individuals had the highest scores. Conclusions: We found high levels of stress and depressive symptoms, particularly among younger and transgender and gender diverse respondents. These associations were partially explained by experiences of discrimination which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on stress and mental health.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dylan Kneale","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laia Becares","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Harold Andre Guerrero","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"R\u00f3mulo Figueroa-Mujica","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Francisco C Villafuerte","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Machicado","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Moiz Usmani","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Sripriya N Shankar","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Karim Mohamed","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Arantza Eiguren-Fernandez","author_inst":"Aerosol Dynamics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Caroline J Stephenson","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Md.

The Spike 614G variant subsequently increased in frequency in many locations throughout the world. Global patterns of dispersal of Spike 614G are suggestive of a selective advantage of this variant, however the origin of Spike 614G is associated with early colonization events in Europe and subsequent radiations to the rest of the world. Increasing frequency of 614G may therefore be due to a random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of Spike 614G at the level of an individual country, the United Kingdom, using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected by COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium. Using phylogenetic analysis, we identify Spike 614G and 614D clades with unique origins in the UK and from these we extrapolate and compare growth rates of co-circulating transmission clusters. We find that Spike 614G clusters are introduced in the UK later on average than 614D clusters and grow to larger size after adjusting for time of introduction. Phylodynamic analysis does not show a significant increase in growth rates for clusters with the 614G variant, but population genetic modelling indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We also investigate the potential influence of Spike 614D versus G on virulence by matching a subset of records to clinical data on patient outcomes. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the Spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality, but younger patients have slightly increased odds of 614G carriage. Despite the availability of a very large data set, well represented by both Spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of higher transmission rate for 614G, but significant differences in growth, size, and composition of these lineages indicate a need for continued study.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Verity Hill","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"John T McCrone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Anna Price","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aine O'Toole","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joel Alexander Southgate","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F.

Without social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 will grow exponentially, but social distancing and people's learning behavior (isolating, staying at home, wearing face masks, washing hands, restricting the size and frequency of group gatherings, etc.) can significantly impede the epidemic spread, flatten the infection curve, and change the final outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results demonstrate that strict social distancing and people's learning behavior can be effective in slowing the spread rate and significantly reducing the total number of infections, daily infection rate, peak of daily infections, and duration of the epidemic. Under strict social distancing, the rise and fall of infections would be nearly symmetric about the peak of of daily infections, and the epidemic spread would be essentially over within 60 days. Relaxing social distancing and people learning behaviors will significantly increase the total and daily numbers of infections and prolong the course of the outbreak. These results have immediate applications for the implementation of various social-distancing policies and general significance for ongoing outbreaks and similar infectious disease epidemics in the future.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baolian Cheng","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ming Wang","author_inst":"Retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"John T McCrone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Anna Price","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aine O'Toole","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joel Alexander Southgate","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F.

This analysis aimed to assess how mothers are feeling and coping during lockdown, and to identify the potential pathways that can assist them. Methods: 1329 women living in the UK aged [&ge;]18 years with an infant [&le;]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey. Descriptive analysis of maternal mental health, coping, support received, activities undertaken and consequences of lockdown was conducted. Linear regression was used to predict maternal mental health and coping, using activities, support, and consequences of the lockdown as predictors, while adjusting for age, gestational age, ethnicity, income, marital status and number of children. Results: More than half of the participants reported feeling down (56%), lonely (59%), irritable (62%) and worried (71%), to some or high extent since lockdown began. Despite this, 70% felt able to cope with the situation. Support with her own health (95% CI .004, .235), contacting infant support groups (95% CI -.003, .252), and higher infant gestational age (95% CI .000, .063) predicted better mental health. Travelling for work (95% CI -.680, -.121), lockdown having a major impact on the ability to afford food (95% CI -1.202, -.177), and having an income lower than 30k (95% CI -.475, -.042) predicted poorer mental health. Support with her own health and more equal division of household chores were associated with better coping. Conclusion: During lockdown, a large proportion of new mothers experienced symptoms of poor mental health; mothers of infants with lower gestational age, with low income, and who are travelling to work were particularly at risk. However, greater support for maternal health and with household chores showed positive associations with maternal mental health and coping. These findings highlight the urgent need to assess maternal mental health, and to identify prevention strategies for mothers during different stages of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Dib","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Emeline Rougeaux","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Adriana V\u00e1zquez-V\u00e1zquez","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Jonathan CK Wells","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Mary Fewtrell","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Aine O'Toole","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joel Alexander Southgate","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F.

Developing tools to measure seroprevalence and understand protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a priority. We aimed to develop a serological assay using plant-derived recombinant viral proteins, which represent important tools in less-resourced settings. Methods: We established an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) portions of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. We measured antibody responses in sera from South African patients (n=77) who had tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were taken a median of six weeks after the diagnosis, and the majority of participants had mild and moderate COVID-19 disease. In addition, we tested the reactivity of pre-pandemic plasma (n=58) and compared the performance of our in-house ELISA with a commercial assay. We also determined whether our assay could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA in saliva. Results: We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins are readily detectable using recombinant plant-derived viral proteins, in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Reactivity to S1 and RBD was detected in 51 (66%) and 48 (62%) of participants, respectively. Notably, we detected 100% of samples identified as having S1-specific antibodies by a validated, high sensitivity commercial ELISA, and OD values were strongly and significantly correlated between the two assays. For the pre-pandemic plasma, 1\/58 (1.7%) of samples were positive, indicating a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in our ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG correlated significantly with IgA and IgM responses. Endpoint titers of S1- and RBD-specific immunoglobulins ranged from 1:50 to 1:3200. S1-specific IgG and IgA were found in saliva samples from convalescent volunteers. Conclusions: We demonstrate that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in plants enable robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses. This assay can be used for seroepidemiological studies and to measure the strength and durability of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients in our setting.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohau S Makatsa","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marius B Tincho","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Jerome M Wendoh","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Sherazaan D Ismail","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Rofhiwa Nesamari","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Francisco Pera","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Scott de Beer","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Anura David","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Sarika Jugwanth","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Methods We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database for Covid-19 using the terms viral culture or viral replication and associated synonyms up to 10 September 2020. We carried out citation matching and included studies reporting attempts to culture or observe SARS-CoV-2 matching with cutoffs for RT-PCR positivity. One reviewer extracted data for each study and a second reviewer checked end edited the extraction and summarised the narratively by sample: fecal, respiratory, environment, blood or mixed. Where necessary we wrote to corresponding authors of the included or background papers for additional information. We assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. This is the fourth version of this review that was first published on the 4th of August and updated on the 21t of August, on the 3rd and 10th of September. Results We included 29 studies reporting culturing or observing tissue invasion by SARS-CoV in sputum, naso or oropharyngeal, urine, stool, blood and environmental samples from patients diagnosed with Covid-19. The data are suggestive of a relation between the time from collection of a specimen to test, cycle threshold and symptom severity. The quality of the studies was moderate with lack of standardised reporting. Twelve studies reported that Ct values were significantly lower and log copies higher in samples producing live virus culture. Five studies reported no growth in samples based on a Ct cut-off value. These values ranged from CT > 24 for no growth to Ct > 34 or more. Two studies report a strong relationship between Ct value and ability to recover infectious virus and that the odds of live virus culture reduced by 33% for every one unit increase in Ct. A cut-off RT-PCR Ct > 30 was associated with non-infectious samples. One study that analysed the NSP, N and E gene fragments of the PCR result reported different cut-off thresholds depending on the gene fragment analysed. The duration of RNA shedding detected by PCR was far longer compared to detection of live culture. Six out of eight studies reported RNA shedding for longer than 14 days. Yet, infectivity declines after day 8 even among cases with ongoing high viral loads. A very small proportion of people re-testing positive after hospital discharge or with high Ct are likely to be infectious. Conclusion Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patient factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. A binary Yes \/ No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Jefferson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Spencer","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jon Brassey","author_inst":"Trip Database Ltd"},{"author_name":"Carl Heneghan","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rofhiwa Nesamari","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Francisco Pera","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Scott de Beer","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Anura David","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Sarika Jugwanth","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Researches are ongoing to find an efficient treatment strategy for this disease by either inactivating the virus or boosting the immune system of patient or by managing the cytokine storm. Aim: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of Substance P receptor Neurokinin 1 antagonist in Covid 19 patients against the usual treatments as controls. Patients and Methods: It is a randomized clinical trial, open label, having two arms, one receiving normal management and care while other receiving Neurokinin 1 Receptor antagonist, Aprepitant, in addition. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid is also administered orally to both the groups. PCR positive, hospitalized patients with more than 18 years of age, both genders, moderate to critical phase were included. 18 patients were randomly allocated in both arms, having 10 in group A and 8 in group B. Lab investigations were performed in both the groups before and after the intervention. We report preliminary results for the comparison of Aprepitant 80 mg given once daily for 3 to 5 days vs routine management. The primary outcome was total in hospital days and duration of disease. Results: Mean age of patients in group A was 47.63 +12.07years while 60.90+ 9.75 years in group B. There were 3 males in group A and 8 in group B. There were 2 critical patients in group A and 5 in group B. Biochemical and hematological parameters in both groups didnot show much difference except the C reactive protein reduction in the intervention group, indicative of a reduced inflammation. Oxygen saturation also improved but more patients should be enrolled to get a statistically significant data. One patient was discharged from each group within 5 days and one patient expired in each. Conclusions: It is a pilot study but the findings give a strong clue for the therapeutic potential of Aprepitant. Patients who received a combination therapy of Aprepitant and Dexamethasone were recovered earlier and showed improved clinical outcomes, laboratory findings and reduced C reactive protein which is an inflammatory marker. We suggest here a study on larger sample size to get a deeper insight of its potential and efficacy. It may be more effective in severe to critical patients having respiratory difficulties.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Riffat Mehboob","author_inst":"University of Lahore"},{"author_name":"Fridoon Ahmad","author_inst":"University of health sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ahad Qayyum","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Asim Rana","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Syed Amir Gilani","author_inst":"University of Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Akram Tariq","author_inst":"Higher education department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Javed Akram","author_inst":"University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Anura David","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Sarika Jugwanth","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

The disease can be spread by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, and remains uncertainty over key aspects of its infectivity, no effective remedy yet exists and this disease causes severe economic effects globally. For these reasons, COVID-19 is the subject of intense and widespread discussion on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. These public forums substantially impact on public opinions in some cases and exacerbate widespread panic and misinformation spread during the crisis. Thus, this work aimed to design an intelligent clustering-based classification and topics extracting model (named TClustVID) that analyze COVID-19-related public tweets to extract significant sentiments with high accuracy. We gathered COVID-19 Twitter datasets from the IEEE Dataport repository and employed a range of data preprocessing methods to clean the raw data, then applied tokenization and produced a word-to-index dictionary. Thereafter, different classifications were employed to Twitter datasets which enabled exploration of the performance of traditional and TClustVID classification methods. TClustVID showed higher performance compared to the traditional classifiers determined by clustering criteria. Finally, we extracted significant topic clusters from TClustVID, split them into positive, neutral and negative clusters and implemented latent dirichlet allocation for extraction of popular COVID-19 topics. This approach identified common prevailing public opinions and concerns related to COVID-19, as well as attitudes to infection prevention strategies held by people from different countries concerning the current pandemic situation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

We sought to determine the change in rates and types of admissions to tertiary and specialty care hospitals in the COVID-19 era compared with pre-COVID-19 era. Methods Acute care admissions to the largest tertiary care referral hospital, designated national referral centers for cardiac, cancer and maternity hospital in the State of Qatar during March 2020 (COVID-19 era) and January 2020 and March 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) were compared. We calculated total admissions, and admissions for eight specific acute care conditions, in-hospital mortality rate and length of stay at each hospital. Results A total of 18,889 hospital admissions were recorded. A sharp decline ranging from 9%-75% was observed in overall admissions. A decline in both elective and non-elective surgeries was observed. A decline of 9%-58% was observed in admissions for acute appendicitis, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, bone fractures, cancer and live births, while an increase in admissions due to respiratory tract infections was observed. Overall length of stay was shorter in the COVID-19 period possibly suggesting lesser overall disease severity, with no significant change in in-hospital mortality. Unadjusted mortality rate for Qatar showed marginal increase in the COVID-19 period. Conclusions We observed a sharp decline in acute care hospital admissions, with a significant decline in admissions due to seven out of eight acute care conditions. This decline was associated with a shorter length of stay, but not associated with a change in in-hospital mortality rate.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anand B Kartha","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer A Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Aftab M Azad","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nidal A Asaad","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mohamad U Alhomsi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Huda A Saleh","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bertollini","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdul-Badi Abou-Samra","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Fitting mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provides a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the basic reproductive ratio, R, has taken on special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control (R<1). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks. Here, focusing on the dynamics of the first-wave (March-June 2020), we present in some detail the inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing. We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the timecourse of the outbreak. To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Louise Dyson","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Glen Guyver-Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Alex Holmes","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Michael J Tildesley","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edward M Hill","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Claude Houdayer","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Rouen University Hospital and Inserm U1245, UNIROUEN, Normandie Univ, Normandy Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, France"},{"author_name":"Manuel Etienne","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Caron","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Plantier","author_inst":"Virology Laboratory, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France"},{"author_name":"Thierry Frebourg","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Rouen University Hospital and Inserm U1245, UNIROUEN, Normandie Univ, Normandy Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, France"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

To resolve these issues, we developed SalivaDirect, which received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on August 15th, 2020. The critical component of our approach is to use saliva instead of respiratory swabs, which enables non-invasive frequent sampling and reduces the need for trained healthcare professionals during collection. Furthermore, we simplified our diagnostic test by (1) not requiring nucleic acid preservatives at sample collection, (2) replacing nucleic acid extraction with a simple proteinase K and heat treatment step, and (3) testing specimens with a dualplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. We validated SalivaDirect with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors to minimize the risk for supply chain issues. Regardless of our tested combination of reagents and instruments from different vendors, we found that SalivaDirect is highly sensitive with a limit of detection of 6-12 SARS-CoV-2 copies\/L. When comparing SalivaDirect to paired nasopharyngeal swabs using the authorized ThermoFisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit, we found high agreement in testing outcomes (>94%). In partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Players Association, we conducted a large-scale (n = 3,779) SalivaDirect usability study and comparison to standard nasal\/oral tests for asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection. From this cohort of healthy NBA players, staff, and contractors, we found that 99.7% of samples were valid using our saliva collection techniques and a 89.5% positive and >99.9% negative test agreement to swabs, demonstrating that saliva is a valid and noninvasive alternative to swabs for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing. SalivaDirect is a flexible and inexpensive ($1.21-$4.39\/sample in reagent costs) option to help improve SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity.

Comorbidities have been reported to be risk factors for the complications of COVID-19. In this work, we develop and analyze a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in order to assess the impacts of prior comorbidity on COVID-19 complications and COVID-19 re-infection. The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of re-infection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Sensitivity analysis of the model when the population of individuals co-infected with COVID-19 and comorbidity is used as response function revealed that the top ranked parameters that drive the dynamics of the co-infection model are the effective contact rate for COVID-19 transmission, {beta}cv, the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 by comorbid susceptibles, {chi}cm, the comorbidity development rate, {theta}cm, the detection rate for singly infected and co-infected individuals, {eta}1 and {eta}2, as well as the recovery rate from COVID-19 for co-infected individuals, {phi}i2. Simulations of the model reveal that the cumulative confirmed cases (without comorbidity) may get up to 180,000 after 200 days, if the hyper susceptibility rate of comorbid susceptibles is as high as 1.2 per day. Also, the cumulative confirmed cases (including those co-infected with comorbidity) may be as high as 1000,000 cases by the end of November, 2020 if the re-infection rates for COVID-19 is 0.1 per day. It may be worse than this if the re-infection rates increase higher. Moreover, if policies are strictly put in place to step down the probability of COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles to as low as 0.4 per day and step up the detection rate for singly infected individuals to 0.7 per day, then the reproduction number can be brought very low below one, and COVID-19 infection eliminated from the population. In addition, optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the the strategy that prevents COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles has the least ICER and is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Omame","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology Owerri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ndolane Sene","author_inst":"University Cheikh Anta Diop"},{"author_name":"Ikenna Nometa","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Manoa"},{"author_name":"Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma","author_inst":"Kumoh National Institute of Technology Gumi, Korea"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Ugochukwu Nwafor","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology Owerri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Nneka Onyinyechi Iheonu","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology Owerri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Daniel Okuonghae","author_inst":"University of Benin, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Chaney C Kalinich","author_inst":"Yale School of Public health"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ott","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Joseph R.

Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated disease and transmission dynamics in domestic cats. Six 4- to 5-month-old cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes simultaneously. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel contact cats were co-mingled with the principal infected animals. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding throughout the 21 DPC observation period. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC to investigate disease progression. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. Serology showed that both, principal and sentinel cats, developed SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detectable at 7 DPC or 10 DPC, respectively. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels within 2 days of comingling.

Different features associated with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, such as hyperinflammation and reduction of peripheral CD8+ T cell counts are strongly associated with severe disease. Here, we confirm the reduction in peripheral CD8+ T cells both in relative and absolute terms and identify T cell apoptosis and migration into inflamed tissues as possible mechanisms driving peripheral T cell lymphopenia. Furthermore, we find evidence of elevated serum interleukin-7, thus indicating systemic T cell paucity and signs of increased T cell proliferation in patients with severe lymphopenia. Following T cell lymphopenia in our pseudo-longitudinal time course, we observed expansion and recovery of poly-specific antiviral T cells, thus arguing for lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation. In summary, this study suggests that extensive T cell loss and subsequent T cell proliferation are characteristic of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Adamo","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Chevrier","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Carlo Cervia","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Yves Zurbuchen","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Miro E.

Excessive inflammation has been postulated to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and innate immune mechanisms are likely to be central in the inflammatory response. We used 40-plex mass cytometry and targeted serum proteomics to profile innate immune cell populations from peripheral blood of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and healthy controls. Sampling at different stages of COVID-19 allowed us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate immune response. Despite the expected patient heterogeneity, we identified consistent changes during the course of the infection. A rapid and early surge of CD169+ monocytes associated with an IFN{gamma}+MCP-2+ signature quickly followed symptom onset; at symptom onset, patients with mild and severe COVID-19 had a similar signature, but over the course of the disease, the differences between patients with mild and severe disease increased. Later in the disease course, we observed a more pronounced re-appearance of intermediate\/non-classical monocytes and mounting systemic CCL3 and CCL4 levels in patients with severe disease. Our data provide new insights into the dynamic nature of the early inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and identifies sustained pathological innate immune responses as a likely key mechanism in severe COVID-19, further supporting investigation of targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Chevrier","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Yves Zurbuchen","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Carlo Cervia","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Adamo","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Miro E Raeber","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Natalie de Souza","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sujana Sivapatham","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andrea Jacobs","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Esther B\u00e4chli","author_inst":"Clinic for Internal Medicine, Uster Hospital, Uster, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alain Rudiger","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Limmattal Hospital, Schlieren, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Melina St\u00fcssi-Helbling","author_inst":"Clinic for Internal Medicine, City Hospital Triemli Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lars C Huber","author_inst":"Clinic for Internal Medicine, City Hospital Triemli Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dominik J Schaer","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, USZ, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jakob Nilsson","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Onur Boyman","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bernd Bodenmiller","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Udeni BR Balasuriya","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Juergen A Richt","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Santos Bermejo","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa Campbell","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Allison Nelson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Yale IMPACT Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harlan M.

The technical design of our SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine provides a viral antigen that enables the exposure of more than one structural protein based upon the antibody composition of COVID-19 patients convalescent serum. This design led to valid immunity with increasing neutralizing antibody titers and a CTL response detected post-immunization of this vaccine by two injections in rhesus macaques. Further, this elicited immunoprotection in macaques enables not only to restrain completely viral replication in tissues of immunized animals, compared to the adjuvant control and those immunized by an RBD peptide vaccine, but also to significantly alleviate inflammatory lesion in lung tissues in histo-pathologic detection, compared to the adjuvant control with developed interstitial pneumonia. The data obtained from these macaques immunized with the inactivated vaccine or RBD peptide vaccine suggest that immunity with a clinically protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection should

pathogenesis in SARS-CoV2 is the ORF3a protein which is the largest accessory protein among others accessory proteins coded by coronavirus genome. The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 is continuously evolving naturally and thereby the encoded proteins are also mutating rapidly. Therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainty important from the pathogenetic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 various non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV2 are identified and their corresponding effects in structural stability and functions of the protein ORF3a are studied. Broadly three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease and mixed (neutral and disease) type mutations were observed. Consecutive mutations in some ORF3a proteins are established based on timeline of detection of mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions over the ORF3a primary protein sequences, twenty clusters are detected based on K-means clustering method. Our findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge of ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV2, which would assist to enlighten on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sk.

a fast-moving epidemic, timely monitoring of case counts and other key indicators of disease spread is critical to an effective public policy response. We describe a nonparametric statistical method - originally applied to the reporting of AIDS cases in the 1980s - to estimate the distribution of reporting delays of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City. During June 21 - August 1, 2020, the estimated mean delay in reporting was 5 days, with 15 percent of cases reported after 10 or more days. Relying upon the estimated reporting-delay distribution, we project COVID-19 incidence during the most recent three weeks as if each case had instead been reported on the same day that the underlying diagnostic test had been performed. The statistical method described here overcomes the problem of reporting delays only at the population level. The method does not eliminate reporting delays at the individual level. That will require improvements in diagnostic technology, test availability, and specimen processing.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey E Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Diksha Attrish","author_inst":"Dr. B.

available rapid immunological tests for identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies and their subsequent application to a regional screening of health care workers (HCW) in Tuscany (Italy). Design: measures of accuracy and HCW serological surveillance Setting: 6 major health facilities in Tuscany, Italy. Participants: 17,098 HCW of the Tuscany Region. Measures of accuracy were estimated to assess sensitivity in 176 hospitalized Covid-19 clinical subjects at least 14 days after a diagnostic PCR-positive assay result. Specificity was assessed in 295 sera biobanked in the pre-Covid-19 era in winter or summer 2013-14 Main outcome measures: Sensitivity and specificity, and 95% confidence intervals, were measured using two serological tests, named T-1 and T-2. Positive and Negative predictive values were estimated at different levels of prevalence. HCW of the health centers were tested using the serological tests, with a follow- up nasopharyngeal PCR-test swab in positive tested cases. Results: Sensitivity was estimated as 99% (95%CI: 95%-100%) and 97% (95% CI: 90%-100%), whereas specificity was the 95% and 92%, for Test T-1 and T-2 respectively. In the historical samples IgM cross-reactions were detected in sera collected during the winter period, probably linked to other human coronaviruses. Out of the 17,098 tested, 3.1% have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, among them 6.8% were positive at PCR follow-up test on nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusion Based on the low prevalence estimate observed in this survey, the use of serological test as a stand-alone test is not justified to assess the individual immunity status. Serological tests showed good performance and might be useful in an integrated surveillance, for identification of infected subjects and their contacts as required by the policy of contact tracing, with the aim to reduce the risk of dissemination, especially in health service facilities.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Maria Carozzi","author_inst":"Regional Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, Institute for prevention, research and oncological network (ISPRO)"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Cusi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena"},{"author_name":"Mauro Pistello","author_inst":"Virology Unit, Pisa University Hospital, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luisa Galli","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy  and Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Meyer Children's University, Hospital, Florence,"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bartoloni","author_inst":"Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy  and Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Anichini","author_inst":"Department of Translational Research, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Azzari","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy and Pediatric Immunology Unit, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Emdin","author_inst":"Fondazione Toscana G.

A safe and effective vaccine that can provide herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to stop the spread of this virus among humans. Many human viral vaccines are live attenuated forms of viruses that elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the development of a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine (SARS-CoV-2\/human\/Korea\/CNUHV03-CA22{degrees}C\/2020) by gradually adapting the growth of SARS-CoV-2 from 37{degrees}C to 22{degrees}C in Vero cells. This vaccine can be potentially administered to humans through nasal spray. Its single dose was observed to strongly induce the neutralising antibody (>640), cellular immunity, and mucosal IgA antibody in intranasally immunised K18-hACE2 mice, which are very susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. The one-dose vaccinated mice were completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not show loss of body weight, death, and the presence of virus in tissues, such as the nasal turbinates, brain, lungs, and kidneys.
