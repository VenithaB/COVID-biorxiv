Clinicians need a more accurate understanding of the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19. Methods: We searched studies reporting clinical characteristics in children with COVID-19 published until March 31, 2020. We screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the risk of bias and quality of evidence of the included studies. We combined some of the outcomes (symptoms) in a single-arm meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results: Our search retrieved 49 studies, including 25 case reports, 23 case series and one cohort study, with a total of 1667 patients. Our meta-analysis showed that most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms. Eighty-three percent of the children were within family clusters of cases, and 19% had no symptoms. At least 7% with digestive symptoms. The main symptoms of children were fever (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 39%, 56%) and cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%, 48%). The lymphocyte count was below normal level in only 15% [95% CI: 8%, 22%] of children which is different from adult patients. 66% [95% CI: 55%, 77%] of children had abnormal findings in CT imaging. Conclusions: Most children with COVID-19 have only mild symptoms, and many children are asymptomatic. Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in children. Vomiting and diarrhea were not common in children. The lymphocyte count is usually within the normal range in children.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Chenglin Wang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Qianling Shi","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, China"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Yangqin Xun","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20064436","rel_title":"Potential Effectiveness and Safety of Antiviral Agents in Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20064436","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak presents a new, life-threatening disease. Our aim was to assess the potential effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for COVID-19 in children. Methods: Electronic databases from their inception to March, 31 2020 were searched for randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies of interventions with antiviral agents for children (less than 18 years of age) with COVID-19. Results: A total of 23 studies of indirect evidence with 6008 patients were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate to high in general. The effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 is uncertain: For adults with COVID-19, lopinavir\/ritonavir had no effect on mortality (risk ratio [RR]= 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 1.30) and probability of negative PCR test (RR=0.98, 95 CI% 0.82 to 1.18). Arbidol had no benefit on probability of negative PCR test (RR=1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.73). Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with increasing the probability of negative PCR result (RR=0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18). For adults with SARS, interferon was associated with reduced corticosteroid dose (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-0.14 g, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.07) but had no effect on mortality (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.88); ribavirin did not reduce mortality (RR=0.68, 95% CI % 0.43 to 1.06) and was associated with high risk of severe adverse reactions; and oseltamivir had no effect on mortality (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.38). Ribavirin combined with interferon was also not effective in adults with MERS and associated with adverse reactions. Conclusions: There is no evidence showing the effectiveness of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19, and the clinical efficacy of existing antiviral agents is still uncertain. We do not suggest clinical routine use of antivirals for COVID-19 in children, with the exception of clinical trials.

Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions. METHODS We estimated growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowd sourced time series data. Further, we also estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and time dependent reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models. RESULTS On an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14, SD 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% likely to be infected at peak time of incidence. CONCLUSIONS The pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase fund for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a medicine.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aravind Lathika Rajendrakumar","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Anand Thakarakkattil Narayanan Nair","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Charvi Nangia","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Prabal Kumar Chourasia","author_inst":"Mary Washington Hospital, Fredericksburg WV, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehul Kumar Chourasia","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ghouse Syed","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Anu Sasidharan Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Arun B Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative"},{"author_name":"Muhammed Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Boston University, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Che","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Qubei Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065524","rel_title":"Investigating spatial variability in COVID-19 pandemic severity across 19 geographic areas, Spain, 2020","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065524","rel_abs":"Introduction: Spain has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, ranking fifth in the world in terms of both total cases and total deaths due to COVID-19 as of May 20, 2020. Here we derived estimates of pandemic severity and assessed its relationship with socio-demographic and healthcare factors. Methods: We retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Spain from February 20, 2020 to May 20, 2020. We used statistical methods to estimate the time-delay adjusted case fatality risk (aCFR) for 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities of Spain. We then assessed how transmission and sociodemographic variables were associated with the aCFR across areas using multivariate regression analysis. Results: We estimated the highest aCFR for Madrid (25.9%) and the average aCFR in Spain (18.2%). Our multivariate regression analysis revealed three statistically significant predictor variables: population size, population density, and the unemployment rate. Conclusions: The estimated aCFR for 10 autonomous communities\/cities in Spain are significantly higher than those previously estimated for other geographic regions including China and Korea. Our results suggest that public health interventions focused on densely populated areas and low socioeconomic groups can ameliorate the mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sushma Dahal","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mehul Kumar Chourasia","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ghouse Syed","author_inst":"University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Anu Sasidharan Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Arun B Nair","author_inst":"Health System Research India Initiative"},{"author_name":"Muhammed Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Boston University, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Che","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Qubei Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065664","rel_title":"Application of Telemedicine During the Coronavirus Disease Epidemics: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065664","rel_abs":"Background: As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, early prevention and control of the epidemic is extremely important. Telemedicine, which includes medical advice given over telephone, Internet, mobile phone applications or other similar ways, may be an efficient way to reduce transmission and pressure on medical institutions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for literature on the use of telemedicine for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We included studies about the content of the consultation (such as symptoms, therapy and prevention, policy, public service), screening of suspected cases, the provision of advice given to those people who may have symptoms or contact history. We conducted meta-analyses on the main outcomes of the studies. Results: A total of 2041 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After reading the full texts, we finally included nine studies. People were most concerned about symptoms (64.2%), epidemic situation and public problems (14.5%), and psychological problems (10.3%) during COVID-19 epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, the proportions of people asking for consultation for symptoms, prevention and therapy, and psychological problems were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. Two studies demonstrated that telemedicine can be used to screen the suspected patients and give advice. One study emphasized the limited possibilities to follow up people calling hotlines and difficulties in identifying all suspect cases. Conclusions: Telemedicine services should focus on the issues that the public is most concerned about, such as then symptoms, prevention and treatment of the disease, and provide reasonable advice to patients with symptoms or people with epidemic history.

As of April 10, 2020 half COVID-19 deaths in Canada had occurred in LTC. We sought to better understand trends and risk factors for COVID-19 death in LTC in Ontario. Methods: We analyzed a COVID-19 outbreak database created by the Ontario Ministry of Health, for the period March 29-April 7, 2020. Mortality incidence rate ratios for LTC were calculated with community living Ontarians aged > 69 used as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and identify associations between infection risk in staff and residents, and subsequent LTC resident death. Results: Confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 were identified in 272\/627 LTC by April 7, 2020. The incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 death was 13.1 (9.9-17.3) relative to community living adults over 69. Incidence rate ratio increased over time and was 87.28 (90% CrI 9.98 to 557.08) by April 7, 2020. Lagged infection in staff was a strong predictor of death in residents (e.g., adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.26 at a 6-day lag). Interpretation: Mortality risk in elders in Ontario is currently concentrated in LTC, and this risk has increased sharply over a short period of time. Early identification of risk requires a focus on testing and provision of personal protective equipment to staff, and restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent movement of COVID-19 between LTC.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Lauren Lapointe-Shaw","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Janine McCready","author_inst":"Michael Garron Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Qianling Shi","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shuya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science a"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center,School of Basic Medical Sciences,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University,Chongqing 400014,China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Shu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Daiyin Tian","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065771","rel_title":"A systematic review of antibody mediated immunity to coronaviruses: antibody kinetics, correlates of protection, and association of antibody responses with severity of disease","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065771","rel_abs":"The duration and nature of immunity generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angkana T.

However, with regard to the effects of inflammatory markers on the severity of COVID-19, studies have reported associations that vary in strength and direction. Aims: In the meta-analysis, we aimed to provide an overview of the association of inflammatory markers with severity of COVID-19. Methods: The following databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang database and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) database until March 20, 2020. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models. Results: A total of 16 studies were included in our analysis comprising of 3962 patients with COVID-19. Random-effects results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in non-severe group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = -41.78 mg\/l, 95% CI = [-52.43, -31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = -0.13 ng\/ml, 95% CI = [-0.20, -0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = -21.32 ng\/l, 95% CI = [-28.34, -14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = -8.40 mm\/h, 95% CI = [-14.32, -2.48], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = -43.35 g\/ml, 95% CI = [-80.85, -5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = -398.80 mg\/l, 95% CI = [-625.89, -171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in severe group. Moreover, survivors had lower level for IL-6 than non-survivors with COVID-19 (WMD = -4.80 ng\/ml, 95% CI = [-5.87, -3.73], P < 0.001). These results were consistent through sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment.

The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state. We have made the codes of our proposed framework publicly available to the research and healthcare community.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shahin Khobahi","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Chirag Agarwal","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mojtaba Soltanalian","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Guangtong Deng","author_inst":"Xiangya hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Susan M Rattigan","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Brooke Borgert","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Carlos Moreno","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Benjamin D.

As patients potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 need to visit hospitals, the incidence of nosocomial infection can be expected to be high. Therefore, a comprehensive and objective understanding of nosocomial infection is needed to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. Methods: We searched major international and Chinese databases Medicine, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM(China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang database)) for case series or case reports on nosocomial infections of COVID-19, SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) and MERS(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis of the proportion of nosocomial infection patients in the diagnosed patients, occupational distribution of nosocomial infection medical staff and other indicators. Results: We included 40 studies. Among the confirmed patients, the proportions of nosocomial infections were 44.0%, 36.0% and 56.0% for COVID-19, SARS and MERS, respectively. Of the confirmed patients, the medical staff and other hospital-acquired infections accounted for 33.0% and 2.0% of COVID-19 cases, 37.0% and 24.0% of SARS cases, and 19.0% and 36.0% of MERS cases, respectively. Nurses and doctors were the most affected among the infected medical staff. The mean numbers of secondary cases caused by one index patient were 29.3 and 6.3 for SARS and MERS, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of nosocomial infection in patients with COVID-19 was 44%. Patients attending hospitals should take personal protection. Medical staff should be awareness of the disease to protect themselves and the patients.

In the current paper we address this question using a simple estimation-prediction method. The input is the observed initial doubling time and a known value of R0. The simple General epidemic model is then fitted, and time calibration to calendar time is done using the observed number of case fatalities, together with estimates of the time between infection to death and the infection fatality risk. Finally, predictions are made assuming no change of behaviour, as well as for the situation where preventive measures are put in place at one specific time-point. The overall effect of the preventive measures is assumed to be known, or else estimated from the observed increased doubling time after preventive measures are put in place. The predictions are highly sensitive to the doubling times without and with preventive measures, sensitive to R0, but less sensitive to the estimates used for time-calibration: observed number of case fatalities, typical time between infection and death, and the infection fatality risk. The method is applied to the urban area of Stockholm, and predictions show that the peak of infections appear in mid-April and infections start settling in May.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Britton","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Juan P Torres","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Miguel ORyan","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Olivares","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Pablo Gallardo","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile"},{"author_name":"Carolina Salas","author_inst":"Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna"},{"author_name":"Xianzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science a"},{"author_name":"Zijun Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qianling Shi","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20067348","rel_title":"Massive and rapid COVID-19 testing is feasible by extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20067348","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The most widely used method of COVID-19 diagnostics is a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient samples, typically from nasopharyngeal swabs. RNA extraction is a major bottleneck in current COVID-19 testing, in terms of turn-around, logistics, component availability and cost, which delays or completely precludes COVID-19 diagnostics in many settings. Efforts to simplify the current methods are critical, as increased diagnostic availability and efficiency would benefit patient care and infection control. Here, we describe methods to circumvent RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-PCR directly on heat-inactivated subject samples as well as samples lysed with readily available detergents. Our data, including benchmarking with 597 clinically diagnosed patient samples against a standardised and sensitive diagnostic system, show that direct RT-PCR is a viable option to extraction-based COVID-19 diagnostics. Furthermore, using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated performance of generic buffers as sample medium for the direct RT-PCR assay, identifying several suitable formulations. We also confirmed the effectiveness of heat inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by plaque assay. Significant savings in terms of time and cost can be achieved by embracing RNA-extraction-free protocols, that feed directly into the established PCR-based testing pipeline. This could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioanna Smyrlaki","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Ekman","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Lentini","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Nuno Rufino de Sousa","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Natali Papanicoloau","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064501","rel_title":"What influences COVID-19 infection rates: A statistical approach to identify promising factors applied to infection data from Germany","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064501","rel_abs":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic is of big and world-wide concern. There is an intense discussion and uncertainty which factors and sanctions can reduce infection rates. The overall aim is to prevent an overload of the medical system. Even within one country, there is frequently a strong local variability in both -- political sanctions as well as other local factors -- which may influence infection rates. The main focus of study is analysis and interpretation of recent temporal developments (infection rates). We present a statistical framework designed to identify local factors which reduce infection rates. The approach is robust with respect to the number of undetected infection cases. We apply the framework to spatio-temporal infection data from Germany. In particular, we demonstrate that (1) infection rates are in average significantly decreasing in Germany; (2) there is a high spatial variability of these rates, and (3) both, early emergence of first infections and high local infection densities has led to strong recent decays in infection rates, suggesting that psychological effects (such as awareness of danger) lead to behaviour changes that reduce infection rates. However, the full potential of the presented method cannot yet be exploited, since more precise spatio-temporal data, such as local cell phone-based mobility data, are not yet available. In the nearest future, the presented framework could be applied to data from other countries at any state of infection, even during the exponential phase of the growth of infection rates.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz Mercker","author_inst":"BIONUM -  Consultants in biological and biomedical statistics, Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Uwe Betzin","author_inst":"User Experience Consultant, Schriesheim, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dennis Wilken","author_inst":"Institute of Geosciences, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nuno Rufino de Sousa","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Natali Papanicoloau","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064840","rel_title":"Estimate of Covid-19 prevalence using imperfect data","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064840","rel_abs":"The real number of people who were truly infected with SARS-CoV-2, is certainly significantly larger than the official record. Few countries have tracking and testing procedures that are sufficiently robust to discover nearly all infections. In most countries they are inadequate, hence the true extent of the pandemic is unknown. The current study proposes the estimate of the COVID-19 extent for countries with sufficiently high number of deaths and cases. The estimate is based on a simple model of mortality. This model was developed for a reference country with a large number of cases and high intensity of COVID-19 testing. The model is then applied to compute apparent mortality in the target and reference countries. The number of cases in the target country is then estimated assuming constant underlying true mortality. The estimate of cases in most countries is significantly higher than the official record. As of April 12, 2020, the global estimate is 5.2 million compared to 1.8 million in the official record. The models developed in this study are available at covid-model.net. The model ignores several factors that are known to influence mortality, such as the demographics and health condition of population, state of epidemic and sociological differences between countries. While the model is rough, it nevertheless provides a unified approach to producing a systematic global estimate of the extent of the COVID-19 epidemic and can be useful for its monitoring.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Witold R Rudnicki","author_inst":"University of Bia\u0142ystok"},{"author_name":"Rados\u0142aw Piliszek","author_inst":"University of Bia\u0142ystok"},{"author_name":"Dennis Wilken","author_inst":"Institute of Geosciences, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nuno Rufino de Sousa","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Natali Papanicoloau","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064824","rel_title":"Estimating the last day for COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064824","rel_abs":"Our main aim is to estimate the end of the first wave epidemic of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China.

On March 11, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on February 27, 2020. Methods This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria quantifying. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector) and adjusted for disease importation. Findings By April 11, 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28 - 15.18). Separately for travel related and local cases the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using three-weekly window while adjusting for travel related cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65 -8.41) at day 22 (March 19, 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% CrI: 3.83 -7.88) at day 25 (March 22, 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value at April 11, 2020 was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.26 - 1.58). Interpretation These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oyelola Adegboye","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Adeshina I Adekunle","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Ezra Gayawan","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Nuno Rufino de Sousa","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Natali Papanicoloau","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065128","rel_title":"Refined compartmental models, asymptomatic carriers and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065128","rel_abs":"The goal of this article is to analyze some compartmental models specially designed to model the spread of a disease whose transmission has the same features as COVID-19.

However, in resource-constrained countries such as the Philippines, test kits have limited availability. As of 12 April 2020, there are 11 testing centers in the country that have been accredited by the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct testing. In this paper, we determine the optimal percentage allocation of COVID-19 test kits among accredited testing centers in the Philippines that gives an equitable chance to all infected individuals to be tested. Heterogeneity in testing accessibility, population density of municipalities, and the capacity of testing facilities are included in the model. Our results showed that the range of optimal allocation per testing center are: Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (4.17%-6.34%), San Lazaro Hospital (14.65%-24.03%), University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (16.25%-44.80%), Lung Center of the Philippines (15.8%-26.40%), Baguio General Hospital Medical Center (0.58%-0.76%), The Medical City, Pasig City (5.96%-25.51%), St. Luke's Medical Center, Quezon City (1.09%-6.70%), Bicol Public Health Laboratory (0.06%-0.08%), Western Visayas Medical Center (0.71%-4.52%), Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (1.02%-2.61%), and Southern Philippines Medical Center (approx 0.01%). If there will be changes in the number of testing centers, our model can still be used to modify the test kit allocation. Our results can serve as a guide to the authorities in distributing the COVID-19 test kits. These can also be used to determine the capacity of testing centers and the effects of increasing its number. The model can also be used for proposing additional number and location of new testing centers.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Alvin H Buhat","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jessa Camille C Duero","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Edd Francis O Felix","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Mamplata","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065227","rel_title":"Model calibration, nowcasting, and operational prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065227","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has already caused huge human and economic cost, and will likely continue to do so for some time.

The positive implications of mitigation generally accrue as these measures are adopted early, with the most striking effects seen when the reproductive number is lowered to a level Rc{approx}1.0. As the delay in adopting measures exceeds approximately the half-way point to the peak of an outbreak, the effects of lowering R0 markedly decrease. Aiming for reproduction numbers close to 1.0 can substantially reduce fatality probabilities over short time scales, particularly for larger populations.

Due to possible extreme effects, such as hospitals potentially running out of beds or medical equipment, it is essential to lower the infection rate to create enough space to attend to the affected people and allow enough time for a vaccine to be developed. Unfortunately, this requires that measures put into place are upheld long enough to reduce the infection rate sufficiently. In this paper, we describe research simulating the influences of the contact rate on the spread of the pandemic using New York City as an example (Section IV) and especially already observed effects of contact rate increases during holidays [2-4] (Section V). In multiple simulations scenarios for Passover and Easter holidays, we evaluated 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% temporary increases in contact rates using a scenario close to the currently reported numbers as reference and contact rates based on bioterrorism research as a 'normal' baseline for NYC. The first general finding from the simulations is that singular events of increased visits\/contacts amplify each other disproportionately if they are happening in close proximity (time intervals) together. The second general observation was that contact rate spikes leave a permanently increased and devastating infection rate behind, even after the contact rate returns to the reduced one. In case of a temporary sustained increase of contact rate for just three days in a row, the aftermath results in an increase of infection rate up to 40%, which causes double the fatalities in the long run. In numbers, given that increases of 25% and 50% seem to be most likely given the data seen in Germany for the Easter weekend for example [2, 3], our simulations show the following increases (compared to the realistic reference run): for a temporary 25% surge in contact rate, the total cases grew by 215,880, the maximum of required hospitalizations over time increased to 63,063, and the total fatalities climbed by 8,844 accumulated over 90 days. As for the 50% surge, we saw the total number of cases rise by 461,090, the maximum number of required hospitalizations increase to 79,733, and the total number of fatalities climb by 19,125 over 90 days in NYC. All in all, we conclude that even very short, temporary increases in contact rates can have disproportionate effects and result in unrecoverable phenomena that can hardly be reversed or managed later. The numbers show possible phenomena before they might develop effects in reality. This is important because phenomena such as the described blip can impact the hospitals in reality. Therefore, we warn that a wave of infections due to increased contact rates during Passover\/Easter might come as a result!","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximilian Vierlboeck","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Roshanak R Nilchiani","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Christine M Edwards","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Mamplata","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065318","rel_title":"State-level variation of initial COVID-19 dynamics in the United States: The role of local government interventions","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065318","rel_abs":"During an epidemic, metrics such as R0, doubling time, and case fatality rates are important in understanding and predicting the course of an epidemic. However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the case number, and trajectory of cases, differs considerably between states. We show that early non-pharmaceutical, government actions, were the most important determinant of epidemic dynamics. In particular, restricting restaurant operations was correlated with increased doubling times. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Easton R White","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Laurent R H\u00e9bert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christine M Edwards","author_inst":"Stevens Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Mamplata","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065342","rel_title":"Estimate of COVID-19 case prevalence in India based on surveillance data of patients with severe acute respiratory illness","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065342","rel_abs":"In absence of extensive testing for SARS-CoV-2, true prevalence of COVID-19 cases in India remain unknown.

While the risk of death from COVID-19 increases non-linearly in age, within-age-group variation in COVID-19 death rates across countries suggests that age structure alone cannot account for observed differences in COVID-19 mortality risk. Age-related conditions that render the elderly less resistant to health shocks are non-obviously positively related to the survival environment. More favorable survival environments promote longevity and the accumulation of health frailty among the elderly while less favorable survival environments induce a mortality selection process that results in a lower amount of accumulated health frailty. To explain observed differences in COVID- 19 mortality across the countries of Europe, we employ cross-national variation in pre-existing age-specific probabilities of death to identify heterogeneous survival environments and produce model-generated measures of accumulated health frailty. We find a strong positive relationship between our model-generated measures of accumulated health frailty and COVID-19 death rates (r = 0.772, p < .001) across the countries of Europe, a result that is robust to statistical control for the timing and strength of epidemic seeding from exported cases, the capacity of healthcare systems to manage and survive infected persons, as well as the timing and stringency of non- pharmaceutical interventions. Our results oblige the stylized facts that the risk of COVID-19 mortality is nonlinearly increasing in age and that a disproportionate share of deaths are occurring among frail populations in long-term care facilities.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Levi Altringer","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Sammy Zahran","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Ashok Prasad","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Mamplata","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Martin Vondracek","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Johan Aarum","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hamzah Safari","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaman Muradrasoli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gigliotti Rothfuchs","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Bj\u00f6rn Reinius","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Kehu Yang","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20065532","rel_title":"Estimation of Tunisia COVID-19 infected cases based on mortality rate","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20065532","rel_abs":"Estimating the number of people affected by COVID-19 is crucial in deciding which public health policies to follow.

The specificity of whether or not deaths are rapid or not by COVID-19 also affects the number of actual cases. The number of days between the declaration of illness and death varies between 12 and 18 days. For a delay of 18 days, and using an estimated mortality rate of 2%, the number of cases in April 2020 in Tunisia would be 5 580 people.

Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from March 5 to April 23 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since March 17 2020). We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. As a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the local or regional scale.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastien Wurtzer","author_inst":"Eau de Paris"},{"author_name":"Vincent Marechal","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, F-75012, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Mouchel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, CNRS, EPHE, UMR 7619 Metis, 75005 PARIS, e-LTER Zone Atelier Seine, France"},{"author_name":"Yvon Maday","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, CNRS, Universite de Paris, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (LJLL), F-75005 Paris, France et Institut Universitaire de France"},{"author_name":"Remy Teyssou","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Institut de Recherche Biomedicale des Armees. 1 Place du General Valerie Andre.

It is found that the growth of the number of infected individuals $N(t)$ can be modeled across different states with a simple linear function $N(t)=\\gamma+\\alpha t$ beyond the date when reasonable number of individuals were tested (and when a countrywide lockdown was imposed). The slope $\\alpha$ is different for different states. Following recent work by Notari (arxiv:2003.12417), we then consider the dependency of the $\\alpha$ for different states on the average maximum and minimum temperatures, the average relative humidity and the population density in each state. It turns out that like other countries, the parameter $\\alpha$, which determines the rate of rise of the number of infected individuals, seems to have a weak correlation with the average maximum temperature of the state. In contrast, any significant variation of $\\alpha$ with humidity or minimum temperature seems absent with almost no meaningful correlation. Expectedly, $\\alpha$ increases (slightly) with increase in the population density of the states; however, the degree of correlation here too is negligible. These results seem to barely suggest that a natural cause like a hot summer (larger maximum temperatures) may contribute towards reducing the transmission of the virus, though the role of minimum temperature, humidity and population density remains somewhat obscure from the inferences which may be drawn from presently available data.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anushree Roy","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Sayan Kar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.
