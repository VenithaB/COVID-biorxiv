Yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory, given high susceptibility is a core driver. Here, we use a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic probing different scenarios of climate-dependence based on known coronavirus biology. We find that while variations in humidity may be important for endemic infections, during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 climate may drive only modest changes to pandemic size and duration. Our results suggest that, in the absence of effective control measures, significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid (warmer) climates, irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel E.

To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios. This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based models. We use the model to assess parameter sensitivity for a number of key variables that characterise the COVID-19 epidemic. We also test several control parameters with respect to their influence on the severity of the outbreak. Our analysis shows that due to inclusion of spatial heterogeneity in the population and the asynchronous timing of the epidemic across different areas, the severity of the epidemic might be lower than expected from other models. We find that one of the most crucial control parameters that may significantly reduce the severity of the epidemic is the degree of separation of vulnerable people and people aged 70 years and over, but note also that isolation of other groups has an effect on the severity of the epidemic. It is important to remember that models are there to advise and not to replace reality, and that any action should be coordinated and approved by public health experts with experience in dealing with epidemics. The computational approach makes it possible for further extensive scenario-based analysis to be undertaken. This and a comprehensive study of sensitivity of the model to different parameters defining COVID-19 and its development will be the subject of our forthcoming paper. In that paper, we shall also extend the model where we will consider different probabilistic scenarios for infected people with mild and severe cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anatoly Zhigljavsky","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Jack Noonan","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Ekta N Jayswal","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"C.

However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16{degrees}C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neaz A.

With no vaccine available and numerous national healthcare systems reaching or exceeding capacity, interventions to limit transmission are urgently needed. While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses and schools are beneficial in limiting local and regional spread, and such measures have been adopted in countries around the world, recommendations around the use of face masks for the general population are less consistent internationally. In this study, we examined the role of face masks in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the general population, using epidemic models to estimate the total reduction of infections and deaths under various scenarios. In particular, we examined the optimal deployment of face masks when resources are limited. We found that face masks, even with a limited protective effect, can reduce infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. We consistently found that a random distribution of masks in the population was a suboptimal strategy when resources were limited. Prioritizing coverage among the elderly was more beneficial, while allocating a proportion of available resources for diagnosed infected cases provided further mitigation under a range of scenarios. In summary, face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, can effectively provide some mitigation of transmission, while balancing provision between vulnerable healthy persons and symptomatic persons can optimize mitigation efforts when resources are limited.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colin J Worby","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Hsiao-Han Chang","author_inst":"National Tsing Hua University"},{"author_name":"Abbas Nazarian Madavani","author_inst":"Shahid Rajaee University"},{"author_name":"Jizhen Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Stephen X Zhang","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Edris Bazrafshan","author_inst":"Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Gholian-Aval Jr.","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052720","rel_title":"Mitigating COVID-19 outbreak via high testing capacity and strong transmission-intervention in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052720","rel_abs":"Most models of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States do not consider geographic variation, and their relevance to public policies is not straightforward.

Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days.

Of the 861 invitees, 221 responded. In the wake of the pandemic, 47.5% would reduce biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) while only 12.2% would reduce the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs. 64.2% were likely to defer change in IS, the reluctance being most with rituximab (58.3%) followed by cyclophosphamide (53.3%), anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (52.4%) and Janus kinase inhibitors (34.39%). Hydroxychloroquine was the preferred choice (81.9%) for the treatment of COVID-19 followed by protease inhibitors (22.1%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (8.1%). Chloroquine was less preferred (19%). More than two-thirds (70.5%) believed that COVID-19 might trigger macrophage activation syndrome. Social distancing (98.1%) and hand hygiene (74.6%) were recommended by majority. 62.8% would avoid touch for clinical examination whenever feasible. Conclusion.

Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved.

This paper aimed to pool the available data to provide a more complete picture of the characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic review and pooled analysis was performed. Eligible studies were identified from database and hand searches up to March 2, 2020. Data on clinical (including laboratory and radiological) and epidemiological (including demographic) characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases were extracted and combined by simple pooling. Results: Of 644 studies identified, 69 studies (involving 48,926 patients) were included in the analysis. The average age of the patients was 49.16 years. A total of 51.46% of the patients were men and 52.32% were non-smokers. Hypertension (50.82%) and diabetes (20.89%) were the most frequent comorbidities observed. The most common symptoms were fever (83.21%), cough (61.74%), and myalgia or fatigue (30.22%). Altered levels of blood and biochemical parameters were observed in a proportion of the patients. Most of the patients (78.50%) had bilateral lung involvements, and 5.86% showed no CT findings indicative of viral pneumonia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (28.36%), acute cardiac injury (7.89%) and acute kidney injury (7.60%) were the most common complications recorded.

Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies. Conclusions: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingming Liang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liang Gao","author_inst":"Saarland University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ce Cheng","author_inst":"Cape Fear Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Mayo clinic"},{"author_name":"John Patrick Uy","author_inst":"AMITA Health Saint Joseph Hospital Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kurt Heiner","author_inst":"Dignity Health Mercy Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chenyu Sun","author_inst":"AMITA Health Saint Joseph Hospital Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rui Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an"},{"author_name":"Lin Shi","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Baojun Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Hu Hu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yaling Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20050914","rel_title":"A statistical method of batch screening entrying population from abroad by stages and groups in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20050914","rel_abs":"Abstract Purpose: To screen for COVID-19 patients in immigration using minimal nucleic acid testing (NAT).

When the test results were positive, the group moved on to the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested individually for NAT. Results: The advantages and considerations of the method are discussed. Prevalence in the incoming population was a determinant of the sample size within the group. The lower the incidence, the larger the sample size within the group, the higher the savings in NAT and testing costs.

Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases. Design: Community survey. Setting and Participants: Subscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms. Main Exposure: Loss of smell and taste. Main Outcome Measures: COVID-19. Results: Between 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19. Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 . We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]. When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ana Valdes","author_inst":"NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Maxim B Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sajaysurya Ganesh","author_inst":"Zoe Global limited"},{"author_name":"Julia El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Pirro Hysi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ruth C E Bowyer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20052159","rel_title":"Efficient and Practical Sample Pooling High-Throughput PCR Diagnosis of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20052159","rel_abs":"Diagnostic assays using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) most commonly process patient samples one by one. While this is usually an effective and reliable method, the current efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic demand more efficient measures. Diagnostic assays can be scaled up by the method of High-Throughput qPCR via sample pooling. Pooling, the action of combining multiple samples into one tube, is most effective when the chance of positive detection of the target, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is low. In such cases, large groups of samples can be conclusively classified as negative with a single test, with no need to individually test every sample. However, different frequencies of the target-product presence in the samples, require different pool\/batch sizes for optimal results. Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARSCoV-2 testing on large scales, each one better suited for a different range of target frequency. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically. For example, this method achieves a reduction of a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2). For example, it reduces the number of tests needed by half if the frequency of positives samples is 0.07. We show that both methods are comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannon's source coding theorem. Our strategies require no investment at all, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. Both approaches are dynamic; they can be easily implemented in different conditions with various infection rates and sample numbers. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and also to alternative matrix methods. Most importantly, we offer practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale qPCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haran Shani-Narkiss","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Omri David Gilday","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Nadav Yayon","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Itamar Daniel Landau","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Julia El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Pirro Hysi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ruth C E Bowyer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20052241","rel_title":"A Systematic Meta-Analysis of CT Features of COVID-19: Lessons from Radiology","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20052241","rel_abs":"Several studies have been published in the past few months describing the CT features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

After an extensive literature search, we short-listed and reviewed 49 studies including over 4145 patients with 3615 RT-PCR positive cases of COVID-19 disease. We have found that there is a good agreement among these studies that diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is the most common finding at all stages of the disease followed by consolidations and mixed density lesions. 78% of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections had either ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both. Inter-lobular septal thickening was also found to be a common feature in many patients in advanced stages. The progression of these initial patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidations to diffuse lesions with septal thickening, air bronchograms in the advanced stages, to either diffuse white-out lungs needing ICU admissions or finally resolving completely without or with residual fibrotic strips was also found to be congruent among multiple studies. Prominent juxta-lesional pulmonary vessels, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy in RT-PCR proven cases were found to have poor clinical prognosis.

Methods An evidence-based reporting template was developed for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia using an FDA-approved medical software. The annotation of qualitative and quantitative findings including radiomics features is performed directly on primary imaging data. For data collection, secondary information from the patient history and clinical data such as symptoms and comorbidities are queried. Results License-royalty free, cloud-based web platform and on-premise deployments are offered. Hospitals can upload, assess, report and if pseudonymized share their COVID-19 cases. The aggregation of radiomics in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically documented in a single database, will lead to optimized diagnosis, risk stratification and response evaluation. A customizable analytics dashboard allows the explorative real-time data analysis of imaging features and clinical information.

Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protection in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used and easily deployable, scalable disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Among these, heating ([&le;]85 {degrees}C) under various humidities ([&le;]100% RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. Heating can be applied up to 50 cycles (85 {degrees}C, 30% RH) without observation in the degradation of meltblown filtration performance. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can also potentially impact the material strength and fit of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach may all lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Liao","author_inst":"4C Air, inc."},{"author_name":"Wang Xiao","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mervin Zhao","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Xuanze Yu","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Haotian Wang","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Qiqi Wang","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20053983","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20053983","rel_abs":"Background: On December 2019, Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China, and then spread around the world. There is little information about effects of COVID-19 on Pregnant women and newborns as a sensitive population. The current study is a systemic review and Meta-analysis to measure the risks and determine the presentations of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborn. Methods: online data bases were searched on march 20. Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and Higgins I2 statistic and expressed as percentage. All data were analyzed with 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 7 studies involving 50 participants with Positive test of COVID-19 were enrolled. Mean age of pregnant women was 30.57 years old and the Mean Gestational age was 36.9 weeks. Other variables such as Apgar score, birth weight, Sign and symptoms, Complications and Laboratory data were Analyzed. Conclusion: Our findings showed same clinical characteristics in pregnant women as in non-pregnant adults, with the main symptoms being cough and fever. No vertical transmission was seen and all patients delivered healthy neonates. Our findings would be of great help to the decision making process, regarding the management of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sina Arabi","author_inst":"Applied Physiology Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."},{"author_name":"Golnaz Vaseghi","author_inst":"Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."},{"author_name":"Zahra Heidari","author_inst":"Cardiac Rehabilitation Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Isfahan University of Medical Scienc"},{"author_name":"Laleh Shariati","author_inst":"Applied Physiology Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."},{"author_name":"Bahareh Amin","author_inst":"Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, Iran."},{"author_name":"Harunor Rashid","author_inst":"National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia."},{"author_name":"Shaghayegh Haghjooy Javanmard","author_inst":"Applied Physiology Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052175","rel_title":"Toilets dominate environmental detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a hospital","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052175","rel_abs":"Background: Respiratory and faecal aerosols play a suspected role in transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Methods: We collected data of the Covid-19 patients. 107 surface samples, 46 air samples, two exhaled condensate samples, and two expired air samples were collected were collected within and beyond the four three-bed isolation rooms. We reviewed the environmental design of the building and the cleaning routines. We conducted field measurement of airflow and CO2 concentrations. Findings: The 107 surface samples comprised 37 from toilets, 34 from other surfaces in isolation rooms (ventilated at 30-60 L\/s), and 36 from other surfaces outside isolation rooms in the hospital. Four of these samples were positive, namely two ward door-handles, one bathroom toilet-seat cover and one bathroom door-handle; and three were weakly positive, namely one bathroom toilet seat, one bathroom washbasin tap lever and one bathroom ceiling-exhaust louvre. One of the 46 air samples was weakly positive, and this was a corridor air sample. The two exhaled condensate samples and the two expired air samples were negative. Interpretation: The faecal-derived aerosols in patients' toilets contained most of the detected SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hospital, highlighting the importance of surface and hand hygiene for intervention.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhen Ding","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for disease control and prevention"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Bin Xu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Huang","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lunbiao Cui","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaosong Wu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Shao","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Sha","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lian Zhou","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20050245","rel_title":"Analysis and Applications of Non-Adaptive and Adaptive Group Testing Methods for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20050245","rel_abs":"Abstract Testing strategies for Covid-19 to maximize number of people tested is urgently needed. Recently, it has been demonstrated that RT-PCR has the sensitivity to detect one positive case in a mixed sample 32 cases [9]. In this paper we propose non-adaptive and adaptive group testing strategies based on generalized binary splitting (GBS) [2] where we restrict the group test to the largest group that can be used. The method starts by choosing a group from the population to be tested, performing a test on the combined sample from the entire group and progressively splitting the group further into subgroups. Compared to individual testing at 4% prevalence we save 74% at 1% we save 91% and at 1% we save 97% of tests. We analyze the number of times each sample is used and show the method is still efficient if we resort to testing a case individually if the sample is running low. Abstract In addition we recommend clinical screening to filter out individuals with symptoms and show this leaves us with a population with lower prevalence. Our approach is particularly applicable to vulnerable confined populations such as nursing homes, prisons, military ships and cruise ships.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cassidy Mentus","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin Romeo","author_inst":"Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Christian DiPaola","author_inst":"UMass Memorial"},{"author_name":"Ying Huang","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lunbiao Cui","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaosong Wu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Shao","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Sha","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lian Zhou","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20054155","rel_title":"The relationship of COVID-19 severity with cardiovascular disease and its traditional risk factors: A systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20054155","rel_abs":"Background: Whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its traditional risk factors predict severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uncertain, in part, because of potential confounding by age and sex. Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data ([&ge;]10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 vs. <50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR=1.73, [95%CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. For the other three factors, meta-regression analyses suggested confounding by age. Only four studies reported multivariable analysis, but most of them showed adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the potential for confounding, these results suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are independently associated with severe COVID-19 and, together with age and male sex, can be used to inform objective decisions on COVID-19 testing, clinical management, and workforce planning.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kunihiro Matsushita","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ning Ding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Minghao Kou","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Xiao Hu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mengkun Chen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yumin Gao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Honda","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"David Dowdy","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yejin Mok","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Junichi Ishigami","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence J Appel","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Li Sha","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lian Zhou","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20051540","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 titers in wastewater are higher than expected from clinically confirmed cases","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20051540","rel_abs":"Wastewater surveillance may represent a complementary approach to measure the presence and even prevalence of infectious diseases when the capacity for clinical testing is limited. Moreover, aggregate, population-wide data can help inform modeling efforts. We tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts and found the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at high titers in the period from March 18 - 25 using RT-qPCR. We then confirmed the identity of the PCR product by direct DNA sequencing. Viral titers observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinically confirmed cases in Massachusetts as of March 25. The reason for the discrepancy is not yet clear, however, and until further experiments are complete, these data do not necessarily indicate that clinical estimates are incorrect. Our approach is scalable and may be useful in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fuqing Wu","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Departments of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Tech"},{"author_name":"Amy Xiao","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Departments of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Tech"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Departments of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Tech"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiong Gu","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Kauffman","author_inst":"University of Buffalo, The State University of New York"},{"author_name":"William Hanage","author_inst":"Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.
