Unlike RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions. However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be widely implemented.\n\nMethodsWe performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and compared it to targeted SARS-CoV-2 full genome amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To track virus origin, we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to publicly available sequences.\n\nResultsWe show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2. With enrichment, more than 99% of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of 0.63% without enrichment. Consequently, a dramatic increase in genome coverage was obtained using significantly less sequencing data, enabling higher scalability and significant cost reductions. We also demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains.\n\nConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is a practical, cost-effective, and powerful approach for population-based surveillance and control of viral transmission in the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Divinlal Harilal","author_inst":"Al Jalila Genomics Center, Al Jalila Childrens Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"},{"author_name":"Sathishkumar Ramaswamy","author_inst":"Al Jalila Genomics Center, Al Jalila Childrens Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"},{"author_name":"Tom Loney","author_inst":"College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates."},{"author_name":"Hanan Alsuwaidi","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hamda Khansaheb","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Abdulmajeed AlKhajeh","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Rupa Varghese","author_inst":"Microbiology and Infection Control Unit, Pathology and Genetics Department, Latifa Women and Children Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, Dubai, United Arab Emira"},{"author_name":"Zulfa Deesi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Infection Control Unit, Pathology and Genetics Department, Latifa Women and Children Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, Dubai, United Arab Emira"},{"author_name":"Norbert Nowotny","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria."},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates."},{"author_name":"Ahmad Abou Tayoun","author_inst":"Al Jalila Genomics Center, Al Jalila Childrens Hospital, and College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.137331","rel_title":"Effects of Renin-Angiotensin Inhibition on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Expression","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.137331","rel_abs":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. To determine whether the renin-angiotensin inhibition regulates ACE2 expression, either enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or losartan (an AT1 receptor blocker) was infused subcutaneously to male C57BL\/6J mice for two weeks. Neither enalapril nor losartan changed abundance of ACE2 mRNA in lung, ileum, kidney, and heart. Viral entry also depends on transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to prime the S protein. TMPRSS2 mRNA was abundant in lungs and ileum, modest in kidney, but barely detectable in heart. TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance was not altered by either enalapril or losartan in any of the 4 tissues. Next, we determined whether depletion of angiotensinogen (AGT), the unique substrate of the renin-angiotensin system, changes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance. AGT antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) were injected subcutaneously to male C57BL\/6J mice for 3 weeks. Abundance of ACE2 mRNA was unchanged in any of the 4 tissues, but TMPRSS2 mRNA was significantly decreased in lungs.

As of the 31st of May, 2020, there have been more than 6 million COVID-19 cases diagnosed worldwide and over 370,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 strains have been sequenced to date, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of the virus on a global scale. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of over 1,225 SARS-CoV-2 genomes spanning from late December 2019 to mid-March 2020. We identified a missense mutation, D614G, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe (954 of 1,449 (66%) sequences) and is spreading worldwide (1,237 of 2,795 (44%) sequences). Molecular dating analysis estimated the emergence of this clade around mid-to-late January (10 - 25 January) 2020. We also applied structural bioinformatics to assess D614G potential impact on the virulence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In silico analyses on the spike protein structure suggests that the mutation is most likely neutral to protein function as it relates to its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor. The lack of clinical metadata available prevented our investigation of association between viral clade and disease severity phenotype. Future work that can leverage clinical outcome data with both viral and human genomic diversity is needed to monitor the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sandra Isabel","author_inst":"The Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Lucia Grana-Miraglia","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Jahir M Gutierrez","author_inst":"Layer 6 AI"},{"author_name":"Cedoljub Bundalovic-Torma","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Helen E Groves","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Marc R Isabel","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Alireza Eshaghi","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Samir N Patel","author_inst":"Public Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Gubbay","author_inst":"Publich Health Ontario"},{"author_name":"Tomi Poutanen","author_inst":"Layer 6 AI"},{"author_name":"David S Guttman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Susan M Poutanen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123711","rel_title":"Prevention of household transmission crucial to stop the catastrophic spread of COVID-19 in cities","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123711","rel_abs":"After weeks under lockdown, metropolitan areas fighting the spread of COVID-19 aim to balance public health goals with social and economic standards for well-being. Mathematical models of disease transmission seeking to evaluate mitigation strategies must assess the possible impacts of social distancing, economic lockdowns and other measures. However, obscure relations between model parameters and real-world phenomena complicate such analyses. Here, we use a high-resolution metapopulation model of Guadalajara (GDL, Western Mexico) to represent daily mobility patterns driven by economic activities and their relation to epidemic growth. Given the prominence of essential activities in the city's economy, we find that strategies aiming to mitigate the risk of out-of-home interactions are insufficient to stop the catastrophic spread of COVID-19. Using baseline reproduction numbers R0 = [2.5, 3.0] in the absence of interventions, our simulations suggest that household transmission alone can make Rt ~ 1, and is estimated to drive 70 {+\/-} 15% of current epidemic growth. This sets an upper bound for the impact of mobility-based interventions, which are unlikely to lower Rt below 1.3 and must be complemented with aggressive campaigns for early case detection and isolation. As laboratory testing and health services become insufficient to meet demand in GDL and most other cities, we propose that cities facilitate guidelines and equipment to help people curb spreading within their own homes. Postponing these actions will increase their economic cost and decrease their potential returns.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noel Gutierrez Brizuela","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Humberto Gutierrez Pulido","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Kimberlyn Roosa","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Nestor Garcia Chan","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Jorge Hernandez-Bello","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Jose Francisco Munoz-Valle","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Macedo-Ojeda","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Javier Alonso Lopez-Chavez","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Gonzalez Estevez","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Villanueva Lomeli","author_inst":"Universidad de Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Susan M Poutanen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20123893","rel_title":"Public health interventions in India slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20123893","rel_abs":"Background The government of India implemented social distancing interventions to contain the COVID-19 epidemic. However, effects on epidemic dynamics are yet to be understood. Methods Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections per day and effective reproduction number (Rt) were estimated for 4 periods (Pre-lockdown and Lockdown Phases 1 to 3) according to nationally implemented phased interventions. Adoption of these interventions was estimated using Google mobility data. Estimates at the national level and for 12 Indian states most affected by COVID-19 are presented. Findings Daily case rates ranged from 0.03 to 30.05\/10 million people across 4 discrete periods in India. From May 4-17, 2020, the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi had the highest case rate (222\/10 million people\/day), whereas Kerala had the lowest (2.18\/10 million\/day). Average Rt was 1.99 (95% CI 1.93-2.06) for India; it ranged from 1.38 to 2.78, decreasing over time. Median mobility in India decreased in all contact domains, with the lowest being 21% in retail\/recreation (95% CI 13-46%), except home which increased to 129% (95% CI 117-132%) compared to the 100% baseline value. Interpretation The Indian government imposed strict contact mitigation, followed by a phased relaxation, which slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic progression in India. The identified daily COVID-19 case rates and Rt will aid national and state governments in formulating ongoing COVID-19 containment plans. Furthermore, these findings may inform COVID-19 public health policy in developing countries with similar settings to India.

Model parameters are shown to be correlated to different management strategies by employing machine learning enabling the comparison among different strategies. Treatment of population data with the model shows that restricted non-essential business closure, school closing and strictures on mass gathering influence the spread of infection.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, reports have surfaced of children who present with features of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with overlapping features of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome - Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome- temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (PIMS-TS). Initial reports find that many of the children are PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, so it is difficult to confirm whether this syndrome is a late complication of viral infection in an age group largely spared the worst consequences of this infection, or if this syndrome reflects enhanced surveillance. Methods. Children hospitalised for symptoms consistent with PIMS-TS between 28 April and 8 May 2020, and who were PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, were tested for antibodies to viral spike glycoprotein using an ELISA test. Results. Eight patients (age range 7-14 years, 63% male) fulfilled case-definition for PIMS-TS during the study period. Six of the eight patients required admission to intensive care. All patients exhibited significant IgG and IgA responses to viral spike glycoprotein. Further assessment showed that the IgG isotypes detected in children with PIMS-TS were of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, a distribution similar to that observed in samples from hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients. In contrast, IgG2 and IgG4 were not detected in children or adults. IgM was not detected in children, which contrasts with adult hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients of whom all had positive IgM responses. Conclusions. Strong IgG antibody responses can be detected in PCR-negative children with PIMS-TS. The low detection rate of IgM in these patients is consistent with infection having occurred weeks previously and that the syndrome onset occurs well after the control of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This implies that the disease is largely immune-mediated. Lastly, this indicates that serology can be an appropriate diagnostic tool in select patient groups.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marisol Perez-Toledo","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sian E.

To address this pandemic broad testing with an easy, comfortable and reliable testing method is of utmost concern. The nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is the reference method though hampered by international supply shortages. A new oropharyngeal\/nasal (OP\/N) sampling method was investigated using the more readily available throat swab. Methods: In this prospective observational study 36 COVID-19 patients were tested with both a NP and combined OP\/N swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR. In hospitalized suspect patients, who tested negative on both swabs, extensive retesting was performed. The sensitivity of NP versus combined OP\/N swab sampling on admission and the correlation between viral RNA loads recovered was investigated. Results: 35 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by means of either NP or OP\/N sampling. The paired swabs were both positive in 31 patients. The one patient who tested negative on both NP and OP\/N swab on admission, was ultimately diagnosed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A strong correlation was found between the viral RNA loads of the paired swabs (r = 0.76; P < 0.05). The sensitivity of NP and OP\/N analysis in hospitalized patients (n = 28) was 89.3% and 92.7% respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates equivalence of NP and OP\/N sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by means of rRT-PCR. Sensitivity of both NP and OP\/N sampling is very high in hospitalized patients.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tania Desmet","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter De Paepe","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jerina Boelens","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liselotte Coorevits","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elizaveta Padalko","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stien Vandendriessche","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabel Leroux-Roels","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Annelies Aerssens","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven Callens","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eva Van Braeckel","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Malfait","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Frank Vermassen","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bruno Verhasselt","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ashish Chikermane","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kavitha Masilamani","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Scholefield","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Adam F.

Based on the current mechanistic understanding of how VRDs are transmitted by small droplets, we identify an environmental variable, Air Drying Capacity (ADC), as an atmospheric state-variable with significant and direct relevance to the transmission of VRD. ADC dictates the evolution and fate of droplets under given temperature and humidity conditions. The definition of this variable is rooted in the Maxwell theory of droplet evolution via coupled heat and mass transfer between droplets and the surrounding environment. We present the climatology of ADC, and compare its observed distribution in space and time to the observed prevalence of influenza and COVID-19 from extensive global data sets. Globally, large ADC values appear to significantly constrain the observed transmission and spread of VRD, consistent with the significant coherency of the observed seasonal cycles of ADC and influenza. Our results introduce a new environmental determinant, rooted in the mechanism of VRD transmission, with potential implications for explaining seasonality of influenza, and for describing how environmental conditions may impact to some degree the evolution of similar VRDs, such as COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yeon-Woo Choi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Tuel","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elfatih A.

Exclusion criteria included: (1) intake more than 10 days after symptom onset, (2) hospitalization for covid-19, (3) symptoms at less than two visits. Main outcome measures: Symptom duration in days Results: Common symptoms at diagnosis are upper respiratory (64% cough, 53% loss of smell or taste, 50% sinus congestion, 22% sore throat), systemic (50% headache, 48% body aches, 36% chills, 22% dizziness, 18% fever). The most frequent remaining symptoms at 30 days were cough (7%), loss of smell or taste (5%), body aches (5%), nasal congestion (5%), shortness of breath with exertion (5%), and joint pain (5%). Day of symptom onset was earliest for upper respiratory symptoms (mean 1.26 days, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.4), followed by systemic symptoms (1.54, 1.39 to 1.7), with later onset of lower respiratory (2.86, 2.54 to 3.22) and gastrointestinal symptoms (3.46, 3.07 to 3.89), when present. Cough had the longest duration when present with 12.2 days (10.9 to 13.6). Loss of smell or taste had the second longest duration with 11.0 days (9.9 to 12.2). Provider-Assessed Symptom Severity (PASS) is the best predictor of symptom duration (P <0.005 for multiple symptoms) and patients with Moderate PASS compared to Mild at their intake visit have higher rates of symptoms at 30 days, including cough (12%), nasal congestion (10%), joint pain (10%), body aches (9%), loss of taste or smell (7%), headache (7%), and shortness of breath with exertion (6%). Conclusions: Covid-19 illness in outpatients follows a pattern of progression from systemic symptoms to lower respiratory symptoms and persistent symptoms are common across categories.

MEDLINE PubMed, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Science, Clinical Key, and CINAHL databases were used to select the studies. Then, 384 articles were received, including the studies until 01\/MAY\/2020. As a result of the full-text evaluation, 12 retrospective articles covering all the data related were selected. A total of 181 pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, the incidence of fever was 38.1% (95% CI: 14.2-65%), and cough was 22% (95% CI: 10.8-35.2%) among all clinical features of pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, fever and cough are the most common symptoms in pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 91.8% (95% CI: 76.7-99.9%) of RT-PCR results are positive. Moreover, abnormal CT incidence is 97.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.9%) positive. No case was death. However, as this virus spreads globally, it should not be overlooked that the incidence will increase in pregnant women and may be in the risky group. RT-PCR and CT can be used together in an accurate and safe diagnosis. In conclusion, these findings will provide important guidance for current studies regarding the clinical features and correct detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as whether it will create emergency tables that will require the use of a viral drug.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Banu Uygun-Can","author_inst":"Marmara University"},{"author_name":"Bilge Acar-Bolat","author_inst":"Istanbul University, School of Business, Department of Quantitative Methods."},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pareschi","author_inst":"Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) Milano\/Merate, Italy."},{"author_name":"Adalberto Cavalleri","author_inst":"Department of Imaging Diagnostic and Radioterapy, IRCCS Foundation, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Cavatorta","author_inst":"Department of Imaging Diagnostic and Radioterapy, IRCCS Foundation, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Claudio Fenizia","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

Spain had a program for universal BCG vaccination until 1981. Objective: To see whether cohorts born when Spain had a program of universal BCG vaccination had lower rates of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and mortality (relative to similar cohorts in Italy). Methods: We compare COVID-19 mortality and confirmed cases for those born roughly a decade before and after 1981. We compare the outcomes to the same age cohorts in Italy, which never had universal BCG vaccination. Results: The Spanish cohort that received BCG had a relative risk of 0.962 of having a confirmed case of COVID-19. This risk is statistically significantly below unity (95% CI 0.952 to 0.972, P< 0.001). There is also suggestive evidence the BCG cohort in Spain had lower mortality (relative risk 0.929, CI 0.850 to 1.01, P = 0.11). The small sample size makes this test underpowered. Conclusion: These suggestive results provide a shred of evidence that BCG vaccinations help protect against COVID.

The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in a population of healthy blood donors living under strict lockdown measures in Jordan which has in total 144 confirmed cases per million population. Methods: Left-over sera and plasma samples from 746 healthy blood donors were tested using a commercially available FDA approved kit having a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99.8% respectively. External positive controls were used for validation. Results: More than 80% of the donors were men 18-63 year old and residing in the capital city of Jordan, Amman. All tested specimens were negative yielding a zero seroprevalence rate in this healthy blood donor population. Conclusion: Strict lockdown measures effectively limit intracommunity spread of the infection, however at the cost of lack of any acquired community immunity. Additionally the use of highly specific test is recommended in low prevalence setting.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maher A Sughayer","author_inst":"king Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Asem Mansour","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Abeer Al Nuirat","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lina Souan","author_inst":"king Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ghanem","author_inst":"king Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Siag","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Paola Galli","author_inst":"1 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) Milano\/Merate, Italy."},{"author_name":"Luigi Lessio","author_inst":"4 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Manuela Lualdi","author_inst":"Department of Imaging Diagnostic and Radioterapy, IRCCS Foundation, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Redaelli","author_inst":"1 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF)  Milano\/Merate, Italy."},{"author_name":"Irma Saulle","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

Temporal analysis of the main markers showed low variability across the 5 days of analysis, compared with sepsis patients. Conclusions: Heart rate variability is broadly implicated across patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and admitted to the ICU for critical illness. Comparing these metrics to patients with all-cause sepsis suggests a unique set of expressions that differentiate this viral phenotype. This finding could be investigated further as a potential biomarker to predict poor outcome in this patient population, and could also be a starting point to measure potential autonomic dysfunction in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rishikesan Kamaleswaran","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ofer Sadan","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Prem Kandiah","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiao Li","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James M Blum","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig M Coopersmith","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy G Buchman","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luigi Lessio","author_inst":"4 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Manuela Lualdi","author_inst":"Department of Imaging Diagnostic and Radioterapy, IRCCS Foundation, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Redaelli","author_inst":"1 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF)  Milano\/Merate, Italy."},{"author_name":"Irma Saulle","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

Situations like physical distancing as well as being constantly tagged as the most vulnerable group could expose older adults to mental and psychosocial burdens. Nonetheless, there is little clarity about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar pandemics in the past on the mental illness, wellbeing, and psychosocial health of the older population compared to other age groups. Objectives: To describe the patterns of older adults' mental and psychosocial health related to acute respiratory disease propagated-type epidemics and pandemics and to evaluate the differences with how other age groups respond. Eligibility criteria: quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating mental illness, wellbeing, or psychosocial health outcomes associated with respiratory propagated epidemics and pandemics exposure or periods (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza) in people 65 years or older. Data source: Original articles published until June 1st, 2020, in any language searched in the electronic healthcare and social sciences database: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, WHO Global literature on coronavirus disease database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (  - CNKI). Furthermore, EPPI Centre's COVID-19 living systematic map and the publicly available publication list of the COVID-19 living systematic review will be incorporated for preprints and recent COVID-19 publications. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers will extract predefined parameters. The risk of bias will be assessed. Data synthesis: Data synthesis will be performed according to study type and design, type of epidemic and pandemic, types of outcomes (mental health and psychosocial outcomes), and participant characteristics (e.g., sex, race, age, socioeconomic status, food security, presence of dependency in daily life activities independent\/dependent older adults). Comparison between sex, race, and other age groups will be performed qualitatively, and quantitatively if enough data is available. The risk of bias and study heterogeneity will be reported for quantitative studies. Conclusion: This study will provide information to take actions to address potential mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults and to understand responses on this age group. Furthermore, it will be useful to identify potential groups that are more vulnerable or resilient to the mental-health challenges of the current worldwide pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose M Aravena","author_inst":"Department of Social & Behavioral Sciences, School of Public Health, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Cristopher Aceituno","author_inst":"Chilean-German Beneficence Corporation, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Kate Nyhan","author_inst":"Harvey Cushing \/ John Hay Whitney Medical Library, Environmental Health Sciences, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Kewei Shi","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Sten Vermund","author_inst":"School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Becca R Levy","author_inst":"Department of Social & Behavioral Sciences, School of Public Health, Yale University."},{"author_name":"Timothy G Buchman","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luigi Lessio","author_inst":"4 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Manuela Lualdi","author_inst":"Department of Imaging Diagnostic and Radioterapy, IRCCS Foundation, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Redaelli","author_inst":"1 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF)  Milano\/Merate, Italy."},{"author_name":"Irma Saulle","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

Proper hand hygiene was identified as one of the simplest most cost effective Covid-19 control and prevention measures. It is therefore very important to understand the compliance of the community to hand hygiene. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of Makerere University and residents of Katanga slum from 17th to 22nd of March, 2020. An interviewer guided questionnaire with questions on knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers to hand hygiene was used in data collection. The collected data was analyzed using Microsoft office excel 2016 and STATA 15 software. A 95% confidence interval was used and statistical significance was P<0.05. Results Only 8.4% of the participants had good knowledge of hand hygiene. 11.7% of the university students had good knowledge compared to 0.9% of the Katanga residents. 29.0% of the participants had a good attitude while 50.1% had a moderate attitude to hand hygiene. University students were 6.3 times (OR: 6.3, 95%C1: (2.1 18.5), P=0.001) more likely to have good knowledge while Katanga residents were 3.6 times (OR: 3.6, 95%C1: (1.5 8.4), P=0.003) more likely to have good attitude to hand hygiene. Only 19.6% accomplished all the seven steps of handwashing. 38.4% of the participants still greeted by handshaking and 60.1% noted lack of soap as a barrier to hand hygiene and 62.9% reported having more than three barriers to hand hygiene. Participants that had been taught handwashing were more likely to have better hand hygiene knowledge and practice. Conclusion Despite a fair attitude, deficiency of knowledge coupled with many barriers such as Lack of soap hindered the Practice of proper hand hygiene. Public health involvement to promote hand hygiene must be promoted.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julius Nuwagaba","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dave Darsit Ashok","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas Balizzakiwa","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Kisengula","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edna Joyce Nagaddya","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Meddy Rutayisire","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy G Buchman","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luigi Lessio","author_inst":"4 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Manuela Lualdi","author_inst":"Department of Imaging Diagnostic and Radioterapy, IRCCS Foundation, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Redaelli","author_inst":"1 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF)  Milano\/Merate, Italy."},{"author_name":"Irma Saulle","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200-5,000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 x 103 copies\/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 x 103-8.2 x 104 copies\/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 x 102-2.5 x 103 copies\/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5,000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked in the community. This is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Japan.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eiji Haramoto","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Bikash Malla","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Ocean Thakali","author_inst":"University of Yamanashi"},{"author_name":"Masaaki Kitajima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Edna Joyce Nagaddya","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Meddy Rutayisire","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Health Sciences; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy G Buchman","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luigi Lessio","author_inst":"4 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Manuela Lualdi","author_inst":"Department of Imaging Diagnostic and Radioterapy, IRCCS Foundation, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Redaelli","author_inst":"1 Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF)  Milano\/Merate, Italy."},{"author_name":"Irma Saulle","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

As we overlay the global mobility map with epidemic incidence curves and dates of government interventions, we observe that as case counts rose, mobility fell and has since then seen a slow but steady increase in flows. Further, in order to understand mixing within a region, we propose a new metric to quantify the effect of social distancing on the basis of mobility.Taking two very different countries sampled from the global spectrum, We analyze in detail the mobility patterns of the United States (US) and India. We then carry out a counterfactual analysis of delaying the lockdown and show that a one week delay would have doubled the reported number of cases in the US and India. Finally, we quantify the effect of college students returning back to school for the fall semester on COVID-19 dynamics in the surrounding community. We employ the data from a recent university outbreak (reported on August 16, 2020) to infer possible Reff values and mobility flows combined with daily prevalence data and census data to obtain an estimate of new cases that might arrive on a college campus. We find that maintaining social distancing at existing levels would be effective in mitigating the extra seeding of cases. However, potential behavioral change and increased social interaction amongst students (30% increase in Reff) along with extra seeding can increase the number of cases by 20% over a period of one month in the encompassing county. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model in near real-time, the interplay of human mobility, epidemic dynamics and public policies across multiple spatial resolutions and at a global scale.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aniruddha Adiga","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Lijing Wang","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Adam Sadilek","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Ashish Tendulkar","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Srinivasan Venkatramanan","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Anil Vullikanti","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Aggarwal","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Alok Talekar","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Samarth Swarup","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kavitha Masilamani","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Scholefield","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Adam F.

Based on the interim guidelines of WHO, most of the countries opted for social distancing with lockdown as the only way to control the pandemic. This led to Manufacturing shut down, which acted as a spanner in the wheel for international supply chain leading to pressure on governments to review the protocols of the lockdown. We studied epidemiological parameters for 18 countries and obtained crossover time point referring to cumulative case active and case recovery rates and the time point for the peak positive confirmation rate in a time window of 92 days; and linked with the respective governmental decisions. For countries awaiting crossover, time series non-linear models could be used for predicting the crossover point. A sample study was carried out for India. The median time for reaching crossover for 12 countries was 37 days, while peak positive confirmation rate was 30 days after their first intervention. These countries enforced strict lockdown regulations and have shown constant improvement in their recovery rate even after crossover time point. A phase wise relaxation of lockdown is evident after crossover point in most of these countries. The crossover time point with the subsequent increasing recovery rate can be a strategy for lockdown relaxation as evident from the experiences of few countries. Also, we propose a criterion based on cumulative recovery and fatality rate for micro-management of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhananjay V Raje","author_inst":"MDS Bio-Analytics, Shankar Nagar, Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Abhay Bajaj","author_inst":"CSIR-NEERI"},{"author_name":"Moumita Chakraborty","author_inst":"MDS Bio-Analytics, Shankar Nagar, Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Hemant J.

To fill this gap, we estimate the adjustments required to extrapolate estimates of the IFR from high- to lower-income regions. Accounting for differences in the distribution of age, sex, and relevant comorbidities yields substantial differences in the predicted IFR across 21 world regions, ranging from 0.11% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 0.95% for High Income Asia Pacific. However, these predictions must be treated as lower bounds, as they are grounded in fatality rates from countries with advanced health systems. In order to adjust for health system capacity, we incorporate regional differences in the relative odds of infection fatality from childhood influenza. This adjustment greatly diminishes, but does not entirely erase, the demography-based advantage predicted in the lowest income settings, with regional estimates of the predicted COVID-19 IFR ranging from 0.43% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.74% for Eastern Europe.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Selene Ghisolfi","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Ingvild Ingvild Almas","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Justin Sandefur","author_inst":"Center for Global Development"},{"author_name":"Tillman von Carnap","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Jesse Heitner","author_inst":"Aceso Global"},{"author_name":"Tessa Bold","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Aggarwal","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Alok Talekar","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Samarth Swarup","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kavitha Masilamani","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Scholefield","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Adam F.

Design Three cross-sectional surveys. Participants Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012, and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results: The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% confidence intervals [95% CI] 31.4-32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p<0.001). In people aged [&ge;]65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). Similarly, a decrease in vaccine uptake was seen in people with poor self-reported health status (39.4%, 33.1%, and 27.0%). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65 to 75 years old (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) aOR 0.56, 95% Cl 0.48-0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.03). Uptake was positively associated with the [&ge;]65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private\/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession, and having any underlying chronic disease. Use of any alternative medicine therapy was negatively associated with influenza vaccination (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.67-0.80). Conclusion: Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill persons. Significant efforts are required in preparing for the flu season 2020\/21 to reduce the double burden of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. These efforts should include campaigns but also novel approaches using social media.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathrin Zuercher","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Marcel Zwahlen","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Claudia Berlin","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Matthias Egger","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lukas Fenner","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Tessa Bold","author_inst":"Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES), Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Aggarwal","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Alok Talekar","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Jiangzhuo Chen","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Bryan Lewis","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Samarth Swarup","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Madhav Marathe","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kavitha Masilamani","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Scholefield","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Adam F.

In its severe form, patients progress to respiratory failure. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation restrictions and early orotracheal intubation have collapsed health systems due to insufficient intensive care unit beds and mechanical ventilators. COVID-19 dedicated healthcare professionals have high infection rates. This publication describes experimental testing of the Protection and Isolation System for Patients with COVID-19 (PISP\/COVID-19). Method PISP\/COVID-19 is a disposable transparent polyethylene plastic that covers the patient's entire hospital bed, with its internal air aspirated by the hospital's vacuum system attached to a microparticle filter. Experiments validated PISP\/COVID-19's ability to block aerosolized microparticles dissemination. Caffeine was used as a molecular marker, with leakage evaluation through sensors analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The biological marker was synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) as the detection method. Results PISP\/COVID-19 was effective against molecular and biological markers environmental dispersion in simulations of non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and mechanical ventilation isolation. Caffeine was not detected in any of the sensors positioned at points outside the PISP\/COVID-19. The ability of PISP\/COVID-19 to retain virus particles and protect the surrounding environment was confirmed by detection and gradients quantification of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Conclusion PISP\/COVID-19 was effective in the retention of the molecular and biological markers in all tested simulations. Considering the current pandemic, PISP\/COVID-19 might increase the use of non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and provide additional protection to healthcare professionals.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Almeida Quadros","author_inst":"University of Bahia State, Department of Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Maria Carolina BDM Leal","author_inst":"Sao Carlos Federal University, Department of Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Baptista-Sobrinho","author_inst":"University Center of Planalto Central Aparecido dos Santos"},{"author_name":"Carolina KV Nonaka","author_inst":"Center for Biotechnology and Cell Therapy, Sao Rafael Hospital.
