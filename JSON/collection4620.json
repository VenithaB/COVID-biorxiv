We are especially interested in how the availability of medication could change the necessary quarantine measures for effective control of the disease. We model the transmission by extending the SEIR model to include asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated and medicated population compartments. We calculate the basic reproduction number R_0 and show that for R_0<1 the disease dies out and for R_0>1 the disease is endemic. Using sensitivity analysis we establish that R_0 is most sensitive to the rates of quarantine and medication. We also study how the effectiveness and the rate of medication along with the quarantine rate affect R_0. We devise optimal quarantine, medication and isolation strategies, noting that availability of medication reduces the duration and severity of the lock-down needed for effective disease control. Our study also reinforces the idea that with the availability of medication, while the severity of the lock downs can be eased over time some social distancing protocols need to be observed, at least till a vaccine is found. We also analyze the COVID-109 outbreak data for four different countries, in two of these, India and Pakistan the curve is still rising, and in he other two, Italy and Spain, the epidemic curve is now falling due to effective quarantine measures. We provide estimates of R_0 and the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population for these countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohsin Ali","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences Lahore"},{"author_name":"Mudassar Imran","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science & Technology, Mishref, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Adnan Khan","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20117044","rel_title":"Predicting Growth of COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in Each U.S. County with a Population of 50,000 or More","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20117044","rel_abs":"A simple model of local spread of COVID-19 is needed to assist local governments and health care providers prepare for surges of clinical cases in their communities.

Methods We evaluated whether some specific post-mortem features are observed in these patients and if these changes are related to the presence of the virus in different organs. Complete macroscopic and microscopic autopsies were performed on different organs in 17 COVID-19 non-survivors. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung samples and with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in lung and other organs. Results Pulmonary findings revealed early-stage diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 15 out of 17 patients and microthrombi in small lung arteries in 11 patients. Late-stage DAD, atypical pneumocytes and\/or acute pneumonia were also observed. Four lung infarcts, two acute myocardial infarctions and one ischemic enteritis were observed. There was no evidence of myocarditis, hepatitis or encephalitis. Kidney evaluation revealed the presence of hemosiderin in tubules or pigmented casts in most patients. Spongiosis and vascular congestion were the most frequently encountered brain lesions. No specific SARS-CoV-2 lesions were observed in any organ. IHC revealed positive cells with a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs of 11 of the 17 (65%) patients; RT-PCR yielded a wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues, with 8 patients showing viral presence in all tested organs (i.e. lung, heart, spleen, liver, colon, kidney and brain). Conclusions In conclusion, autopsies revealed a great heterogeneity of COVID-19-related organ injury and the remarkable absence of any specific viral lesions, even when RT-PCR identified the presence of the virus in many organs.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Myriam Remmelink","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Ricardo De Mendoca","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Nicky D'Haene","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Sarah De Clercq","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Camille Verocq","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Lebrun","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Philomene Lavis","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Marie Lucie Racu","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Anne Laure Trepant","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Calliope Maris","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Rorive","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Olivier De Witte","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114447","rel_title":"Automated and partially-automated contact tracing: a rapid systematic review to inform the control of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114447","rel_abs":"Background Automated or partially-automated contact tracing tools are being deployed by many countries to contain SARS-CoV-2; however, the evidence base for their use is not well-established.

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, OVID Global Health, EBSCO COVID Portal, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv and Google Advanced for articles relevant to COVID-19, SARS, MERS, influenza or Ebola from 1\/1\/2000-14\/4\/2020. Two authors reviewed all full-text manuscripts. One reviewer extracted data using a pre-piloted form; a second independently verified extracted data. Primary outcomes were the number or proportion of contacts (and\/or subsequent cases) identified; secondary outcomes were indicators of outbreak control, app\/tool uptake, resource use, cost-effectiveness and lessons learnt. The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool or CHEERS checklist were used in quality assessment. Findings 4,033 citations were identified and 15 were included. No empirical evidence of automated contact tracing's effectiveness (regarding contacts identified or transmission reduction) was identified. Four of seven included modelling studies suggested that controlling COVID-19 requires high population uptake of automated contact-tracing apps (estimates from 56% to 95%), typically alongside other control measures. Studies of partially-automated contact tracing generally reported more complete contact identification and follow-up, and greater intervention timeliness (0.5-5 hours faster), than previous systems. No meta-analyses were possible. Interpretation Automated contact tracing has potential to reduce transmission with sufficient population uptake and usage. However, there is an urgent need for well-designed prospective evaluations as no studies provided empirical evidence of its effectiveness.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isobel Braithwaite","author_inst":"UCL Public Health Data Science Research Group, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Tom Callender","author_inst":"Department of Applied Health Research, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Miriam Bullock","author_inst":"UCL Collaborative Centre for Inclusion Health, University College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Robert W Aldridge","author_inst":"UCL Public Health Data Science Group, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Camille Verocq","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Lebrun","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Philomene Lavis","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Marie Lucie Racu","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Anne Laure Trepant","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Calliope Maris","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Rorive","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Olivier De Witte","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114280","rel_title":"Factors associated with country-variation in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality worldwide: an observational geographic study","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114280","rel_abs":"Background: The world is threatened by the outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) since December 2019. The number of cases and deaths increased dramatically in some countries from March 2020. The objective of our study was to examine potential associated factors with country-variation in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the world. Methods: We performed a retrospective geographic study including all countries with the most recent available data on free access on the web. We analyzed univariate and multivariable correlation between both the number of reported cases and deaths by country and demographic, socioeconomic characteristics, lockdown as major control measure, average annual temperature and relative humidity. We performed simple linear regression, independent t test and ANOVA test for univariate analyses and negative binomial regression model for multivariable analyses. Results: We analyzed data of 186 countries from all world regions. As of 13th April 2020, a total of 1 804 302 COVID-19 cases and 113 444 deaths were reported. The reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by countries was associated with the number of days between the first case and lockdown, the number of cases at lockdown, life expectancy at birth, average annual temperature and the socio-economic level. Countries which never implemented BCG vaccination reported higher mortality than others. Conclusions: The pandemic is still ongoing and poses a global health threat as there is no effective antiviral treatment or vaccines. Thus, timing of control measure implementation is a crucial factor in determining the spread of the epidemic. It should be a lesson for this pandemic and for the future.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hedia Bellali","author_inst":"Tunis El Manar University"},{"author_name":"Neila Chtioui","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Statistics department, A Mami Hospital, Ariana"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Chahed","author_inst":"Medical Faculty of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Robert W Aldridge","author_inst":"UCL Public Health Data Science Group, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Camille Verocq","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Lebrun","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Philomene Lavis","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Marie Lucie Racu","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Anne Laure Trepant","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Calliope Maris","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Rorive","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Olivier De Witte","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114140","rel_title":"Mental health outcomes and associations during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey of the US general population","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114140","rel_abs":"Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to significant mental health stresses, potentially with modifiable risk factors. To determine the presence of and magnitude of associations between baseline associations and anxiety and depression in the US general population, we performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race- stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 45 (16), and 494 (48.8%) were male. Baseline demographic data were similar between those that were (n=663, 66.2%) and were not (n=339, 33.8%) under a shelter in place\/ stay at home order, with the exception of sex and geographic location. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%) meeting clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.49, 0.87]) and living in a larger home (OR 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting anxiety criteria.

We evaluated the performance of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infection compared to RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab alone in patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 324 consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital. All hospitalized patients who had RT-PCR testing and HRCT were included in the study. HRCTs were classified as Category 1, 2 or 3. Patients were then divided into four groups based on HRCT category and RT-PCR swab results for analysis. Results: The average age of patients was 59.4 (+15.2) years and 123 (38.9%) were female. Predominant ethnicity was African American 148 (46.11%). 161 patients tested positive by RT-PCR, while 41 tested positive by HRCT. 167 (52.02%) had category 1 scan, 63 (19.63%) had category 2 scan and 91 (28.35%) had category 3 HRCT scans. There was substantial agreement between our radiologists for HRCT classification ({kappa} = 0.64). Sensitivity and specificity of HRCT classification system was 77.6 and 73.7 respectively. Ferritin, LDH, AST and ALT were higher in Group 1 and D-dimers levels was higher in Group 3; differences however were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Due to its high infectivity and asymptomatic transmission, until a highly sensitive and specific COVID-19 test is developed, HRCT should be incorporated into the assessment of patients who are hospitalized with suspected COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maulin Patel","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junad Chowdhury","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zheng","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Osheen Abramian","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven Verga","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Zhao","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Montecalvo","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gary Cohen","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maruti Kumaran","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandra Dass","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114033","rel_title":"Continuous Electroencephalography (cEEG) Characteristics and Acute Symptomatic Seizures in COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114033","rel_abs":"Background: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have only recently been described, with a paucity of literature reporting the potential relationship between COVID-19 and acute symptomatic seizures. Two prior studies found no clinical or electrographic seizures in their cohorts of COVID-19 patients with altered mental status (AMS) and clinical seizure-like events (SLEs). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 22 critically-ill COVID-19 patients above the age of 18 years who underwent EEG (electroencephalography) monitoring between April 20th, 2020 and May 20th, 2020 were studied. 19 patients underwent continuous EEG (cEEG) for at least 24 hours, and 3 patients underwent routine EEGs (<1 hour). Demographics including age, gender, comorbid medical, and neurological conditions were collected. Clinical variables included EEG findings, anti-seizure medications, discharge disposition, and survival. Findings: 17 patients underwent EEG monitoring for unexplained altered mental status changes and 5 patients underwent monitoring for a seizure-like event. 5 patients had epileptiform abnormalities on EEG (4 patients on cEEG, 1 on routine EEG); and only 2 of 5 epileptic EEG patients had a prior history of epilepsy. 2 patients in our cohort had electrographic seizures in the absence of prior epilepsy history. No patients with epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures had acutely abnormal neuroimaging on CT or MRI. Interpretation: Encephalopathic COVID-19 positive patients had a range of EEG abnormalities, and a higher proportion of patients in this series had electrographic seizures than previous literature suggests. This may be influenced by the duration of monitoring with cEEG and the use of a 21 channel electrode system. cEEG findings may help to guide antiseizure medical therapy, as well as the workup of altered mental status in the setting of unremarkable neuroimaging. Funding: No funding was used for this study.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shreya Louis","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew Dhawan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Christopher Newey","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Dileep Nair","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Lara Jehi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hantus","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vineet Punia","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Montecalvo","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gary Cohen","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maruti Kumaran","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandra Dass","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20111542","rel_title":"Ambient air pollutants, meteorological factors and their interactions affect confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20111542","rel_abs":"Emerging evidences have confirmed effects of meteorological factors on novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We created three vulnerability indices to identify areas and people who require greater support while elucidating health inequities to inform emergency response in Kenya. Methods: Geospatial indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices; social (SVI), epidemiological (EVI) and a composite of the two (SEVI) resolved at 295 sub-counties in Kenya. SVI included nineteen indicators that affect the spread of disease; socio-economic inequities, access to services and population dynamics while EVI comprised five indicators describing comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severe disease progression. The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale, spatially overlaid via arithmetic mean and equally weighted. The indices were classified into seven classes, 1-2 denoted low-vulnerability and 6-7 high-vulnerability. The population within vulnerabilities classes was quantified. Results: The spatial variation of each index was heterogeneous across Kenya. Forty-nine north-western and partly eastern sub-counties (6.9 m people) were highly vulnerable while 58 sub-counties (9.7 m people) in western and central Kenya were the least vulnerable for SVI. For EVI, 48 sub-counties (7.2 m people) in central and the adjacent areas and 81 sub-counties (13.2 m people) in northern Kenya were the most and least vulnerable respectively. Overall (SEVI), 46 sub-counties (7.0 m people) around central and south-eastern were more vulnerable while 81 sub-counties (14.4 m people) that were least vulnerable. Conclusion: The vulnerability indices created are tools relevant to the county, national government and stakeholders for prioritization and improved planning especially in highly vulnerable sub-counties where cases have not been confirmed. The heterogeneous nature of the vulnerability highlights the need to address social determinants of health disparities, strengthen the health system and establish programmes to cushion against the negative effects of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter M Macharia","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Noel K Joseph","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emelda A Okiro","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Sybil Klaus","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Lara Jehi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hantus","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vineet Punia","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"David Fleece","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Montecalvo","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gary Cohen","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maruti Kumaran","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandra Dass","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114330","rel_title":"Safety Stock: Predicting demand on the supply chain in Brazilian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114330","rel_abs":"Background: Many challenges lie ahead for COVID-19, not only related to the acceleration of the pandemic, but also to the prediction of the hospital's personal protective equipment to accommodate the explosive demand. Due to the situation of uncertainty, the hospital administration encourages the excess stock of these materials, causing excess products in some hospitals, but shortages in others. Although three main factors limit the number of patients seen at a hospital: the number of beds available, the number of equipment, and, above all, the number of health professionals available at the hospital, per shift. Objective: In this scenario, a challenge is to build an easy-to-use computational tool to predict the demand for personal protective equipment in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, with updating in real-time. Methods: We propose naive statistical modeling, which combines historical data on the consumption of personal protective equipment by hospitals, current protocols for their uses and epidemiological data related to the disease, in order to build predictive models for the demand for personal protective equipment in Brazilian hospitals during the pandemic. We then embed our modeling in a tool that can provide the safety stock for a particular hospital. Results: Our tool presents forecasts of consumption\/demand for personal protective equipment over time, indicating the moment when the hospital reaches maximum consumption, the estimate of how long it will work in this state, and when it will leave it. Conclusion: With our forecasting, a hospital may have estimated, based on its stock levels and possible new purchases, its needs related to a specific personal protective equipment, which allows for the adoption of strategies to control and keep the stock at safety levels to the demand. As a direct consequence, it enables interchange and cooperation between hospitals, aiming to maximize the care during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oilson Alberto Gonzatto Jr.","author_inst":"UFSCar-ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Diego Carvalho do Nascimento","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Cibele Maria Russo","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Marcos Jardel Henriques","author_inst":"UFSCar-ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Caio Paziani Tomazella","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Maristela Oliveira Santos","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Denis Neves","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Diego Assad","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Guerra","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Keise Bertazo","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Jose Alberto Cuminato","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Francisco Louzada","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114017","rel_title":"Modelling the SARS-CoV-2 first epidemic wave in Greece: social contact patterns and impact assessment of social distancing interventions.","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114017","rel_abs":"In Greece, a nationwide lockdown to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was imposed on March 23, 2020. As by the end of April the first epidemic wave is waning, it is important to assess the infection attack rate and quantify the impact of physical distancing. We implemented a survey to assess social mixing patterns before the epidemic and during lockdown. We estimated R0 from surveillance data and assessed its decline as a result of physical distancing based on social contacts data. We applied a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model to estimate the infection attack rate and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). As multiple social distancing measures were implemented simultaneously (schools\/work\/leisure), we assessed their overall impact as well as their relative contribution. R0 was estimated 2.38 (95%CI: 2.01,2.80). By April 26th, the infection attack rate was 0.12% (95% CrI: 0.06%,0.26%) and the IFR 1.12% (95% CrI: 0.55%,2.31%). During lockdown, daily contacts were reduced by 86.9% and the effective reproduction number reached 0.46 (95% CrI: 0.35,0.57). The reduction in R0 attributed to lockdown was 81.0% (95% CrI: 71.8%,86.0%) whereas the reduction attributed to each measure separately ranged between 10%-24%. We assessed scenarios with less disruptive social distancing measures as well as scenarios where measures are partially lifted after lockdown. This is the first impact assessment of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in a European country. It suggests that only multiple measures implemented simultaneously could reduce R0 below 1. Measuring social mixing patterns can be a tool for real-time monitoring of the epidemic potential.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vana Sypsa","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Roussos","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Paraskevis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theodore Lytras","author_inst":"National Public Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Angelos Hatzakis","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Denis Neves","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Diego Assad","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Guerra","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Keise Bertazo","author_inst":"Bionexo"},{"author_name":"Jose Alberto Cuminato","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Francisco Louzada","author_inst":"ICMC-USP"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Peluso","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean Louis Vincent","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Christine Decaestecker","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Fabio Silvio Taccone","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Salmon","author_inst":"CUB ULB Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Marina Caskey","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114124","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among children visiting a hospital during the initial Seattle outbreak","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114124","rel_abs":"Children are strikingly underrepresented in COVID-19 case counts.

In-hospital mortality was defined as the endpoint. Sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed. Results: 18,506 patients were included in this meta-analysis (3,713 diabetics and 14,793 non-diabetics). Patients with diabetes were associated with a higher risk of death compared to patients without diabetes (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.35, 1.96; I2 77.4%). The heterogeneity was high. A study level meta-regression analysis was performed for all the important covariates and no significant interactions were found between the covariates and the outcome of mortality.

Further studies are needed to assess whether this association is independent or not, as well as to investigate to role of glucose control prior or during the disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonidas Palaiodimos","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Natalia Chamorro-Pareja","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Karamanis","author_inst":"University of Piraeus"},{"author_name":"Weijia Li","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Phaedon D Zavras","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Mathias","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Damianos G Kokkinidis","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexandra C Walls","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washingon"},{"author_name":"Michael Murphy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lauren Carter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xuan Qin","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jane A Dickerson","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Davide Robbiani","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114074","rel_title":"On the true numbers of COVID-19 infections: behind the available data","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114074","rel_abs":"In December-2019 China reported several cases of a novel coronavirus later called COVID-19.

The most important result of the model was the identification and segregation of pandemic characteristics into two distinct groups: those that are invariant across countries, and those that are highly variable. Amongst the former is the infective period T_L, which was very similar for all countries, with a mean value E(T_L) = 15.5 +\/- 0.6 days. The other invariants were T_R, the average time between contacts and R = N_C, the average number of contacts while infective with mean values E(T_R) = 3.5 +\/- 0.2 days E(N_C) = E(R) = 4.46+\/- 0.17. In contrast to these invariants, there was a highly variable time lag T_D between the peak in the daily number of infected individuals and the peak in the daily number of deaths, ranging from a low of T_D= 4 days for Italy and Denmark, to a high of T_D= 17 for Norway. The mortality probability among identified cases was also highly variable, ranging from low values 3.5%, 5% and 5% for Norway, Denmark and Germany respectively to high values of 18%, 18% and 20% for France, Sweden and the UK respectively. Our analysis predicts that the number of deaths per million population until the pandemic ends (defined as when the daily number of deaths is less than 5) will be lowest for Norway (45 deaths\/million) and highest for the United Kingdom (628 deaths\/million). Finally, we observe a small but detectable effect of average temperature on the probability  of infection in each contact, with higher temperatures associated with lower infectivity.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gyan Bhanot","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Charles DeLisi","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Yassine Hassouni","author_inst":"ESMaR, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University, Av.

Modern high-throughput sequencing technology has led to the deposition of vast numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in curated repositories, which have been useful in mapping the spread of the virus around the globe. They also provide a unique opportunity to observe virus evolution in real time. Here, we evaluate two cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify rapidly emerging variants within structured cis-regulatory elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, twenty variants are present at a minor allele frequency of at least 0.5%. Several enhance the stability of Stem Loop 1 in the 5UTR, including a set of co-occurring variants that extend its length. One appears to modulate the stability of the frameshifting pseudoknot between ORF1a and ORF1b, and another perturbs a bi-stable molecular switch in the 3UTR. Finally, five variants destabilize structured elements within the 3UTR hypervariable region, including the S2M stem loop, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in viral replication. Two of the most abundant variants appear to be caused by RNA editing, suggesting host-viral defense contributes to SARS-CoV-2 genome heterogeneity. This analysis has implications for the development of therapeutics that target viral cis-regulatory RNA structures or sequences, as rapidly emerging variations in these regions could lead to drug resistance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean P.

Rapid sequencing and publication of consensus genomes have enabled phylogenetic analysis of the virus, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 evolves relatively slowly1, but with multiple sites in the genome that appear inconsistent with the overall consensus phylogeny2. To understand these discrepancies, we used veSEQ3, a targeted RNA-seq approach, to quantify minor allele frequencies in 413 clinical samples from two UK locations. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterised by extensive within-host diversity, which is frequently shared among infected individuals with patterns consistent with geographical structure. These results were reproducible in data from two other sequencing locations in the UK, where we find evidence of mixed infection by major circulating lineages with patterns that cannot readily be explained by artefacts in the data. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 diversity is transmissible, and propose that geographic patterns are generated by transient co-circulation of distinct viral populations. Co-transmission of mixed populations could open opportunities for resolving clusters of transmission and understanding pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katrina A Lythgoe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew David Hall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mariateresa de Cesare","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"George MacIntyre-Cockett","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amy Trebes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Newton Otecko","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emma L Wise","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Nathan Moore","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jessica Lynch","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Matilde Mori","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Anita Justice","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Angie Green","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"M Azim Ansari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-Dorner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Catrin E Moore","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tim E.A.

Grim public health statistics highlight the need for vaccines that can rapidly confer protection after a single dose and be manufactured using components suitable for scale-up and efficient distribution. In response, we have rapidly developed repRNA-CoV2S, a stable and highly immunogenic vaccine candidate comprised of an RNA replicon formulated with a novel Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION) designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery and immunogenicity. We show that intramuscular injection of LION\/repRNA-CoV2S elicits robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a Type 1 T helper response as well as potent T cell responses in mice. Importantly, a single-dose administration in nonhuman primates elicited antibody responses that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2. These data support further development of LION\/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesse H Erasmus","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amit P Khandhar","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Alexandra C Walls","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Emily A Hemann","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patience Murapa","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jacob Archer","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shanna Leventhal","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jim Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kevin E Draves","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samantha Randall","author_inst":"PAI Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kathryn A Guerriero","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Malcolm S Duthie","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Darrick Carter","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Steven G Reed","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"David W Hawman","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Berglund","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Deborah Heydenburg Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Buck","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John A Todd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tanya Golubchik","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.118190","rel_title":"Comparison of the NeuMoDX, Diasorin Simplexa, Cepheid and Roche CDC SARS-CoV 2 EUA assays using nasopharyngeal\/nasal swabs in universal transport media (UTM) and sputum and tracheal aspirates","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.118190","rel_abs":"In March 2019 the outbreak of SARS-CoV 2 was officially defined as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and shortly after, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) molecular testing for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from NP swabs. Since then, EUA with relaxed regulations were granted to numerous manufacturers and clinical microbiology laboratories to implement in-house testing assays with nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and subsequently additional specimen types. Because of supply chain shortages leading to competition for reagents, sustaining any significant volume of testing soon became problematic. As a countermeasure, within several weeks the Henry Ford Microbiology Laboratory validated 4 different rtPCR assays and multiple specimen types using NeuMoDX, Diasorin Simplexa, Cepheid and Roche platforms. The purpose of this study was to analyze the analytic sensitivity of these rtPCR assays with NP\/nasal swabs and sputum\/tracheal aspirates. Qualitative analytic agreement between the 4 platforms for NP\/nasal swabs ranged 95% - 100% overall with no statistically significant difference in threshold cT values. Similar results were obtained with the sputum\/tracheal aspirates. These data demonstrate the high accuracy and reproducibility in detection of SARS-CoV 2 between the rtPCR assays performed on 4 different platforms with numerous specimen types.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert J Tibbetts","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Kathy Callahan","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Kareem Rofoo","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Richard J Zarbo","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Linoj Philip Samuel","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Jacob Archer","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shanna Leventhal","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jim Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kevin E Draves","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samantha Randall","author_inst":"PAI Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kathryn A Guerriero","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Malcolm S Duthie","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Darrick Carter","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Steven G Reed","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"David W Hawman","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Berglund","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Deborah Heydenburg Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Buck","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John A Todd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tanya Golubchik","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.120709","rel_title":"\"Monoclonal-type\" plastic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 based on Molecularly Imprinted Polymers","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.120709","rel_abs":"Summary of the ideaOur idea is focused on the development of \u201cmonoclonal-type\u201d plastic antibodies based on Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) able to selectively bind a portion of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to block its function and, thus, the infection process. Molecular Imprinting, indeed, represents a very promising and attractive technology for the synthesis of MIPs characterized by specific recognition abilities for a target molecule. Given these characteristics, MIPs can be considered tailor-made synthetic antibodies obtained by a templating process.In the present study, the developed imprinted polymeric nanoparticles were characterized in terms of particles size and distribution by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and the imprinting effect and selectivity were investigated by performing binding experiments using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the novel coronavirus and the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein, respectively. Finally, the hemocompatibility of the prepared MIP-based plastic antibodies was also evaluated.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Puoci","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Ortensia Ilaria Parisi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Marco Dattilo","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Francesco Patitucci","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Rocco Malivindi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Pezzi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Ida Perrotta","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Ecology and Earth Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Mariarosa Ruffo","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy. - Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health"},{"author_name":"Fabio Amone","author_inst":"Macrofarm s.r.l., c\/o Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutrition Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036 Rende (CS), Italy."},{"author_name":"Kevin E Draves","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samantha Randall","author_inst":"PAI Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kathryn A Guerriero","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Malcolm S Duthie","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Darrick Carter","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Steven G Reed","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"David W Hawman","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Berglund","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Deborah Heydenburg Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Buck","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John A Todd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tanya Golubchik","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"synthetic biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.120204","rel_title":"Optimizing high-yield production of SARS-CoV-2 soluble spike trimers for serology assays","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.120204","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer is the primary antigen for several serology assays critical to determining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the population. Until stable cell lines are developed to increase the titer of this secreted protein in mammalian cell culture, the low yield of spike protein produced from transient transfection of HEK293 cells will be a limiting factor for these assays. To improve the yield of spike protein and support the high demand for antigens in serology assays, we investigated several recombinant protein expression variables by altering the incubation temperature, harvest time, chromatography strategy, and final protein manipulation. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently yields 5 mg of protein per liter of expression culture for two commonly used forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We show that these proteins form well-behaved stable trimers and are consistently functional in serology assays across multiple protein production lots.\n\nHighlightsO_LIImproved yields of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through modification of expression and purification parameters\nC_LIO_LIYields of greater than 5 mg\/l obtained for VRC spike under optimal conditions\nC_LIO_LISpike protein quality was validated by QC methods to ensure utility in serology assays\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Mehalko","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew Drew","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kelly Snead","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Wall","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Troy Taylor","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Peter Frank","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"John-Paul Denson","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Min Hong","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Gulcin Gulten","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Simon Messing","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"William Gillette","author_inst":"Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Darrick Carter","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Steven G Reed","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"David W Hawman","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Berglund","author_inst":"HDT Bio Corp"},{"author_name":"Deborah Heydenburg Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Buck","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John A Todd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tanya Golubchik","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.120667","rel_title":"Evaluation of commercial qPCR kits for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pooled samples","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.120667","rel_abs":"Due to the current pandemic, global shortage of reagents has drawn interest in developing alternatives to increase the number coronavirus tests.
