This has hampered the ability to ascertain true infection numbers, evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance strategies, determine transmission dynamics, and estimate reproductive numbers. Leveraging both viral genomic and time series case data offers methods to estimate these parameters. Using a Bayesian inference framework to fit a branching process model to viral phylogeny and time series case data, we estimated time-varying reproductive numbers and their variance, the total numbers of infected individuals, the probability of case detection over time, and the estimated time to detection of an outbreak for 12 locations in Europe, China, and the United States. The median percentage of undetected infections ranged from 13% in New York to 92% in Shanghai, China, with the length of local transmission prior to two cases being detected ranging from 11 days (95% CI: 4-21) in California to 37 days (9-100) in Minnesota. The probability of detection was as low as 1% at the start of local epidemics, increasing as the number of reported cases increased exponentially. The precision of estimates increased with the number of full-length viral genomes in a location. The viral phylogeny was informative of the variance in the reproductive number with the 32% most infectious individuals contributing 80% of total transmission events. This is the first study that incorporates both the viral genomes and time series case data in the estimation of undetected COVID-19 infections. Our findings suggest the presence of undetected infections broadly and that superspreading events are contributing less to observed dynamics than during the SARS epidemic in 2003. This genomics-informed modeling approach could estimate in near real-time critical surveillance metrics to inform ongoing COVID-19 response efforts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucy M Li","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ayscue","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092155","rel_title":"A Divide and Conquer Strategy against the Covid-19 Pandemic?!","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092155","rel_abs":"The concern about (socio-)economic consequences of collective lockdowns in the Covid-19 pandemic calls for alternative strategies. We consider a divide and conquer strategy in which a high risk group (HRG) is put on strict isolation, whereas the remainder of the population is exposed to the virus, building up immunity against Covid-19. The question is whether this strategy may suppress the effective reproduction number below the critical value of R_eff < 1 without further lockdown once the HRG is released from isolation. While this proposal appears already rather academic, we show that R_eff < 1 can only be obtained provided that the HRG is less than ~20-30% of the total population. Hence, this strategy is likely to fail in countries with a HRG larger than the given upper bound. In addition, we argue that the maximum infection rate occurring in this strategy is likely to exceed realistic capacities of most health care systems. While the conclusion is rather negative in this regard, we emphasise that the strategy of stopping the curve at an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic has a chance to work out. The required duration of the lockdown is estimated to be {tau} ~ 14 days\/(1-R_eff) (up to some order one factor) for R_eff < 1, provided a systematic tracing strategy of new infections exists for the subsequent relaxation phase. In this context we also argue why R_eff remains the crucial parameter which needs to be accurately monitored and controlled.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick S.

Using the UK as a case study, we construct a stochastic branching process model for the virus transmission, embedded on a network interaction model encoding mobility patterns in the UK. The network model is based on commuter data from the 2011 census, a catchment area model for schools, and a phenomenological model for mobility and interactions outside of work, school, and the home. We show that for outbreak scenarios where contact-tracing and moderate social distancing alone provide suppression but do not contain the spread, targeted lockdowns or mass-testing interventions at the level of individual communities (with just a few thousand inhabitants) can be effective at containing outbreaks. For spatially targeted mass-testing, a moderate increase in testing capacity would be required (typically < 40000 additional tests per day), while for local lockdowns we find that only a small fraction (typically < 0.1%) of the population needs to be locked down at any one time (assuming that one third of transmission occurs in the home, at work or school, and out in the wider community respectively). The efficacy of spatially targeted interventions is contingent on an appreciable fraction of transmission events occurring within (relative to across) communities. Confirming the efficacy of community-level interventions therefore calls for detailed investigation of spatial transmission patterns for SARS-CoV-2, accounting for sub-community-scale transmission dynamics, and changes in mobility patterns due to the presence of other containment measures (such as social distancing and travel restrictions).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin Alsing","author_inst":"Oskar Klein Centre, Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Nairi Usher","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Philip JD Crowley","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092262","rel_title":"Impact of essential workers in the context of social distancing for epidemic control","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092262","rel_abs":"Many governments have responded to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by imposing social policies that restrict interactions outside of the home, resulting in a large fraction of the workforce either working from home or not working.

To explore how interactions among such \"essential\" workers, and between essential workers and the rest of the population, impact disease risk and the effectiveness of pandemic control, we evaluated several models of essential worker interactions within a standard epidemiology framework. The models were designed to correspond to key characteristics of, respectively, cashiers, factory employees, and healthcare workers. We find in all three models that essential workers are at substantially elevated risk of infection compared to the rest of the population, and that increasing the numbers of essential workers necessitates the imposition of more stringent interaction controls on the rest of the population in order to manage the pandemic. However, different archetypes of essential workers differ in both their individual probability of infection and impact on the broader pandemic, highlighting the need to understand and target for intervention the specific risks faced by different groups of essential workers.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William R Milligan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Zachary L Fuller","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ipsita Agarwal","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael B Eisen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Molly Przeworski","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Guy Sella","author_inst":"Columbia University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092304","rel_title":"On the impact of early non-pharmaceutical interventions as containment strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092304","rel_abs":"Background The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has spread since then to around 210 countries and territories by April 2020. Consequently, countries have adopted physical distance measures in an attempt to mitigate the uncontrolled spread of the virus. A critical question for policymakers to inform evidence-based practice is if and how physical distance measures slowed the propagation of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic. Methods This study aims to quantify the effects of physical distance mitigation measures on the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from John Hopkins University on confirmed cases and testing data from the Our World in Data were used in an interrupted time series analysis to estimate the effects of physical distance measures on the growth rates of the pandemic in 12 countries of Asia, Africa, and Europe. Findings We found that physical distance measures produced a significant decrease in the growth rates of the COVID-19 pandemic in five countries (Austria, Belgium, Italy, Malaysia, and South Korea). The test-positivity rate was significant in understanding the slowing growth rate of COVID-19 cases caused by the mitigation measures, as it provides important context that is missing from analysis based only on confirmed case data. Interpretation Physical distance interventions effectively slowed the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study could inform infectious disease mitigation policies based on physical distance measures by quantifying the differential health outcomes of a pandemic with and without physical distance interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andres Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Esteban Correa-Agudelo","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Hana Kim","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Adam J Branscum","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"F.

While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. Preliminary findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. In particular, large decreases in the amount of social activity through family (58%), friends\/neighbors (44.9%) or entertainment (46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower satisfaction (-30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, social contact score through digital technologies has significantly increased (p<0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology. Conclusion These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period. Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through technology-based solution is urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ACHRAF AMMAR","author_inst":"Otto-Von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Boukhris","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

This work aims to develop valid instruments to evaluate COVID-19 induced anxiety, protective behaviors, and knowledge towards COVID-19, and to explore the relationship between the three constructs. Methods: A total sample of 215 university students were recruited to participate in an online self-administered questionnaire. The e-survey consisted of three instruments: COVID-19 Induced Anxiety Scale (CIAS) with 10 items, Protective Behaviors towards COVID-19 Scale (PBCS) with 14 items, and COVID-19 Related Knowledge Scale (CRKS) with 12 items. Results: Item-total analysis and CFA models indicated that CIAS items no. 1, 2, 5, and 8 should be removed to achieve adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.78) and structural validity. The protective behaviors towards COVID-19 can be estimated from 3 dimensions: Routine Protective Behaviors (RPB), Post-exposure Protective Behaviors (PPB), and Post-exposure Risky Behaviors (PRB). Meanwhile, PBCS showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.85). Although the sample was unbalanced on gender, gender explained 5% of the variance in protective behaviors with females being more inclined to engage in protective behaviors. Structural Equation Model (SEM) implied that an individual's COVID-19 related knowledge was associated with the three dimensions of protective behaviors (RPB, PPB, and PRB) positively. However, the level of COVID-19 induced anxiety was linked to RPB and PPB positively but negatively to PRB. Conclusion: The 6-item version of CIAS and the 14-item version of PBCS are promising tools for measuring COVID-19 induced anxiety and protective behaviors and can be adopted for future use during early phases of communicable diseases outbreaks. Knowledge is a key indicator for protective behavior; therefore, awareness strategies need to suppress infodemic impact. Severe stress must be monitored during early phases of outbreaks as it significantly increases the probability of risk behavior engagement.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abanoub Riad","author_inst":"Masaryk University"},{"author_name":"Yi Huang","author_inst":"Masaryk University"},{"author_name":"Liping Zheng","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Steriani Elavsky","author_inst":"Masaryk University"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

Methods We reported 135 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan, China. Demographic data, medical history, and laboratory parameters were taken from inpatient records and compared between patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU isolation wards for prognosis on disease severity. In particular, survivors and non-survivors upon ICU admission were compared for prognosis on disease mortality. Results For COVID-19 patients, blood test results showed more significantly deranged values in the ICU group than those in non-ICU. Among those parameters for ICU patients, myocardial variables including troponin T, creatine kinase isoenzymes, myoglobin, were found significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. Conclusions Upon hospitalization abnormal myocardial metabolism in COVID-19 patients could be prognostic indicators of a worsened outcome for disease severity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianguo Zhang","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, and The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Daoyin Ding","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Can Cao","author_inst":"The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Zhang","author_inst":"The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Xing Huang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development, and if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised in the context of other coronaviruses. CpG suppression amongst coronaviruses does not significantly differ according to genera of virus, but does vary according to host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. While ORF10 is only present in the genomes of a subset of coronaviruses, E is essential for virus replication. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. Phylogeny indicates that this is an ancestrally-derived trait reflecting their origin in bats, rather than something selected for after zoonotic transfer. Conservation of CpG motifs in these regions suggests that they have a functionality which over-rides the need to suppress CpG; an observation relevant to future strategies towards a rationally attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Digard","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Hui-Min Lee","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Colin Sharp","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Finn Grey","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Eleanor R Gaunt","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular surface cells possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry\/infection.Methods We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2.Results Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. Surgical conjunctival specimens also showed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctival epithelium, especially prominent in the superficial epithelium, as well as the substantia propria. All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2. Finally, western blot analysis of protein lysates from human corneal epithelium obtained during refractive surgery confirmed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.Conclusions Together, these results indicate that ocular surface cells including conjunctiva are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and could therefore serve as a portal of entry as well as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission of this virus. This highlights the importance of safety practices including face masks and ocular contact precautions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lingli Zhou","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhenhua Xu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gianni M Castiglione","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Uri S Soiberman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles G Eberhart","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elia J Duh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

The World Health Organization declares the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 30th of January, and a pandemic on the 11th of March. On the 4th of March, the Italian government orders the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide.The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, practice and attitudes (KAP) of secondary school at the time of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In this cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted among the high school student population with age ranging from 14 to 19 years old, a questionnaire with 19 items regarding the KAP toward COVID-19 is asked. Study participants are recruited from several secondary schools of different areas. Frequencies and histograms are computed for descriptive purposes. Statistical analysis is computed with Chi square test, utilized to depict relevant difference between geender. Among a total of 2380 students who answers the questionnaire, 40.7% are male and 59.3% are female.Level of knowledge about generical characteristics of COVID-19 is quite similar among gender. Students present a good level of knowledge about the clinical presentation of the disease, the basic hygiene principles, the modes of transmission and the method of protection against virus transmission. The knowledge about number of this pandemia and easy scientific correlation with COVID-19 is quite confused. The most frequently reported source of knowledge about COVID-19 is television, whereas the less is the school. Our findings suggest that student population shows appropriate practice, and positive attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak.More emphasis should be placed on education of the student partecipants about biological meaning of this infection and relative preventive or future measures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"La Sapienza, Roma"},{"author_name":"Dafni Souli","author_inst":"Istituto Cine-tv Rossellini, Rome"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Rowan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heather Kulaga","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Hillel","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

Free energy of spread on a given day is defined equal to the natural logarithm of the number of infected cases. Dissipation of propagation is obtained using a postulated form of free energy built using thermodynamics of irreversible processes in analogy to isotherm wave propagation in solids and elastic damage behaviour of materials. The proposed expression of daily free energy rate leads to dissipation of propagation introducing a parameter quantifying measures taking by governments to restrict transmission. Entropy daily rate representing disorder produced in the initial system is also explicitly defined. In this context, a simple law of evolution of infected cases as function of time is given in an iterative form. The model predicts different effects on peak of infected cases Imax and epidemic period, including effects of population size N, effects of measures taking to restrict spread, effects of population density and effect of a parameter T similar to absolute temperature in thermodynamics. Different effects are presented first. The model is than applied to epidemic spread in Tunisia and compared with data registered since the report of the first confirmed case on Mar 2, 2020. It is shown that the low epidemic size in Tunisia is essentially due to a low population density and relatively strict restriction measures including lockdown and quarantine.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oualid Limam","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, ENIT"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Limam","author_inst":"Laboratory of medical biology, Regional Hospital of Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Rowan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heather Kulaga","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Hillel","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

To confront the epidemic, a simple S I R model is used to simulate the number of affected patients of Coronavirus disease in Romania and Pakistan. The model captures the growth in case onsets and the estimated results are almost compatible with the actual reported cases. Through the calibration of parameters, forecast for the appearance of new cases in Romania and Pakistan is reported till the end of this year by analysing the current situation.

This study is to test the hypothesis that environmental surfaces played important roles in transmission for SARS-CoV-2 during this outbreak. Methods We sampled environmental surfaces including air from common areas in the cruise ship and cabins in which confirmed COVID-19 cases and non-cases had stayed after they left the cabins. We tested the samples for SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR and conducted viral isolation. Findings Of 601 samples tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 58 samples (10%) from case-cabins from which they left 1-17 days before sampling, but not from non-case-cabins. Except for one sample from an air hood in a corridor, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from samples in common areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from all 14 air samples. RNA was most often detected on the floor around toilet in the bathroom (39%, 13\/33, cycle quantification (Cq): 26.21-37.62) and bed pillow (34%, 11\/32, Cq: 34.61-38.99). There was no difference in the detection proportion between cabins for symptomatic (15%, 28\/189, Cq: 29.79-38.86) and asymptomatic cases (21%, 28\/131, Cq: 26.21-38.99). No SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from any of the samples. Interpretation The environment around the COVID-19 cases was extensively contaminated from SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19 outbreak in the cruise ship. Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients seems to be similar and the environmental surface could involve viral transmission through direct contact.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taskforce for the COVID-19 Cruise Ship Outbreak","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Mureed Hussain","author_inst":"Higher Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Aziz Ullah Awan","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of the Punjab, New Campus, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Dumitru Baleanu","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Cankaya University, 06530 Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

Using country-level data, we modeled the early growth in the number of cases for over 480 cities in all Brazilian states. As the main findings, we found that the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols was the main explanatory factor for the observed growth rate of COVID-19. Those cities that presented the highest spread of the new coronavirus were also those that had lower averages of social distancing. We also underline that total population of cities and connectivity, represented by the city-level importance to the air transportation of people across the country, plays important roles in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Climate and socioeconomic predictors had little contribution to the big-picture scenario. Our results show that different States had high variability in their growth rates, mostly due to quite different public health strategies to retain the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of all limitations of such a large-scale approach, our results underline that climatic conditions are likely weak limiting factors for the spread of the new coronavirus, and the circulation of people in the city- and country-level are the most responsible factors for the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. Moreover, we reinforce that social distancing protocols are fundamental to avoid critical scenarios and the collapse of healthcare systems. We also predict that economic-induced decisions for relaxing social distancing might have catastrophic consequences, especially in large cities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matheus T Baumgartner","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Maringa"},{"author_name":"Fernando M Lansac-Toha","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Maringa"},{"author_name":"Marco Tulio P Coelho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Dobrovolski","author_inst":"Universidade Federal da Bahia"},{"author_name":"Jose Alexandre F Diniz-Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

We examined the following COVID-19 outcomes within federal penitentiaries and contrasted them with the overall population in the penitentiaries' respective provincial jurisdictions: testing, prevalence, the proportion recovered, and fatality. Methods: Data for prisons were obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada and, for the general population, from COVID-19 Esri Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub. Data were retrieved between March 30 and April 21, 2020, and are accurate to this date. Penitentiary-, province- and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated. Results: Data on 50 of 51 penitentiaries (98%) were available. Of these, 72% of penitentiaries reported fewer tests per 1000 population than the Canadian general population average (16 tests\/1000 population), and 24% of penitentiaries reported zero tests. Penitentiaries with high levels of testing were those that already had elevated COVID-19 prevalence. Five penitentiaries reported an outbreak (at least one case). Hardest hit penitentiaries were those in Quebec and British Columbia, with some prisons reporting COVID-19 prevalence of 30% to 40%. Of these, two were women's prisons. Female prisoners were over-represented among cases (31% of cases overall, despite representing 5% of the total prison population). Conclusion: Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate given the confined nature of prison populations. This, along with rigorous infection prevention control practices and the potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb current outbreaks and those likely to come.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Blair","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Abtin Parnia","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Arjumand Siddiqi","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada;  Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, C"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Dobrovolski","author_inst":"Universidade Federal da Bahia"},{"author_name":"Jose Alexandre F Diniz-Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

So far it has spread over 200 countries in the whole world. Mathematical modelling of an epidemic like CoVID-19 is always useful for strategic decision making, especially it is very useful to gain some understanding of the future of the epidemic in densely populous countries like India. We use a simple yet effective mathematical model SIR(D) to predict the future of the epidemic in India by using the existing data. We also estimate the effect of lock-down\/social isolation via a time-dependent coefficient of the model. The model study with realistic parameters set shows that the epidemic will be at its peak around the end of June or the first week of July with almost 108 Indians most likely being infected if the lock-down relaxed after May 3, 2020. However, the total number of infected population will become one-third of what predicted here if we consider that people only in the red zones (approximately one-third of India's population) are susceptible to the infection. Even in a very optimistic scenario we expect that at least the infected numbers of people will be of the order of 107.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya Rajesh","author_inst":"IIT, Bhilai, India."},{"author_name":"Haidas Pai","author_inst":"SINP, Kolkata, India."},{"author_name":"Victor Roy","author_inst":"NISER, Bhubaneswar, India."},{"author_name":"Subhasis Samanta","author_inst":"Jan Kochanowski University, 25-406 Kielce, Poland"},{"author_name":"Sabyasachi Ghosh","author_inst":"IIT, Bhilai, India."},{"author_name":"Murugappan Ramanathan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Lane","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenrong Xu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Zhimin Tao","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

Previous studies suggested the hypothesis that nicotine could downregulate the expression of the ACE2. Due to the high level of nicotine intake, the objective of this preliminary study was to assess, at the ecological level, the correlation between tobacco smoking and the attack rate and severity of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU). We have found that there is a statistically significant negative correlation between the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking and the attack rate of COVID-19 in member states of the EU [Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.476 (95% confidence interval -0.117, -0.725) (p-value = 0.012)], meaning that in member states with a higher age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking the attack rate of COVID-19 has been so far lower.

We report for the first time on the natural history of COVID-19 disease from first diagnosis, including both outpatient and hospital care. Methods: Data was obtained from SIDIAP, a primary care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, hospital emergency and inpatient, and mortality registers. All participants >=15 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient between 15th March and 24th April 2020 (10th April for outcome studies) were included. Baseline characteristics, testing, and 30-day outcomes (hospitalisation for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality) were analysed. Results: A total of 121,263 and 95,467 COVID-19 patients were identified for characterisation and outcome studies, respectively. Women (57.8%) and age 45-54 (20.2%) were predominant. 44,709 were tested, with 32,976 (73.8%) PCR+. From 95,467 cases, a 14.6% [14.4-14.9] were hospitalised in the month after diagnosis, with male predominance (19.2% vs 11.3%), peaking at age 75-84. Overall 30-day fatality was 4.0% [95%CI 3.9%-4.2%], higher in men (4.8%) than women (3.4%), increasing with age, and highest in those residing in nursing homes (25.3% [24.2% to 26.4%]). Conclusions: COVID-19 is seen in all age-sex strata, but severe forms of disease cluster in older men and nursing home residents. Although initially managed in primary care, 15% of cases require hospitalization within a month, with overall fatality of 4%.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DANIEL PRIETO-ALHAMBRA","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elisabet Ballo","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Ermengol Coma-Redon","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Nuria Mora","author_inst":"Idiap Jordi Gol"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"Idiap Jordi Gol"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Francesc Fina-Aviles","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Mencia Benitez","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Carolina Guiriguet","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Mireia Fabregas","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Manuel Medina-Peralta","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Idiap Jordi Gol"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group.

The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems. Longitudinal research is needed to explore long-term predictors of poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jill Newby","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute at UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kathleen O'Moore","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute"},{"author_name":"Samantha Tang","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute"},{"author_name":"Helen Christensen","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute"},{"author_name":"Kate Faasse","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Phung N Thai","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Francesc Fina-Aviles","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Mencia Benitez","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Carolina Guiriguet","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Mireia Fabregas","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Manuel Medina-Peralta","author_inst":"Institut Catala de la Salut"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"Idiap Jordi Gol"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

Aims: To estimate the prevalence of common mental health disorders in HCWs based in hospitals where pandemic-affected patients were treated. Method: Databases were searched for studies published before 30th March 2020. Quantitative synthesis was used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental health disorders in four time windows, determined a priori (the acute phase, i.e. during and up to 1.5 months post-pandemic; 1.5-5.9 months; 6-11.9 months; 12 months and later). Results: Nineteen studies met the review criteria. They predominantly addressed the acute phase of the SARS outbreak in Asia. The most studied outcomes were clinically-significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and general psychiatric caseness. For clinically significant PTSS in the acute phase, the prevalence estimate was 23.4% (95% CI 16.3, 31.2; N=4147; I2=96.2%); in the 12 months plus window, the estimate was 11.9% (8.4, 15.8; N=1136; I2=74.3%). For general psychiatric caseness, prevalence estimates were: acute phase, 34.1% (18.7, 51.4; N=3971; I2=99.1%); 6-12 months, 17.9% (13.1, 23.2; N=223; I2=0.0%); 12 months plus, 29.3% (6.0, 61.0; N=710; I2=97.8%). Conclusions: Mental health disorders are particularly common in HCWs working with pandemic-afflicted patients immediately following a pandemic, but the course of disorders following this period is poorly understood. PTSS remained elevated compared to the general population at 12 months, despite there being some evidence for natural recovery. There was considerable heterogeneity, likely linked to methodological differences. More extended follow up of HCWs is needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie M.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional well-being. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on mental wellbeing and mood and feelings questionnaires. Methods: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the multi-languages survey through their networks to general society. Of the 64 questions, 7 were from the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), and 13 were from the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), which are both validated instruments. Results: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p<0.001 and {Delta}%= 9.4 %) in the total score of mental wellbeing was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing during compared to before home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire (i.e., depressive symptoms) showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p<0.001) in total score with more people (+10%) developing depressive symptoms during compared to before home confinement.
