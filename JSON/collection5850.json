Two models developed in the early phases were discarded when they lost statistical validity, The third, current, model is a 3rd-degree polynomial that has remained stable over the last 30 days (since Apr 8), with R2 > 0.998 consistently. This model is used to forecast Total Covid cases, after cautionary discussion of triggers that would invalidate the model. The purpose of all forecasts in the study is to provide a comparator to evaluate policy initiatives to control the pandemic: the forecasts are not objectives by themselves. Actual observations less than forecasts mean successful policy interventions. Figures of Doubling Time, Fatality Rate and Recovery Rate used by authorities are questioned. Elongation of doubling rates is inherent in the model, and worthy of mention only when the time actually exceeds what the model predicts. The popular Fatality Rate and Recovery Rate metrics are shown to be illogical. The study defines two terms Ongoing Fatality Rate (OFR), and Ongoing Recovery Rate (ORR) and determines these currently to be ~9% and ~76% respectively in India. Over time, OFR will decline to the eventual Case Fatality Rate (CFR), while ORR will eventually climb to (1-CFR). There is no statistical basis to assume eventual Indian CFR, and 5.5% CFR at China is used as a proxy. Using these metrics, the current model forecasts by May-end, >150000 Total Infected, [~]5000 Deaths and >85000 Active Cases. There is no pull-back evident in the current model in the foreseeable future, and cases continue to rise at progressively slower rates. Subject to usual caveats, the model is used to forecast till Sep 15. The study argues that Indian hospital infrastructure is reasonably ready to handle Active Cases as predicted for Sept 15: in that sense, the curve is FLAT ENOUGH. However, the curve is NOT flat enough with respect to fatalities: nearly 100000 by Sept 15. Setting an arbitrary limit that Total Deaths must be within 50,000 by Sept 15, the study retrofits a model that shows what the desired growth of Covid19 cases should be. It is seen that overall doubling time of 38 days is required in period June 1 to Sep 15, if deaths are to remain below 50000.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Smarajit Dey","author_inst":"Independent Consultant"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20102657","rel_title":"The differential impact of physical distancing strategies on social contacts relevant for the spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20102657","rel_abs":"Physical distancing measures are intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

In this manuscript we estimate the reproduction number during the early transmission phase in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We also estimate the reproduction number and conduct short term forecasts for the most recent developments in the epidemic trajectory of COVID-19 in Chile (May 9th-July 7th, 2020) to study the effectiveness of re-imposition of lockdowns in the country. The incidence curve in Chile displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our analysis emphasizes that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, easing of the COVID-19 restrictions and spread of virus to the low income neighborhoods in May led to a new wave of infections, followed by the re-imposition of lockdowns in Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.87( 95% CI: 0.84, 0.89) as of July 7th, 2020. Our current findings point that the sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile is being brought under control. The COVID-19 epidemic followed an early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) that transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7th, 2020. While the broad scale social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing and active case detection and isolation efforts to bring epidemic under control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amna Tariq","author_inst":"Georgia State University  School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eduardo A.

Mathematical modeling can be utilized to forecast the final numbers as well as the endpoint of the disease in India and its states, as well as assess the impact of social distancing measures. In the present work, the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Logistic Growth model have been implemented to predict the endpoint of COVID-19 in India as well as three states accounting for over 55% of the total cases - Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi. The results using the SIR model indicate that the disease will reach an endpoint in India on 12 September, while Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi will reach endpoints on 20 August, 30 July and 9 September respectively. Using the Logistic Regression model, the endpoint for India is predicted on 23 July, while that for Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi is 5 July, 23 June and 10 August respectively. It is also observed that the case numbers predicted by the SIR model are greater than those for the Logistic Growth model in each case. The results suggest that the lockdown enacted by the Government of India has had only a moderate impact on the spread of COVID-19, and emphasize the need for firm implementation of social distancing guidelines.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhoomika Malhotra","author_inst":"Kamala Nehru College, Delhi University"},{"author_name":"Vishesh Kashyap","author_inst":"Delhi Technological University"},{"author_name":"Carla Castillo Laborde","author_inst":"Centro de Epidemiologia y Politicas de Salud, Facultad de Medicina, Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile"},{"author_name":"Katia Vogt-Geisse","author_inst":"Facultad de Ingenieria y Ciencias, Universidad Adolfo Ibanez, Santiago, Chile"},{"author_name":"Ruiyan Luo","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20096362","rel_title":"A stochastic, individual-based model for the evaluation of the impact of non-pharmacological interventions on COVID-19 transmission in Slovakia","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20096362","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most significant healthcare challenges that humanity faces.

We assess the impact of the governmental non-pharmacological interventions, such as population-wide social distancing, social distancing within specific subsets of population, reduction of travel between the municipalities, and self-quarantining of the infected individuals. We also evaluate the impact of relaxing of strict restrictions, efficacy of the simple state feedback-based restrictions in controlling the outbreak, and the effect of superspreaders on the disease dynamics.

Design and setting: An online sample of 1404 healthy individuals was collected through the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Bangladesh. The survey was conducted between March 27, 2020, and April 7, 2020, following the Bangladesh government's lockdown announcement. Method: A questionnaire comprising the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) and sociodemographic information was posted to an online survey. Results: The mean wellbeing value was 38.4 (standard deviation, 11.2), indicating a lower mental health level exist in adults. Also, the mean wellbeing score for males was 39.0 (10.8) units compared to females with scores 37.0 (11.2), and the highest scores for government workers was 41.2 (11.8). Unemployment (35.6) or business employees (35.5) have a lower level of mental health. In the lockout days, the elderly population of age 50 years and above had high day-to-day variation of wellbeing scores. After confounding adjustment in multivariable linear regression models, there found a better wellbeing scores for males (estimate=1.79, 95% CI=0.5, 3.1), and government-workers (estimate=5.86, 95% CI=2.2, 9.5). Moreover, the never-married female had significantly higher well-being score compared to married women (estimate=3.31, 95% CI=1.0, 5.7). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with low mental wellbeing that indicates depression in our study. Suggestions for improvement will be implemented to promote the mental health to women, unemployed and business communities. Older people 50 years of age and over reported a greater day-to-day variation in their mental health. The married women with their decreased mental wellbeing should be given special consideration. The research will help let clinicians and policymakers decide where the measures can be implemented to improve their mental health during and after this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Hossain","author_inst":"North South University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Professionals"},{"author_name":"Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Gias Ahsan","author_inst":"North South University"},{"author_name":"Ruiyan Luo","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20098228","rel_title":"COVID-19 pandemic: every day feels like a weekday to most","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20098228","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak has clear clinical and economic impacts, but also affects behaviors e.g. through social distancing, and may increase stress and anxiety.

Revealing the influencing factors affecting transmission of COVID-19 is essential to take effective control measures. Several previous studies suggested that the spread of COVID-19 was likely associated with temperature and\/or humidity. But, a recent extensive review indicated that conclusions on associations between climate and COVID-19 were elusive with high uncertainty due to caveats in most previous studies, such as limitations in time and space, data quality and confounding factors. In this study, by using a more extensive global dataset covering 578 time series from China, USA, Europe and the rest of the world, we show that climate show distinct impacts on early and late transmission of COVID-19 in the world after excluding the confounding factors. The early transmission ability of COVID-19 peaked around 6.3{degrees}C without or with little human intervention, but the later transmission ability was reduced in high temperature conditions under human intervention, probably driven by increased control efficiency of COVID-19. The transmission ability was positively associated with the founding population size of early reported cases and population size of a location. Our study suggested that with the coming summer seasons, the transmission risk of COVID-19 would increase in the high-latitude or high-altitude regions but decrease in low-latitude or low-altitude regions; human intervention is essential in containing the spread of COVID-19 around the world.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"xinru wan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management on Pest Insects and Rodents in Agriculture, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyuan Cheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management on Pest Insects and Rodents in Agriculture, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"zhibin zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management on Pest Insects and Rodents in Agriculture, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lyle H Ungar","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Konrad P Kording","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20096826","rel_title":"Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in India, and evaluating the impact of asymptomatic carriers and role of expanded testing in the lockdown exit strategy: a modelling approach","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20096826","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 3 200 000 cases and 230 000 deaths as on 2 May 2020, and has quickly become an unprecedented global health threat. India, with its unique challenges in fighting this pandemic, imposed one of the worlds strictest and largest population-wide lockdown on 25 March 2020. Here, we estimated key epidemiological parameters and evaluated the effect of control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in India. Through a modelling approach, we explored various strategies to exit the lockdown. Methods: We obtained data from 140 confirmed COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital in India to estimate the delay from symptom onset to confirmation and the proportion of cases without symptoms. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt) after adjusting for imported cases and reporting lag, using incidence data from 4 March to 25 April 2020 for India. We built upon the SEIR model to account for underreporting, reporting delays, and varying asymptomatic proportion and infectivity. Using this model, we simulated lockdown relaxation under various scenarios to evaluate its effect on the second wave, and also modelled increased detection through testing. We hypothesised that increased testing after lockdown relaxation will decrease the epidemic growth enough to allow for a greater resumption of normal social mixing thus minimising the social and economic fallout. Findings: The median delay from symptom onset to confirmation (reporting lag) was estimated to be 2{middle dot}68 days (95% CI 2{middle dot}00-3{middle dot}00) with an IQR of 2{middle dot}03 days (95% CI 1{middle dot}00-3{middle dot}00). 60{middle dot}7% of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=140) were found to be asymptomatic. The R0 for India was estimated to be 2{middle dot}083 (95% CI 2{middle dot}044-2{middle dot}122 ; R2 = 0{middle dot}972), while the Rt gradually down trended from 1{middle dot}665 (95%CI 1{middle dot}539-1{middle dot}789) on 30 March to 1{middle dot}159 (95% CI 1{middle dot}128-1{middle dot}189) on 22 April. In the modelling, we observed that the time lag from date of lockdown relaxation to start of second wave increases as lockdown is extended farther after the first wave peak. This benefit was greater for a gradual relaxation as compared to a sudden lifting of lockdown. We found that increased detection through testing decreases the number of total infections and symptomatic cases, and the benefit of detecting each extra case was higher when prevailing transmission rates were higher (as when restrictions are relaxed). Lower levels of social restrictions when coupled with increased testing, could achieve similar outcomes as an aggressive social distancing regime where testing was not increased. Interpretation: The aggressive control measures in India since 25 March have produced measurable reductions in transmission, although suppression needs to be maintained to achieve sub-threshold Rt. Additional benefits for mitigating the second wave can be achieved if lockdown can be feasibly extended farther after the peak of active cases has passed. Aggressive measures like lockdowns may inherently be enough to suppress the epidemic, however other measures need to be scaled up as lockdowns are relaxed. Expanded testing is expected to play a pivotal role in the lockdown exit strategy and will determine the degree of return to normalcy that will be possible. Increased testing coverage will also ensure rapid feedback from surveillance systems regarding any resurgence in cases, so that geo-temporally targeted measures can be instituted at the earliest. Considering that asymptomatics play an undeniable role in transmission of COVID-19, it may be prudent to reduce the dependence on presence of symptoms for implementing control strategies, behavioral changes and testing.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohak Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Saptarshi Soham Mohanta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, India"},{"author_name":"Aditi Rao","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Giridara Gopal Parameswaran","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Mudit Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Mehak Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Archisman Mazumder","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ayush Lohiya","author_inst":"Super Specialty Cancer Institute & Hospital, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar, India"},{"author_name":"Agam Bansal","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA"},{"author_name":"Rohit Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ved Prakash Meena","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pawan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20102764","rel_title":"Impact of relaxing Covid-19 social distancing measures on rural North Wales: a simulation analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20102764","rel_abs":"Background: Social distancing policies aimed to limit Covid-19 are gradually being relaxed as nationally reported peaks in incident cases are passed. Population density is an important driver of national incidence rates; however peak incidences in rural regions may lag national figures by several weeks. We aimed to forecast the impact of relaxed social distancing rules on rural North Wales. Methods: Daily data on the deaths of people with a positive test for Covid-19 were obtained from Public Health Wales and the UK Government. Sigmoidal growth functions were fitted by non-linear least squares and model averaging used to extrapolate mortality over time. The dates of peak mortality incidences for North Wales, Wales and the UK; and the percentage predicted maximum mortality (as of 7th May 2020) were estimated. Results: The peak daily death rates in Wales and the UK were estimated to have occurred on the 14\/04\/2020 and 15\/04\/2020, respectively. For North Wales, this occurred on the 07\/05\/2020, corresponding to the date of analysis. The number of deaths reported in North Wales represents 31% of the predicted total cumulative number, compared with 71% and 60% for Wales and the UK, respectively. Conclusion: Policies governing the movement of people in the gradual release from lockdown are likely to impact significantly on areas -principally rural in nature- where cases of Covid-19, deaths and immunity are likely to be much lower than in populated areas. This is particularly difficult to manage across jurisdictions, such as between England and Wales, and in popular holiday destinations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rhodri P Hughes","author_inst":"Ysgol Glan Clwyd"},{"author_name":"Dyfrig A Hughes","author_inst":"Bangor University"},{"author_name":"Aditi Rao","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Giridara Gopal Parameswaran","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Mudit Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Mehak Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Archisman Mazumder","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ayush Lohiya","author_inst":"Super Specialty Cancer Institute & Hospital, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar, India"},{"author_name":"Agam Bansal","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA"},{"author_name":"Rohit Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ved Prakash Meena","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pawan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20102343","rel_title":"Is it Just About Physical Health?

However, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health were not thoroughly investigated yet, and studies that report the mental health risks of COVID-19 are still scarce. Objectives This study aimed to assess the level of psychological distress among university students in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated national measures. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire, The survey comprised of questions about (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), (iii) coping activities , and (iv) the students most serious concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n=199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). The total K10 distress scores had a mean of 34.2 (SD:9.4). However, the mean of total K10 distress scores had no significant association with gender (P=0.57). Age was negatively associated with total K10 distress scores (P=0.0013). Concerning severity, most of the respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n=265, 69.5%), and females were found to have a statistically significant higher percentage in mild and severe psychological distress (P= 0.035), (P=0.016); respectively. 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (P<0.0001). The most common coping strategy among students was Spending more time on social media (n=269, 70.6%). Besides, 49 students (12.9%) reported the use of medications to cope with COVID-19 related distress, and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning was their most serious concern. Conclusion The COVID-19 control measures resulted in a severe disruption of various human life activities, and this could impact the mental health of individuals, including students. A nationwide psychological support program should be incorporated into Jordan response strategy in combating the COVID-19, considering students and other vulnerable groups in Jordan.

By the 3rd of May 2020, a total of 28 patients have been admitted to the Turku University Hospital. In this paper, we explore baseline characteristics in order to identify risk for severe Covid-19 disease and critical care admission. Methods For this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from hospital records. Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise patients, including medians, percentiles and frequencies. Differences were tested with Mann Whitney U-test and Pearson's chi-square test. Results Pre-existent obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was present in 29% of patients admitted in the hospital for Covid-19, none of them having severe OSA. Overall, other findings on admission were comparable with those reported elsewhere. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg\/L versus 52 mg\/L, p<0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower oxygen saturation on admission in ICU-patients (87% versus 93%, p=0.09). Discussion OSA was pre-existent in a disproportional large group of patients, which suggests that it is an important risk factor for severe Covid-19. Furthermore, we identified high CRP, PCT and possibly oxygen saturation as useful clinical measures to identify patients at risk for critical care.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thijs Feuth","author_inst":"Division of Medicine, Department of Pulmonary Diseases, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland."},{"author_name":"Tarja Saaresranta","author_inst":"Division of Medicine, Department of Pulmonary Diseases, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland."},{"author_name":"Antti Karlsson","author_inst":"Auria Biobank, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mika Valtonen","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"},{"author_name":"Ville Peltola","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku"},{"author_name":"Esa Rintala","author_inst":"Department of Hospital Hygiene and Infection Control, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland."},{"author_name":"Jarmo Oksi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Turku University Hospital, University of Turku, Turku, Finland."},{"author_name":"Ayush Lohiya","author_inst":"Super Specialty Cancer Institute & Hospital, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar, India"},{"author_name":"Agam Bansal","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA"},{"author_name":"Rohit Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ved Prakash Meena","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pawan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20098368","rel_title":"Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: a systematic review","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20098368","rel_abs":"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread, concerns regarding its effects on pregnancy outcomes have been growing.

Males are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Genomic studies are in process to identify differences in host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS Genomic structures were examined for the ACE2 gene that encodes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the obligate receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Variants in 213,158 exomes\/genomes were integrated with ACE2 protein functional domains, and pathogenicity criteria from the American Society of Human Genetics and Genomics\/Association for Molecular Pathology. RESULTS 483 variants were identified in the 19 exons of ACE2 on the X chromosome. All variants were rare, including nine loss-of-function (potentially SARS-CoV-2 protective) alleles present only in female heterozygotes. Unopposed variant alleles were more common in males (262\/3596 [7.3%] nucleotides) than females (9\/3596 [0.25%] nucleotides, p<0.0001). 37 missense variants substituted amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 interacting regions or critical domains for transmembrane ACE2 expression. Four upstream open reading frames with 31 associated variants were identified. Excepting loss-of-function alleles, variants would not meet minimum criteria for classification as Likely Pathogenic\/beneficial if differential frequencies emerged in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Males are more exposed to consequences from a single variant ACE2 allele. Common risk\/beneficial alleles are unlikely in regions subject to evolutionary constraint. ACE2 upstream open reading frames may have implications for aminoglycoside use in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. For this SARS-CoV-2-interacting protein with pre-identified functional domains, pre-emptive functional and computational studies are encouraged to accelerate interpretations of genomic variation for personalised and public health use.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claire L Shovlin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marcela P Vizcaychipi","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Frank Chervenak","author_inst":"Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra\/Northwell"},{"author_name":"Laurent J Salomon","author_inst":"Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades"},{"author_name":"Baderledeen Ahmed","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Arash Rafii","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine - Qatar"},{"author_name":"Jarmo Oksi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Turku University Hospital, University of Turku, Turku, Finland."},{"author_name":"Ayush Lohiya","author_inst":"Super Specialty Cancer Institute & Hospital, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar, India"},{"author_name":"Agam Bansal","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA"},{"author_name":"Rohit Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ved Prakash Meena","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pawan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20098699","rel_title":"Unequal impact of structural health determinants and comorbidity on COVID-19 severity and lethality in older Mexican adults: Looking beyond chronological aging","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20098699","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older adults. The population of Mexico is younger, yet the impact of COVID-19 on older adults is comparable to countries with older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging. METHODS: We analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for improving COVID-19 mortality risk prediction. RESULTS: We analyzed 7,029 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged [&ge;]60 years. Male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization and ICU admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity compared to chronological age. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Structural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults. Clinical decision-making related to COVID-19 should focus away from chronological aging onto more a comprehensive geriatric care approach.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Geriatria"},{"author_name":"Armando Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Neftali E.

The first is a data driven approach for predicting the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM-SAE network, which are somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered features representing a country's response to the early spread of the pandemic. A Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the 19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with Sao Paulo leading with almost 65 thousand estimated, confirmed cases. The estimated end of the pandemics (with 97 % of cases reaching an outcome) starts as of May 28th for some states and rests through August 14th, 2020.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igor Gadelha Pereira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Joris M Guerin","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Andouglas Goncalves Silva Jr.","author_inst":"Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Norte"},{"author_name":"Cosimo Distante","author_inst":"CNR"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Santos Garcia","author_inst":"Universidade de Brasilia"},{"author_name":"Luiz M.G.

COVID-19 results in higher pathogenicity and mortality in the elderly compared to children. Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive coronavirus immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses, is critical to understand such divergent clinical outcomes. The cross-reactivity of coronavirus antibody responses of healthy children (n=89), adults (n=98), elderly (n=57), and COVID-19 patients (n=19) were analysed by systems serology. While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Fc{gamma} receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc upon infection, enhancing Fc{gamma} receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity. These results suggest that less-experienced humoral immunity associated with higher IgM, as observed in children, may have the potential to induce more potent antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. These key insights will inform COVID-19 vaccination strategies, improved serological diagnostics and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin J.

There has been lack of clarity on the meaning of reported rates of false positives and false negatives. For risk assessment and clinical decision making, the rates of interest are the positive and negative predictive values of a test. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a person who tests positive has been infected. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been infected. The medical literature regularly reports different statistics, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an infected person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a non-infected person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity permits one to predict the test result given a person's true infection status. These predictions are not directly relevant to risk assessment or clinical decisions, where one knows a test result and wants to predict whether a person has been infected. Given estimates of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the rate of illness in the population. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of inference on the PPV and NPV of COVID-19 antibody tests given estimates of sensitivity and specificity and credible bounds on prevalence. I explain the methodological problem, show how to estimate bounds on PPV and NPV, and apply the findings to some tests authorized by the FDA.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles F.

One such neglected health determinant is the sex of the patient. This is an essential clinical characteristic, as it can factor into a patient's clinical management and preventative measures. Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease. However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified non-randomized studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thushara Galbadage","author_inst":"Biola University"},{"author_name":"Brent M.

Methods : In order to assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30 COVID-19 inpatients and monitored the detection kinetics of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies with in-house ELISAs. We also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in these samples as well as 25 asymptomatic carrier samples using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2. Results : We observed that specific antibodies were detectable in all inpatients two weeks post-symptom onset. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and RBD was more sensitive than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits. Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau two weeks post-symptom onset and then declined in the majority of inpatients. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in 56% of asymptomatic carriers. Conclusions : Our results raise questions concerning the role played by neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 cure and protection against secondary infection. They also suggest that induction of neutralizing antibodies is not the only strategy to adopt for the development of a vaccine. Finally, they imply that anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies should be titrated to optimize convalescent plasma therapy.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Etienne Brochot","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Demey","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Antoine Touze","author_inst":"University of Tours, France"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Belouzard","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Dubuisson","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Schmit","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Gilles Duverlie","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Catherine Francois","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Castelain","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Helle","author_inst":"University of Picardie Jules Verne, France"},{"author_name":"Chinn Yi Wong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"David C.

However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100% - in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence of COVID-19 is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and around the world. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Sempos","author_inst":"Vitamin D Standardization Program LLC"},{"author_name":"Lu Tian","author_inst":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Antoine Touze","author_inst":"University of Tours, France"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Belouzard","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Dubuisson","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Schmit","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Gilles Duverlie","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Catherine Francois","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Castelain","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Helle","author_inst":"University of Picardie Jules Verne, France"},{"author_name":"Chinn Yi Wong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"David C.

More generally, it provides a potential study design blueprint to other investigators for any interventional COVID-19 study looking to evaluate interventions for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 infection. This specific study described is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxycycline for the prevention of COVID-19 infection and disease in healthcare workers with ongoing high risk exposure to COVID-19. This study would consist of a 50-day Treatment Period (Day 0-Day 50), followed by an End of Study Visit, approximately 30 days after completion of study drug dosing. Initially, for approximately the first 4 to 6 weeks, an initial open-label arm would be enrolled with up to 1938 subjects who will be assigned to take 20mg doxycycline BID. In the double blind, placebo controlled arms approximately 3,692 participants would be randomized to either doxycycline or placebo for 50 days. Doxycycline is a rational candidate drug to be evaluated for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Doxycycline is a generally safe tetracycline derivative that has been available for decades, most commonly dosed at 100mg BID to treat bacterial infections. However, in addition to its anti-microbial properties, doxycycline (and more generally tetracycline derivatives) may have a role as an effective anti-viral agent and as an anti-inflammatory drug. Early studies indicate potential efficacy of minocycline against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [12], and doxycycline against Dengue and Chikungunya infection[9, 10]. In addition, doxycycline is known or proposed to target several pathways that regulate viral replication. [13, 14, 15]. Doxycycline is a particularly attractive candidate as a COVID-19 prophylactic given it has been used in clinical practice for decades and maintains an excellent safety profile as demonstrated in multiple clinical studies. Any effective prophylaxis for COVID-19 should be able to demonstrate high efficacy at preventing infection and\/or lowering severity of disease. Equally important, it should demonstrate this efficacy at dosing levels that are highly unlikely to precipitate any untoward severe side effects. Doxycycline has been selected based on its ability to: 1) inhibit metalloproteinases (MMPs), implicated in initial viral entry into the cell as well as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe COVID-19 infection [13, 16]; 2) potential to inhibit Papain-like proteinase (PLpro) responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyprotein to release non-structural proteins 1, 2 & 3 (Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3) all essential for viral replication. [19]; 3) potential to inhibit 3C-like main protease (3CLpro) or Nsp5 which is cleaved from the polyproteins causes further cleavage of Nsp4-16 and mediates maturation of Nsps which is essential in the virus lifecycle. [19]; 4) act as an ionophore help transport Zinc intracellularly, increasing cellular concentrations of Zinc to inhibit viral replication. [6, 15]; 5) inhibit Nf-kB which may lower inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection, and lower risk of viral entry due to decreasing DPP4 cell surface receptor. [20, 21]; 6) inhibits (specifically low-dose doxycycline) expression of CD147\/EMMPRIN that may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into T lymphocytes [22, 23].","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul A Yates","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Ashton M Leone","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Elias Reichel","author_inst":"Tufts University"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Belouzard","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Dubuisson","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Schmit","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Gilles Duverlie","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Catherine Francois","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Castelain","author_inst":"CHU Amiens, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Helle","author_inst":"University of Picardie Jules Verne, France"},{"author_name":"Chinn Yi Wong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"David C.

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian nonlinear mixed model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectory. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for infections and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluate forecasting accuracy on a two-week holdout set, finding that the model predicts COVID-19 cases and deaths well, with a mean absolute scaled error of 0.40 for cases and 0.32 for deaths throughout the two-week evaluation period. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Ohio, and Mississippi. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gregory L Watson","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Di Xiong","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Zoller","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"John Shamshoian","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Phillip Sundin","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Teresa Bufford","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Anne W Rimoin","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Christina M Ramirez","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chinn Yi Wong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"David C.

A study in Italy reported that EMS-documented out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rose by 58% during the peak-epidemic. EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia-low oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the absence of dyspnea-is associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Tijuana is a city on the Mexico-United States border that may serve as a bellwether for cities in other LMICs. Using EMS data, we assess changes in out-of-hospital mortality and the SpO2 of respiratory patients during the COVID-19 period. Methods: We calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases seen by EMS in Tijuana, and estimate the difference between peak-epidemic rates and forecasted 2014-2019 trends. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean (SpO2). Results: An estimated 194.7 (95%CI: 135.5-253.9) excess out-of-hospital deaths events occurred during April 14th-May 11th, representing an increase of 145% (70%-338%) compared to forecasted trends. During the same window, only 8 COVID-19-positive, out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with a rise in respiratory cases of 274% (119%-1142%), and a drop in mean SpO2 to 77.7%, from 90.2% at baseline. Peak respiratory cases were concentrated in high-SES neighborhoods, while the highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-SES areas. Conclusions: EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in LMICs. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly threefold greater magnitude than increases reported in Italy. Furthermore, these deaths may be missing from official records describing COVID-19 patients. We also found evidence of worsening hypoxemia among respiratory patients seen by EMS, suggesting a rise in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed that social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Friedman","author_inst":"Center for Social Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA"},{"author_name":"Alheli Calderon-Villarreal","author_inst":"Academia Mexicana de la Salud, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Ietza Bojorquez","author_inst":"El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Carlos Vera Hernandez","author_inst":"Mexican Red Cross, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"David Schriger","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eva Tovar Hirashima","author_inst":"Mexican Red Cross, Tijuana, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Teresa Bufford","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Anne W Rimoin","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Christina M Ramirez","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chinn Yi Wong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"David C.

Most studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities to date have focused on hospitalized patients or have not characterized who received testing or those who tested positive for Covid-19. Objective: To compare patterns of testing and test results for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and subsequent mortality by race and ethnicity in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Participants: 5,834,543 individuals in care, among whom 62,098 were tested and 5,630 tested positive for Covid-19 between February 8 and May 4, 2020. Exposures: Self-reported race\/ethnicity. Main outcome measures: We evaluated associations between race\/ethnicity and receipt of Covid-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, accounting for a wide range of demographic and clinical risk factors including comorbid conditions, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. Results: Among all individuals in care, 74% were non-Hispanic white (white), 19% non-Hispanic black (black), and 7% Hispanic. Compared with white individuals, black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 (tests per 1000: white=9.0, [95% CI 8.9 to 9.1]; black=16.4, [16.2 to 16.7]; and Hispanic=12.2, [11.9 to 12.5]). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (black vs white: OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.12; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.96), 30-day mortality did not differ by race\/ethnicity (black vs white: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.33; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87). Conclusions: Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of Covid-19 not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care. While there was no observed difference in mortality by race or ethnicity, our findings may underestimate risk in the broader US population as health disparities tend to be reduced in VA.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Near-future estimates are also useful for outbreaks of other diseases. Short-term predictions are unlikely to be affected by changes in herd immunity. In the absence of major net changes in factors that affect reproduction number (R), the two-parameter exponential model should be a standard model - indeed, it has been standard for epidemiological analysis of pandemics for a century but in recent decades has lost popularity to more complex compartmental models. Exponential model should be routinely included in reports describing epidemiological models as a reference, or null hypothesis. Exponential models should be fitted separately for each epidemiologically distinct jurisdiction. They should also be fitted separately to time intervals that differ by any major changes in factors that affect R. Using an exponential model, incidence-count half-life is a better statistic than R. Here an example of the exponential model is applied to King County, Washington during Spring 2020. The parameters and predictions of this model have remained stable for at least 45 days and the accuracy of model predictions has outperformed models with more parameters.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jared C Roach","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Farah Kidwai-Khan","author_inst":"US Department of Veterans Affairs, Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Janet P.

The virus is named as SARS-CoV-2. In this situation, rational decisions need to be made on how the care is provided for patients with COVID-19. The Incidence report, general symptoms and readily available testing kits, different control strategies, the basic compartmental model, and some of the current research on the epidemiology of the disease are discussed and previously published models are reviewed. Modeling this disease helps in understanding the spread, and predict its future to evaluate different control strategies (Social Distancing, Contact Tracing and Hospitalization). Compartmental modeling framework is used in this work. The non-linear equations are formulated and fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data. Analytical analysis along with uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis is performed, and the conditions to achieve disease free equilibrium is evaluated. Finally, Different control strategies are simulated to show their importance. This paper aims to shows the advantage of mathematical modeling and their simulations in times like now, during which the COVID-19 spreading like wildfire. It also includes Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the modeling. The simulations are performed for the model fit to Cumulative Case and Mortality data in the United States of America.
