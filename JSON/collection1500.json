Until now, the cytotoxic T cell response has not been very well characterized in COVID-19 patients.\n\nHere, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOur data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development.\n\nImportanceCytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years. Thus, the absence of a cytotoxic response in elderly patients might be a possible reason for the more frequent severity of COVID-19 in this age group in comparison to younger patients.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaana Westmeier","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen"},{"author_name":"Krystallenia Paniskaki","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen,"},{"author_name":"Zehra Karak\u00f6se","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen,"},{"author_name":"Tanja Werner","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Sutter","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Dolff","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Marvin Overbeck","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Andreas Limmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Thorsten Brenner","author_inst":"Essen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marc M.

The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan ({lambda}-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with EC50 values ranging from 0.3-1.4 g\/ml. No toxicity to host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 g\/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that {lambda}-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing entry. Moreover, intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, {lambda}-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection by several respiratory viruses.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ye Jin Jang","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heegwon Shin","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Myoung Kyu Lee","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Oh Seung Kwon","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jin Soo Shin","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yongil Kim","author_inst":"Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co."},{"author_name":"Meehyein Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Andreas Limmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Thorsten Brenner","author_inst":"Essen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marc M.

Though this tool is built on top of projections of the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is agnostic as to which model--of which many are available--provides these projections. The tool combines COVID-19 patient census projections with information like staffing ratios and frequency of patient contact to provide projections of the number of items of key types of PPE needed under three built-in conservation scenarios: standard, contingency, and crisis. Users are also able to customize the tool to the specifics of their hospital and design custom conservation policies.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristian Lum","author_inst":"Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"James Johndrow","author_inst":"Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"April Cardone","author_inst":"Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Barry Fuchs","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Cody Cotner","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Olivia Jew","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Ravi Parikh","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Michael Draugelis","author_inst":"Predictive Healthcare, University of Pennsylvania Hospital System, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Thaibinh Luong","author_inst":"Predictive Healthcare, University of Pennsylvania Hospital System, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Asaf Hanish","author_inst":"Predictive Healthcare, University of Pennsylvania Hospital System, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Gary Eric Weissman","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christian Terwiesch","author_inst":"Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin Volpp","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Union Hospital of Tonji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Nina Babel","author_inst":"Medical Department I, Marien Hospital Herne, University Hospital of the Ruhr-University Bochum"},{"author_name":"Timm Westhoff","author_inst":"Medical Department I, Marien Hospital Herne, University Hospital of the Ruhr-University Bochum"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Gennadiy Zelinskyy","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20174169","rel_title":"Associations of comorbidities and medications with COVID-19 outcome: A retrospective analysis of real-world evidence data","rel_date":"2020-08-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20174169","rel_abs":"Background: Hundreds of thousands of deaths have already been recorded for patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; aka COVID-19). Understanding whether there is a relationship between comorbidities and COVID-19 positivity will not only impact clinical decisions, it will also allow an understanding of how better to define the long-term complications in the groups at risk. In turn informing national policy on who may benefit from more stringent social distancing and shielding strategies. Furthermore, understanding the associations between medications and certain outcomes may also further our understanding of indicators of vulnerability in people with COVID-19 and co-morbidities. Methods: Electronic healthcare records (EHR) from two London hospitals were analysed between 1st January and 27th May 2020. 5294 patients presented to the hospitals in whom COVID status was formally assessed; 1253 were positive for COVID-19 and 4041 were negative. This dataset was analysed to identify associations between comorbidities and medications, separately and two outcomes: (1) presentation with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis, and (2) inpatient death following COVID-19 positive diagnosis. Medications were analysed in different time windows of prescription to differentiate between short-term and long-term medications. All analyses were done with controls (without co-morbidity) matched for age, sex, and number of admissions, and a robustness approach was conducted to only accept results that consistently appear when the analysis is repeated with different proportions of the data. Results: We observed higher COVID-19 positive presentation for patients with hypertension (1.7 [1.3-2.1]) and diabetes (1.6 [1.2-2.1]). We observed higher inpatient COVID-19 mortality for patients with hypertension (odds ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.9-3.9]), diabetes (2.2 [1.4-3.5]), congestive heart failure (3.1 [1.5-6.4]), and renal disease (2.6 [1.4-5.1]). We also observed an association with reduced COVID-19 mortality for diabetic patients for whom anticoagulants (0.11 [0.03-0.50]), lipid-regulating drugs (0.15 [0.04-0.58]), penicillins (0.20 [0.06-0.63]), or biguanides (0.19 [0.05-0.70]) were administered within 21 days after their positive COVID-19 test with no evidence that they were on them before, and for hypertensive patients for whom anticoagulants (0.08 [0.02-0.35]), antiplatelet drugs (0.10 [0.02-0.59]), lipid-regulating drugs (0.15 [0.05-0.46]), penicillins (0.14 [0.05-0.45]), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs) (0.06 [0.01-0.53]) were administered within 21 days post-COVID-19-positive testing with no evidence that they were on them before. Moreover, long-term antidiabetic drugs were associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality in diabetic patients (0.26 [0.10-0.67]). Conclusions: We provided real-world evidence for observed associations between COVID-19 outcomes and a number of comorbidities and medications. These results require further investigation and replication in other data sets.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Basel Abu-Jamous","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc"},{"author_name":"Arseni Anisimovich","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc"},{"author_name":"Janie Baxter","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc"},{"author_name":"Marcela P Vizcaychipi","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alex McCarthy","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rabia T Khan","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc"},{"author_name":"Michael Draugelis","author_inst":"Predictive Healthcare, University of Pennsylvania Hospital System, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Thaibinh Luong","author_inst":"Predictive Healthcare, University of Pennsylvania Hospital System, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Asaf Hanish","author_inst":"Predictive Healthcare, University of Pennsylvania Hospital System, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Gary Eric Weissman","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christian Terwiesch","author_inst":"Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kevin Volpp","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Union Hospital of Tonji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Nina Babel","author_inst":"Medical Department I, Marien Hospital Herne, University Hospital of the Ruhr-University Bochum"},{"author_name":"Timm Westhoff","author_inst":"Medical Department I, Marien Hospital Herne, University Hospital of the Ruhr-University Bochum"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Gennadiy Zelinskyy","author_inst":"University Hospital Essen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.20178699","rel_title":"Systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics to model response to antiviral therapies","rel_date":"2020-08-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.20178699","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 viral loads change rapidly following symptom onset so to assess antivirals it is important to understand the natural history and patient factors influencing this. We undertook an individual patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in humans to describe viral dynamics and estimate the effects of antivirals used to-date. Methods: This systematic review identified case reports, case series and clinical trial data from publications between 1\/1\/2020 and 31\/5\/2020 following PRISMA guidelines. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox-PH) of time to viral clearance was fitted to respiratory and stool samples. A simplified four parameter nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model was fitted to viral load trajectories in all sampling sites and covariate modelling of respiratory viral dynamics was performed to quantify time dependent drug effects. Findings: Patient-level data from 645 individuals (age 1 month-100 years) with 6316 viral loads were extracted. Model-based simulations of viral load trajectories in samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract, stool, blood, urine, ocular secretions and breast milk were generated. Cox-PH modelling showed longer time to viral clearance in older patients, males and those with more severe disease. Remdesivir was associated with faster viral clearance (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 9.19, p<0.001), as well as interferon, particularly when combined with ribavirin (AHR = 2.2, p=0.015; AHR = 6.04, p = 0.006). Interpretation: Combination therapy including interferons should be further investigated. A NLME model for designing and analysing viral pharmacodynamics in trials has been established.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silke Gastine","author_inst":"University College London Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Juanita Pang","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florencia A.T.

Here, we analyzed the metatranscriptomic data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 19 COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy controls from 6 independent projects and detailed the active microbiota landscape in both healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 could deeply change the lung microbiota, evidenced by the -diversity, {beta}-diversity and species composition analysis based on bacterial microbiota and virome. Pathogens (such as Klebsiella oxytoca causing pneumonia as well), immunomodulatory probiotics (such as Lactic Acid Bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a butyrate producer) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were enriched in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a severe microbiota dysbiosis. The significant correlation between Rothia mucilaginosa, TMV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed drastic inflammatory battles between the host, SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes in the lungs. Notably, TMV only existed in the COVID-19 group, while Human respirovirus 3 only existed in the healthy group.

All neonates are being tested for antibodies using immunochemoluminiscency tests; if the mother is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a naso-pharyngeal swab is also obtained from the child for RT-PCR analysis. Children will be followed-up for one year in order to ascertain the effect that COVID-19 on their development. As of 29th July, 477 women have been recruited (212, 132 and 133 for sub-cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Eight women tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Seven children were born from these women and all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Summarizing, we are recruiting a cohort of 1000 pregnant women and their neonates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results so far show that few women were infected at delivery and no child have been affected.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Llorca","author_inst":"Universidad de Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Carolina Lechosa-Muniz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Gortazar","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandez-Ortiz","author_inst":"IDIVAL, Santander, Spain"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Jubete","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria J Cabero-Perez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ivan F.N.

Mitigating virus spread could benefit from reliable predictive models that inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection that underwrite ongoing social and healthcare strategies. Formally, the problem at hand is not unlike the one faced in neuroscience when modelling brain dynamics in terms of the activity of a neural network: the recent COVID19 pandemic develops in epicenters (e.g. cities or regions) and diffuses through transmission channels (e.g., population fluxes). Indeed, the analytic framework known as \"Dynamic Causal Modeling\" (DCM) has recently been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the mechanisms and latent factors driving its evolution. The DCM approach rests on a time-series generative model that provides - through Bayesian model inversion and inference - estimates of the factors underlying the progression of the pandemic. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, which were the first areas in Europe to contend with the COVID-19 outbreak. We used official data on the number of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and performed tests. The model - parameterized using data from the first months of the pandemic phase - was able to accurately predict its subsequent evolution (including social mobility, as assessed through GPS monitoring, and seroprevalence, as assessed through serologic testing) and revealed the potential factors underlying regional heterogeneity. Importantly, the model predicts that a second wave could arise due to a loss of effective immunity after about 7 months. This second wave was predicted to be substantially worse if outbreaks are not promptly isolated and contained. In short, dynamic causal modelling appears to be a reliable tool to shape and predict the spread of the COVID-19, and to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently counteract its second wave, until effective vaccines become available.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Gandolfi","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Pagnoni","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Filippini","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Alessia Goffi","author_inst":"TerraAria"},{"author_name":"Marco Vinceti","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Egidio Ugo D'Angelo","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Mapelli","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Judith Breuer","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Frank Kloprogge","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Joseph F.

Whatever the strategy, the role of health care workers is pivotal. We undertook this study to assess knowledge of COVID'19 and perception of the response to the pandemic among the staff of a regional hospital in charge of COVID'19 patients in West Cameroon. Methods We used a convenience non probabilistic sampling method to carry out a survey with a self administered questionnaire from April 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020 at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (BRH). All the staff was invited to participate. Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Epi Info version 7.1.5.2 software. Results Response rate was 76.1% (464\/610). Mean age (SD) and average work experience (SD) were 35.0 (8.9) and 8.4 (7.4) years respectively. Sex ratio (M\/F) was 101\/356. Nursing and midwifery staff (56.8%) and in patients units (49.94%) were predominant. Knowledge on origin and transmission of SARS'CoV'2 was poor but knowledge of clinical signs and the role of laboratory tests were good. 53.2% of respondents said all therapeutic regimens are only supportive and only a third of them trusted drugs recommended by health authorities. For 36.9% of respondents, herbal remedies can prevent\/cure COVID'19. 70% of staffs felt they were not knowledgeable enough to handle COVID'19 cases. 85.6% of respondents thought the BRH had insufficient resources to adequately respond to COVID'19 and 55.6% were dissatisfied with its response to the pandemic (weaknesses: medicines\/technologies (74.5%), service delivery (28.1%), human resource (10.9%)). 68% of staff felt insufficiently protected on duty and 76.5% reported that the pandemic significantly reduced non-COVID-19 services. 85.5% said they complied with preventive measures while in the community. For 44% of respondents Cameroonian regulations on COVID'19 corpses should be made more culture sensitive. 51.2% of respondents were against vaccine trial in their community.

The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we described that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake, including CD36, SREBP-1, PPAR{gamma} and DGAT-1 in monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cells. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA in infected cells. Pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Taken together, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic reprograming and LD formation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, opening new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suelen S.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, which makes manipulating it relatively difficult due to its infectious nature. To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with antibody titers determined from an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The CRNT, which used whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result, the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA. In conclusion, the CRNT for COVID-19 is a convenient assay system that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with high specificity and sensitivity for evaluating the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hideki Tani","author_inst":"Toyama Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Long Tan","author_inst":"University of Toyama"},{"author_name":"Miyuki Kimura","author_inst":"University of Toyama"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Yoshida","author_inst":"University of Toyama"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Yamada","author_inst":"University of Toyama"},{"author_name":"Shuetsu Fukushi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Saijo","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan."},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Kawasuji","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Akitoshi Ueno","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuki Miyajima","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yasutaka Fukui","author_inst":"University of Toyama"},{"author_name":"Ippei Sakamaki","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Yamamoto","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yoshitomo Morinaga","author_inst":"Nagasaki University"},{"author_name":"Dumith C Bou-Habib","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectology (INI), FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Thiago M L Souza","author_inst":"CDTS e Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Patricia T Bozza","author_inst":"Lab Imunofarmacologia, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"ZACHARIE SANDO","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"GEORGE ENOW ENOWNCHONG OROCK","author_inst":"Bafoussam Regional Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20177550","rel_title":"This time is different: model-based evaluation of the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics for disease control","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20177550","rel_abs":"As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic passes from an acute to a chronic situation, countries and territories are grappling with the issue of how to reopen safely. The unique kinetics of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, with its significant presymptomatic transmission, presents an unprecedented challenge to our intuitions. In this context, a generalizable quantitative understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on disease control strategies is vital. We used a previously published time-dependent model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (He et al., 2020) to parameterize an epidemiological model of transmission, which was then used to explore the effect of various disease control measures. Our analysis suggests that using symptom-based isolation alone as a control strategy is ineffective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, in contrast to its effectiveness in other diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Additionally, timeliness of testing and tracing strategies to reduce time to isolation, along with widespread adoption of measures to limit transmission are critical for any containment strategy. Our findings suggest that for symptom-based isolation and testing strategies to be effective, reduced transmission is required, reinforcing the importance of measures to limit transmission. From a public health strategy perspective, our findings lend support to the idea that symptomatic isolation should not form the primary basis for COVID-19 disease control.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaitlyn E Johnson","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Madison Stoddard","author_inst":"Fractal Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Ryan P Nolan","author_inst":"Halozyme Therapeutics, San Diego, CA"},{"author_name":"Douglas E White","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Natasha Hochberg","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arijit Chakravarty","author_inst":"Fractal Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Saijo","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan."},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Kawasuji","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Akitoshi Ueno","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuki Miyajima","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yasutaka Fukui","author_inst":"University of Toyama"},{"author_name":"Ippei Sakamaki","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Yamamoto","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yoshitomo Morinaga","author_inst":"Nagasaki University"},{"author_name":"Dumith C Bou-Habib","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectology (INI), FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Thiago M L Souza","author_inst":"CDTS e Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Patricia T Bozza","author_inst":"Lab Imunofarmacologia, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"ZACHARIE SANDO","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"GEORGE ENOW ENOWNCHONG OROCK","author_inst":"Bafoussam Regional Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20177188","rel_title":"Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in household and community settings in the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20177188","rel_abs":"Background: Households appear to be the highest risk setting for transmission of COVID-19. Large household transmission studies were reported in the early stages of the pandemic in Asia with secondary attack rates ranging from 5-30% but few large scale household transmission studies have been conducted outside of Asia. Methods: A prospective case ascertained study design based on the World Health Organization FFX protocol was undertaken in the UK following the detection of the first case in late January 2020. Household contacts of cases were followed using enhanced surveillance forms to establish whether they developed symptoms of COVID-19, became confirmed cases and their outcomes. Household secondary attack rates and serial intervals were estimated. Individual and household basic reproduction numbers were also estimated. The incubation period was estimated using known point source exposures that resulted in secondary cases. Results: A total of 233 households with two or more people were included with a total of 472 contacts. The overall household SAR was 37% (95% CI 31-43%) with a mean serial interval of 4.67 days, an R0 of 1.85 and a household reproduction number of 2.33. We find lower secondary attack rates in larger households. SARs were highest when the primary case was a child. We estimate a mean incubation period of around 4.5 days. Conclusions: High rates of household transmission of COVID-19 were found in the UK emphasising the need for preventative measures in this setting. Careful monitoring of schools reopening is needed to monitor transmission from children.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Chloe Byers","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Garcia Vilaplana","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nicola L Boddington","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"XuSheng Zhang","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Elgohari","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Coughlan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rosie Whillock","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sophie Logan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Hikaru Bolt","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Sinnathamby","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Louise Letley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Anderson","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karthik Paranthaman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Health Protection Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.22.20176669","rel_title":"A clinical MALDI-ToF Mass spectrometry assay for SARS-CoV-2: Rational design and multi-disciplinary team work.","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.22.20176669","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus has stretched national testing capacities to breaking points in almost all countries of the world. The need to rapidly screen vast numbers of a countrys population in order to control the spread of the infection is paramount. However, the logistical requirement for reagent supply (and associated cost) of RT-PCR based testing (the current front-line test) have been hugely problematic. Mass spectrometry-based methods using swab and gargle samples have been reported with promise, but have not approached the task from a systematic analysis of the entire diagnostic process. Here, the pipeline from sample processing, the biological characteristics of the pathogen in human biofluid, the downstream bio- and physical-chemistry and the all-important data processing with clinical interpretation and reporting, are carefully compiled into a single high throughput and reproducible rapid process. Utilizing MALDI-ToF mass spectrometric detection to viral envelope glycoproteins in a systems biology - multidisciplinary team approach, we have achieved a multifaceted clinical MALDI ToF MS screening test, primarily (but not limited to) SARS-CoV-2, with direct applicable to other future epidemics\/pandemics that may arise. The clinical information generated not only includes SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus detection (Spike protein fragments S1, S2b, S2a peaks), but other respiratory viral infections detected as well as an assessment of generalised oral upper respiratory immune response (elevated total Ig light chain peak) and a measure of the viral immune response (elevated intensity of IgA heavy chain peak). The advantages of the method include; 1) ease of sampling, 2) speed of analysis, and much reduced cost of testing. These features reveal the diagnostic utility of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry as a powerful and economically attractive global solution.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raymond Kruse Iles","author_inst":"MAP Sciences"},{"author_name":"Raminta Zmuidinaite","author_inst":"MAPSciences"},{"author_name":"Jason Kruse Iles","author_inst":"MAPSciences"},{"author_name":"George Carnell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexander Sampson","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Luke Heeney","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Elgohari","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Coughlan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rosie Whillock","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sophie Logan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Hikaru Bolt","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Sinnathamby","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Louise Letley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Anderson","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karthik Paranthaman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Health Protection Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.21.254995","rel_title":"Ferrets not infected by SARS-CoV-2 in a high-exposure domestic setting","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.21.254995","rel_abs":"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and onward transmission.

We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on RT-PCR and ELISA. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein (Spike) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that ACE2 provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1\/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin activity. These data support that host factors interacting with the novel S1\/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. This may be overcome in laboratory settings using concentrated viral inoculum, but the effects of ferret host-adaptations require additional investigation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaitlin Sawatzki","author_inst":"Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University"},{"author_name":"Nichola J.

Healthcare workers adherence to prevention and control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we assessed the KAP among healthcare workers towards COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. Method A self-developed piloted KAP questionnaire was used among the recruited healthcare workers working for the COVID-19 response in the Universal College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (UCMSTH), in Bhairahawa, Nepal. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of questions regarding the clinical characteristics, prevention and management of COVID-19. Assessment on attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on behaviour and change in practices while working during this response. Knowledge scores were calculated and compared by demographic characteristics and their attitude and practices towards COVID-19. Data were analysed using bivariate statistics. Results A total of 103 healthcare workers participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 28.24(6.11) years (range: 20-56); 60.2% were females; 61.2% were unmarried; 60.2% had medical degree and 39.8% were nursing staff. The mean knowledge score was 10.59(1.12) (range: 7-13) and it did not vary by demographic characteristics. Attitude was positive for 53.4% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.35(1.19) and negative for 46.6% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.88(0.98) (p=0.02). Practice was good ([&ge;]3 score) for 81.5% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.73(1.12) and practice was poor for 18.5% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.46(1.13) (p=0.24). The attitude of the participants improved with the increasing age of the participants (29.55(7.17), p=0.02). Conclusion There is comparably better knowledge regarding COVID-19 among healthcare workers along with appropriate practices, however attitude was less optimistic with better knowledge but more optimistic with higher age of the healthcare workers. Hence, protective measures for healthcare workers in order to improve their attitude is necessary during the pandemic response.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dil K Limbu","author_inst":"Universal College of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rano M Piryani","author_inst":"Universal College of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Avinash K Sunny","author_inst":"Golden Community"},{"author_name":"Alexa D.

Objective: Comparison of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with those of influenza patients in previous seasons at the same hospital Design: Admission rates, clinical measurements, and clinical outcomes from confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 1 and April 30, 2020 were compared with those from confirmed influenza cases in the previous five influenza seasons (8 months each) beginning September 1, 2014. Setting: Large tertiary care teaching hospital in Boston, Massachusetts Participants: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and influenza inpatients Measurements: Patient demographics and medical history, mortality, incidence and duration of mechanical ventilation, incidences of vasopressor support and renal replacement therapy, hospital and intensive care admissions. Results: Data was abstracted from medical records of 1052 influenza patients and 583 COVID-19 patients. An average of 210 hospital admissions for influenza occurred per 8-month season compared to 583 COVID-19 admissions over two months. The median weekly number of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 17 (IQR: 4, 34) compared to a weekly median of 1 (IQR: 0, 2) influenza patient (p=0.001). COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation (31% vs 8%), and had significantly higher mortality (20% vs. 3%; p<0.001 for all). Relatively more COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation lacked pre-existing conditions compared with mechanically ventilated influenza patients (25% vs 4%, p<0.001). Limitation: This is a single-center study which could limit generalization. Conclusion: COVID-19 resulted in more hospitalizations, higher morbidity, and higher mortality than influenza at the same hospital.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael W.

Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single \"ensemble\" forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S. Methods Beginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths. Results Analysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96% of observations falling within the rounded 95% prediction intervals. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons. Careful development, assessment, and communication of ensemble forecasts can provide reliable insight to public health decision makers.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evan L Ray","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Nutcha Wattanachit","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Jarad Niemi","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Abdul Hannan Kanji","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Katie House","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Estee Y Cramer","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Johannes Bracher","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andrew Zheng","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Teresa K Yamana","author_inst":"Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Spencer Woody","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Yuanjia Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Lily Wang","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Robert L Walraven","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Vishal Tomar","author_inst":"Auquan Ltd"},{"author_name":"Katherine Sherratt","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041).

Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas City, KS as a proof of concept.   Results At TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral\/bacterial filter combination. Conclusion The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiv Dalla","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Shinde","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Jack M Ayres","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Waller","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Nachtigal","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yazhou He","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Maria Timofeeva","author_inst":"DIAS, Danish Institute for Advanced Study, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Harry Campbell","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Dunlop","author_inst":"Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lina Zgaga","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Population Health, Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Evropi Theodoratou","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Yuanjia Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Lily Wang","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Robert L Walraven","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Vishal Tomar","author_inst":"Auquan Ltd"},{"author_name":"Katherine Sherratt","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

The sudden spike in the number of infections and high mortality rates have put immense pressure on the public medical systems. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors of mortality that yield high accuracy and consistency to optimize patient treatment strategy. This study uses machine learning methods to identify a powerful combination of five features that help predict mortality with 96% accuracy: neutrophils, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and age. Various machine learning algorithms have been compared to achieve a consistent high accuracy across the days that span the disease. Robust testing with three cases confirm the strong predictive performance of the proposed model. The model predicts with an accuracy of 90% as early as 16 days before the outcome. This study would help accelerate the decision making process in healthcare systems for focused medical treatments early and accurately.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshaya Karthikeyan","author_inst":"Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Akshit Garg","author_inst":"Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"P K Vinod","author_inst":"Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"U.

However time of starting steroid and dose tailored to severity remains a matter of inquiry due to still emerging evidences and wide-ranging concerns of benefits and harms. We did a retrospective record analysis in an apex teaching hospital ICU setting to explore optimal doses and duration of steroid therapy which minimizes the hazard of death. Methodology: 114 adults with COVID19-ARDS admitted to ICU between 20thMarch-15thAugust2020 were included in chart review. We did preliminary exploratory analysis(rooted in steroid therapy matrix categorized by dose and duration) to understand the effect of several covariates on survival. This was followed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportion hazard regression analysis and model diagnostics. Results: Exploratory analysis and visualization indicated age, optimal steroid, severity (measured in P\/F) of disease and infection status as potential covariates for survival. Univariate cox regression analysis showed significant positive association of age>60 years{2.6 (1.5-4.7)} and protective effect of optimum steroid{0.38(0.2-0.72)} on death (hazard) in critically ill patients. Multivariate cox regression analysis after adjusting effect of age showed protective effect of optimum steroid on hazard defined as death {0.46(0.23-0.87),LR=17.04,(p=2e-04)}.The concordance was 0.70 and model diagnostics fulfilled the assumption criteria for proportional hazard model. Conclusion: Optimal dose steroid as per defined optimum(<24 hours and doses tailored to P\/F at presentation) criteria can offer protective effect from mortality which persists after adjusting for age. This protective effect was not found to be negatively influenced by the risk of infection.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhishek Goyal","author_inst":"All India INstitute of Medical Sciences Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Saigal","author_inst":"All India institute of medical sciences Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Ankur Joshi","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Dodda Brahmam","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Yogesh Niwariya","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Alkesh Khurana","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Pooja Singh","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Sunaina Tejpal Karna","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Jaiprakash Sharma","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"G Sai Pavan Jr.","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Sagar Khadanga","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Arun Mitra","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Mehmet DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Erciyes University"},{"author_name":"Filiz BASINOGLU","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Darica Farabi Teaching and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nurhan SEYAHI","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa"},{"author_name":"Gizem DINLER DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Levent DOGANAY","author_inst":"University of Health Sciences, Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly evolving pandemic causing great morbimortality. Medical therapy with hydroxicloroquine, azitromycin and protease inhibitors is being empirically used, with reported data of QTc interval prolongation. Our aim is to assess QT interval behaviour in a not critically ill and not monitored cohort of patients. Design. We evaluated admitted and ambulatory patients with COVID-19 patients with 12 lead electrocardiogram at 48 hours after treatment initiation. Other clinical and analytical variables were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the magnitude of the QT interval prolongation under treatment and to identify clinical, analytical and electrocardiographic risk markers of QT prolongation independent predictors. Results. We included 219 patients (mean age of 63.6 +\/- 17.4 years, 48.9% were women and 16.4% were outpatients. The median baseline QTc was 416 ms (IQR 404-433), and after treatment QTc was prolonged to 423 ms (405-438) (P < 0.001), with an average increase of 1.8%. Most of the patients presented a normal QTc under treatment, with only 31 cases (14,1 %) showing a QTc interval > 460 ms, and just one case with QTc > 500 ms. Advanced age, longer QTc basal at the basal ECG and lower potassium levels were independent predictors of QTc interval prolongation. Conclusions. Ambulatory and not critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and\/or antiretrovirals develop a significant, but not relevant, QT interval prolongation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan J Jaimez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Rosa Macias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Francisco Bermudez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rubini","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alvarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Luis Tercedor","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Juan Diego Mediavilla","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Jessica Ramirez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Concepcino Morales","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Paula Flores","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves"},{"author_name":"Sagar Khadanga","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Arun Mitra","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Mehmet DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Erciyes University"},{"author_name":"Filiz BASINOGLU","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Darica Farabi Teaching and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nurhan SEYAHI","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa"},{"author_name":"Gizem DINLER DOGANAY","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Levent DOGANAY","author_inst":"University of Health Sciences, Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert C Reiner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"B.

The Val308 - Gly548 of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 linked with Gln830 - Glu843 of Tetanus toxoid (TT peptide) (designated as S1-4) and without TT peptide (designated as S1-5), and prokaryotic expression, chromatography purification and the rational renaturation of the protein were performed. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of S1-4 protein was evaluated by Western Blotting (WB) in vitro and immune responses in mice, respectively. The protective efficiency of it was measured by virus neutralization test in Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2. S1-4 protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity by prokaryotic expression and chromatography purification. Adjuvanted with Alum, S1-4 protein stimulated a strong antibody response in immunized mice and caused a major Th2-type cellular immunity compared with S1-5 protein. Furthermore, the immunized sera could protect the Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection with neutralization antibody GMT 256. The candidate subunit vaccine molecule could stimulate strong humoral and Th1 and Th2-type cellular immune response in mice, giving us solid evidence that S1-4 protein could be a promising subunit vaccine candidate.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiudong Su","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yening Zou","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Yao Yi","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Liping Shen","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiangzhong Ye","author_inst":"Beijing WanTai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Hong Ke","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Jingdong Song","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Keping Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bolin Cheng","author_inst":"Jianxuan Business Center"},{"author_name":"Feng Qiu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenting Zhou","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lei Cao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shengli Bi","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zheng","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.21.261404","rel_title":"Functional and druggability analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome","rel_date":"2020-08-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.21.261404","rel_abs":"The infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread worldwide. As of today, more than 22 million people have been infected, with almost 800,000 fatalities. With the purpose of contributing to the development of effective therapeutics, this work provides an overview of the viral machinery and functional role of each SARS-CoV-2 protein, and a thorough analysis of the structure and druggability assessment of the viral proteome. All structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied, and whenever experimental structural data of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not available, homology models were built based on solved SARS-CoV structures. Several potential allosteric or protein-protein interaction druggable sites on different viral targets were identified, knowledge that could be used to expand current drug discovery endeavors beyond the cysteine proteases and the polymerase complex. It is our hope that this study will support the efforts of the scientific community both in understanding the molecular determinants of this disease and in widening the repertoire of viral targets in the quest for repurposed or novel drugs against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio N Cavasotto","author_inst":"Translational Medicine Research Institute (IIMT), CONICET-Universidad Austral"},{"author_name":"Maximiliano S\u00e1nchez Lamas","author_inst":"Universidad Austral"},{"author_name":"Juli\u00e1n Maggini","author_inst":"Technology Transfer Office, Universidad Austral"},{"author_name":"Liping Shen","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiangzhong Ye","author_inst":"Beijing WanTai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Hong Ke","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Jingdong Song","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Keping Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bolin Cheng","author_inst":"Jianxuan Business Center"},{"author_name":"Feng Qiu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenting Zhou","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lei Cao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shengli Bi","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"George Fu Gao","author_inst":"National Institute For Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jerry Zheng","author_inst":"Artron Bioresearch Inc."},{"author_name":"Dave Osthus","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michael Lingzhi Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ugur Koyluoglu","author_inst":"Oliver Wyman"},{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Youyang Gu","author_inst":"unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Quanquan Gu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Glover E George","author_inst":"US Army Engineer Research and Development Center"},{"author_name":"Guido Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Corsetti","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jagpreet Chhatwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Hannah Biegel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc"},{"author_name":"Jo Walker","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Rachel Slayton","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Velma Lopez","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Matthew Biggerstaff","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael A Johansson","author_inst":"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Reich","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Forecast Hub Consortium","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"}]}
