While the 26-nucleotide deletion variant was only found in one sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5\/9 patients sequenced and one health care worker with samples collected between April 2nd and 9th, 2020. Both the presence of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant limited to this unit and the clustering of the corresponding whole genome sequences by phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission between patients. Interestingly, prolonged viral excretion of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was identified in a stool sample 14 days after initial diagnosis for one patient. Clinical data revealed no significant difference in disease severity between patients harboring the wild-type or the 34-nucleotide deletion variants. The in vitro infection of the two deletion variants on primate endothelial kidney cells (BGM) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) yielded comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, high viral loads were found in vivo regardless of the presence or absence of the ORF6 deletion. Our study highlights the transmission and replication capacity of two newly described deletion variants in the same ORF6 region.\n\nImportanceWhile the SARS-CoV-2 genome has remained relatively stable since its emergence in the human population, genomic deletions are an evolutionary pattern previously described for the related SARS-CoV. Real-time genomic monitoring of the circulating variants is paramount to detect strain prevalence and transmission dynamics. Given the role of ORF6 in interferon modulation, further characterization, such as mechanistic interactions and interferon monitoring in patients, is crucial in understanding the viral-host factors driving disease evolution.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gregory Queromes","author_inst":"CIRI (Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie)"},{"author_name":"Gregory Destras","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Regue","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Gwendolyne Burfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Solenne Brun","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Remi Fanget","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20161067","rel_title":"A Long-Lasting Sanitizing Skin Protectant based on CAGE, a Choline and Geranic Acid Eutectic","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20161067","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak and rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and a massive public health crisis. COVID-19 has also had a severe impact on the quality of life and mental health. While different health authorities such as WHO and CDC are encouraging adoption of strategies including hand washing and use of facemasks to reduce the spread of the pathogens and infections, adoption of these approaches requires substantial commitment. Current hand sanitizers based on ethanol provide immediate protection, however, the protection rendered by such sanitizers is very short-lived due to their rapid evaporation. A long-lasting sanitizing skin protectant that can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and provide persistent efficacy over several hours will provide people the freedom to carry on with their activities without constant concerns about the cleanliness of their hands. Herein, we describe a skin protectant, IonLASTTM, based on an ionic liquid\/deep eutectic solvent, formed by GRAS materials, choline and geranic acid (CAGE, CG-101), that provides protection for at least 4h after a single application. IonLASTTM was formulated as a gel that facilitates easy application on the skin. Tolerance of CG-101 was substantiated through a study in human volunteers. In vitro studies confirmed that IonLASTTM effectively inactivates a human coronavirus hCoV229E. A second human clinical study established that a single application of IonLASTTM imparts protection against microbes that lasts up to several hours.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marina Shevachman","author_inst":"CAGE Bio Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhirup Mandal","author_inst":"CAGE Bio Inc."},{"author_name":"Samir Mitragotri","author_inst":"John A.

Study design: This retrospective analysis of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and IgG antibody at a quaternary-care, free-standing pediatric hospital between March 13th, 2020 to June 21st, 2020 included 6369 patients who underwent PCR testing and 215 patients who underwent antibody testing. During the initial study period, testing focused primarily on symptomatic children; the later study period included asymptomatic patients who underwent testing as preadmission or preprocedural screening. We report the proportion of positive and negative tests, time to viral clearance, and time to seropositivity. Results: The rate of positivity varied over time due to viral circulation in the community and transition from targeted testing of symptomatic patients to more universal screening of hospitalized patients. Median duration of viral shedding (RT-PCR positivity) was 19.5 days and RT-PCR negativity from positivity was 25 days. Of note, patients aged 6 to 15 years demonstrated a longer period of RT-PCR negativity from positivity, compared to patients aged 16 to 22 years (median=32 versus 18 days, p=0.015). Median time to seropositivity from RT-PCR positivity was 18 days while median time to reach adequate levels of neutralizing antibodies (defined as equivalent to 160 titer) was 36 days. Conclusions: The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged period of viral shedding after infection with SARS CoV-2. Whether this correlates with persistent infectivity is unknown. Only 17 of 33 patients demonstrated neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that some patients may not mount significant immune responses to infection. It remains unknown if IgG antibody production correlates with immunity and how long measurable antibodies persist and protect against future infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burak Bahar","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cyril Jacquot","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunchuan Delores Mo","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roberta DeBiasi","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meghan Delaney","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Solenne Brun","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Remi Fanget","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20160515","rel_title":"The association between lockdown due to COVID-19 epidemic and searches for toothache using Google Trends in Iran","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20160515","rel_abs":"Objective: To assess the association between the lockdowns due to COVID-19 and online searches for toothache in Iran using Google Trends (GT). Methods: We investigated GT online searches for the search term   within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of lockdown in Iran. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to identify whether there is a statistical difference for RSV scores between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water with linear regression. A p-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: When comparing 2020 with previous four years, there is a statistically significant difference between RSVs of 2020 with all previous years combined and each of these years (P<0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B=-3.29, 95% CI: (-5.80, -0.78), P=0.012), fluoride concentration (B=-0.13, 95% CI: (-0.24, -0.03), P=0.017), and prevalence of daily smokers (B=0.33, 95% CI: (0.13, 0.53), P=0.002) were significantly associated with RSVs. These covariates were not statistically significant for other years, except for Internet access in 2016 (B=-1.13, 95% CI: (-2.26, 0.00), P=0.050). Conclusion: The RSVs for toothache in 2020 have significantly increased due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns compared to the same period of the year in the past four years. knowing that this period mostly overlaps with the national holidays of Nowruz in Iran, reinforces the impacts of lockdowns on people CSB about toothache. In the subnational scale, the RSVs were significantly correlated with HDI, fluoride concentration, and number of daily smokers which emphasizes the role of socioeconomic factors in dental health and care-seeking behaviour.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Sofi-Mahmudi","author_inst":"Cochrane Iran Associate Centre, National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Erfan Shamsoddin","author_inst":"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Peyman Ghasemi","author_inst":"Department of Health Economics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ali Mehrabi Bahar","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mansour Shaban Azad","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Shahid Chamran Heart Educational, Medical and Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ghasem Sadeghi","author_inst":"Bureau of Dentistry, Vice Chancellery for Treatment, Ministry of Health and Education, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Remi Fanget","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"dentistry and oral medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169896","rel_title":"Prediction of Covid-19 Infections Through December 2020 for 10 US States Using a Two Parameter Transmission Model Incorporating Outdoor Temperature and School Re-Opening Effects","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169896","rel_abs":"Covid-19 infection case predictions (total cases) are made for August through December 2020 for 10 US States (NY, WA, GA, IL, MN, FL, OH, MI, CA, and NC). A two-parameter model based on social distance index (SDI) and disease transmission efficiency (G) parameters is used to characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease spread. Current lack of coherent and coordinated US policy causes the US to follow a linear infection growth path with a limit cycle behavior that modulates the US between accelerating and decaying infection growth on either side of a linear growth path boundary. Four prediction cases are presented: 1) No school re-openings; fall season temperature effect 2) No school re-openings; no fall season temperature effect 3) School re-openings; fall season temperature effect 4) School re-openings; no fall season temperature effect Fall outdoor temperatures, in contrast to the 1918 pandemic, are predicted to be beneficial for dampening SARS-CoV-2 transmission in States as they pass through swing season temperature range of 70F to 50F. Physical re-opening of schools in September are predicted to accelerate infections. States with low current infectious case numbers (eg, NY) are predicted to be minimally impacted while States with high current infectious case numbers (eg, CA and FL) will be significantly impacted by school re-openings. Updated infection predictions will be posted monthly (Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec) with adjustments based on actual trends in SDI and G.

No versatile web app exists that allows epidemiologists and managers around the world to fully analyze the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation. The NMB-DASA web app presented here fills this gap. Methods. Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies a contact class of individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic classes and a parallel set of response class, subject to lower contact pathogen contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file containing incidence and mortality time series. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a subset of these can be fitted to the model using an MLE algorithm. The end of model-fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allows counterfactual and forecasted scenarios to be explored. Findings. We illustrate the app in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, which can be divided into four distinct phases: an initial outbreak; a social distancing, a social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. Our projections beyond the relaxation phase indicate that an 85% drop in social relaxation rates are needed just to stabilize the current incidence rate and that at least a 95% drop is needed to quell the outbreak. Interpretation. Our analysis uses only incidence and mortality rates. In the hands of policy makers and health officers, we believe our web app provides an invaluable tool for evaluating the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wayne M.

We reviewed the clinical course, key laboratory data including acute phase reactants, drug\/medication history in two elderly male patients admitted for COVID-19 respiratory failure. Both patients had a complicated clinical course and suffered from hematochezia and acute blood loss anemia requiring blood transfusion around day 40 of their hospitalization. Colonoscopic impressions were correlated with the histopathological findings in the colonic biopies and changes compatible with ischemia to nonspecific acute inflammation, edema and increased eosinophils in the lamina propria were noted.Both patients were on anticoagulants, multiple antibiotics and antifungal agents due to respiratory infections at the time of lower GI bleeding. Hematochezia resolved spontaneously with supportive care. Both patients eventually recovered and were discharged. Elderly patients with significant comorbid conditions are uniquely at risk for ischemic injury to the bowel. Hypoxic conditions due to COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure, compounded by preexisting cardiovascular complications, and\/or cytokine storm orchestrated by the viral infection leading to alteration in coagulation profile and\/or drug\/medication injury can be difficult to distinguish in these critically ill patients.

However, there is a lack of regarding comprehensive stroke phenotype and characteristics Methods: We conducted a multinational observational study on features of consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and cerebral venous or sinus thrombosis (CVST) among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We further investigated the association of demographics, clinical data, geographical regions, and countrie's health expenditure among AIS patients with the risk of large vessel occlusion (LVO), stroke severity as measured by National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), and stroke subtype as measured by the TOAST criteria. Additionally, we applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms to uncover possible similarities among stroke patients. Results: Among the 136 tertiary centers of 32 countries who participated in this study, 71 centers from 17 countries had at least one eligible stroke patient. Out of 432 patients included, 323(74.8%) had AIS, 91(21.1%) ICH, and 18(4.2%) CVST. Among 23 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 16(69.5%) had no evidence of aneurysm. A total of 183(42.4%) patients were women, 104(24.1%) patients were younger than 55 years, and 105(24.4%) patients had no identifiable vascular risk factors. Among 380 patients who had known interval onset of the SARS-CoV-2 and stroke, 144(37.8%) presented to the hospital with chief complaints of stroke-related symptoms, with asymptomatic or undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among AIS patients 44.5% had LVO; 10% had small artery occlusion according to the TOAST criteria. We observed a lower median NIHSS (8[3-17], versus 11[5-17]; p=0.02) and higher rate of mechanical thrombectomy (12.4% versus 2%; p<0.001) in countries with middle to high-health expenditure when compared to countries with lower health expenditure. The unsupervised machine learning identified 4 subgroups, with a relatively large group with no or limited comorbidities. Conclusions: We observed a relatively high number of young, and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among stroke patients. Traditional vascular risk factors were absent among a relatively large cohort of patients. Among hospitalized patients, the stroke severity was lower and rate of mechanical thrombectomy was higher among countries with middle to high-health expenditure.","rel_num_authors":113,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shima Shahjouei","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Georgios Tsivgoulis","author_inst":"Second Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Attikon University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ghasem Farahmand","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Eric Koza","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ashkhan Mowla","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Alireza Vafaei Sadr","author_inst":"Department de Physique Theorique and Center for Astroparticle Physics, University Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Arash Kia","author_inst":"Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Institute for Healthcare Delivery Science, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Vaghefi Far","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Tehran University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Stefania Mondello","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphofunctional Imaging, University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Achille Cernigliaro","author_inst":"Regional Health Authority of Sicily"},{"author_name":"Annemarei Ranta","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Wellington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin Punter","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Wellington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Faezeh Khodadadi","author_inst":"PES university,bengalore,India"},{"author_name":"Mrina Sabra","author_inst":"Lebanese University\/Medical School, NRC (Neurosciences Research Center)"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

We present here the validation and implementation of such a workflow for preparing samples for downstream SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using liquid handling robots. The rapid sample preparation technique evaluated, which included sample centrifugation and heating prior to RT-PCR, showed a 97.37% (95% CI: 92.55-99.28%) positive percent agreement and 97.30% (95% CI: 90.67-99.52%) negative percent agreement compared to nucleic acid purification-based testing.

Here we quantify how levels of these antibodies change in the months following SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining longitudinal samples collected between {approx}30 and 152 days post-symptom onset from a prospective cohort of 34 recovered individuals with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate-severe disease. Neutralizing antibody titers declined an average of about four-fold from one to four months post-symptom onset. Importantly, our data are consistent with the expected early immune response to viral infection, where an initial peak in antibody levels is followed by a decline to a lower plateau. Additional studies of long-lived B-cells and antibody titers over longer time frames are necessary to determine the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katharine HD Crawford","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Adam S Dingens","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel Eguia","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Naomi Wilcox","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Logue","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kiel Shuey","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda M Casto","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands, music classes, etc.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruichen He","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Linyue Gao","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Trifonov","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jiarong Hong","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Naomi Wilcox","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Logue","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kiel Shuey","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda M Casto","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

The exponent {lambda} of the exponential function expressing the number of newly tested positive persons was defined as an linear equation explicitly with three important parameters, transmission coefficient, social distancing ratio x and isolation rate q. In this study, applying this model to the number of positive persons in publicly available database, daily {lambda} values are regression analyzed, and social distancing ratio and isolation rate are derived. Analyses for 7 countries including Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and western countries are performed and determine the dynamic locus of q-x relation on the q-x plane during epidemic propagation. Finally, the remaining parameter, the transmission coefficient is shown to closely relate to the maximum {lambda}, {lambda}max, and {lambda}max (transmission coefficient) is characterized as a specific value for each country. Then, the magnitude of {lambda}max is combined with the value of {lambda}min to influence the total number of new cases until the convergence stage.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Koichi Hashiguchi","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Linyue Gao","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Trifonov","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jiarong Hong","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Naomi Wilcox","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Logue","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kiel Shuey","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda M Casto","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods: In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralization test, and a neutralization assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results: From baseline to week six, n=1,080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from n=217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4 % in week six, p<0.001). In sera of convalescent PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from ELISAs using e.g. the S1 spike protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralization. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the six week study period. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralization against live SARS CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion: When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Georg MN Behrens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anne Cossmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Metodi V Stankov","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bianca Schulte","author_inst":"University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University Bonn"},{"author_name":"Reinhold Foerster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Berislav Bosnjak","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Willenzon","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anna-Lena Boeck","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anh Thu Tran","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thea Thiele","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Theresa Graalmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Moritz Z.

Aims: To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. Methods: We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on the national health insurance data. Each patient with a mental or behavioral disorder (diagnosed during six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index with up to four patients without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk and risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 230,565 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33,653 (14.6%) had mental disorders, 928\/33,653 (2.76%) tested positive, and 56\/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariate analysis with the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.12); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81). Among confirmed cases, mortality risk significantly increased in patients with mental disorders (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 1.07-3.15). Conclusion: Mental disorders are likely contributing factors of mortality following COVID-19. Although the infection risk did not increase in overall mental disorders, patients with schizophrenia-related disorders were more vulnerable to the infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ha-Lim Jeon","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Soo Kwon","author_inst":"Seoul National University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"So-Hee Park","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Ju-Young Shin","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University Bonn"},{"author_name":"Reinhold Foerster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Berislav Bosnjak","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Willenzon","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anna-Lena Boeck","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anh Thu Tran","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thea Thiele","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Theresa Graalmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Moritz Z.

Amazonian States have a much higher contamination rate than the southern and southeastern States. So far, no explanation has been provided for this striking difference that can shed light on the airborne transmission of the virus. Minimizing airborne transmission, health authorities recommend two meters as a safe distance. However, recent experiments reveal that this can be the main form of contagion. There is a lack of theoretical explanation on how airborne transmission works. Methods To investigate the spread of SARS-COV-2 in different macro environments, we analyzed the daily official data on the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. We compared our epidemiologic results obtained in States with very different climatic characteristics, and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. To understand the virus spread, it was necessary to calculate theoretically the movement and behavior in the air of saliva droplets. Findings The transmission of SARS-COV-2 is much faster in the Amazon rainforest region. Our theoretical calculations explain and support the empirical results observed in recent experiments that demonstrate the relevance of aerial transmission of the coronavirus. Interpretation An onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population. If confirmed, this result will have an essential impact on the management of the pandemic across the planet. The airborne transmission played a decisive role in the striking difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions. Air humidity is the most important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have strong influence. There is no safe indoor distance for the coronavirus transmission. So, mask and eye protection are essential.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edilson Crema","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jun Soo Kwon","author_inst":"Seoul National University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"So-Hee Park","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Ju-Young Shin","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University Bonn"},{"author_name":"Reinhold Foerster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Berislav Bosnjak","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Willenzon","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anna-Lena Boeck","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anh Thu Tran","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thea Thiele","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Theresa Graalmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Moritz Z.

Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. Methods: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 821 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (237) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (584). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. Results: Decedents were more likely to be male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) than the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (89% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions: Disease surveillance through medical examiners and coroners could supplement other forms of surveillance and may serve as a possible early outbreak warning sign.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew F.

It is known that wearing PPE, and specifically face masks, has physcial consequences like headache and pain, which can increase stress among nursing staff. However, none of these studies placed a focus on PPE and nursing staff, although nurses are the only members of the health care profession who are at the patients bedsides 24\/7, and PPE is the only way to protect them from a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the association between the use of PPE and stress among nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted, which we distributed using snowball sampling techniques. The questionnaire was developed on the basis of (inter-)national recommendations as well as the international literature. We used the perceived level of stress scale to measure the nursing staff members stress levels. Results We included data collected from 2600 nurses in this analysis. Nearly all nursing staff wore face masks. We showed that more than two-thirds of the nurses had moderate to high levels of stress. No statistically significant association between the use of PPE and stress was detected. However, we show a statistically significant association between the duration of mask usage and stress. Discussion and conclusions Nearly all participating nurses wore face masks or FFP masks to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection. This observation might indicate that Austrian nurses display a high level of compliance with national and international regulations and play a key role in such pandemics. Our results also show that increased mask-wearing time led to increased stress levels. These results suggest that (inter-)national regulations on how and when to use PPE should include a maximum duration of time for wearing each type of mask. Such regulations could help to prevent work-related stress, particularly in the case of future epidemics, and avoid burnout among nursing staff or even nurses leaving their jobs. The consequences of both of these negative outcomes should be considered in light of the predicted expected future shortage of health care workers.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuela Hoedl","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Sience, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Doris Eglseer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Sience, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bauer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Sience, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Pavle Vrljicak","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Richard Stark","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Sascha Ott","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Paul G Murray","author_inst":"University of Birmingham and University of Limerick"},{"author_name":"Eslam Al-abadi","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashish Chikermane","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Dawson","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Jyothish","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Hari Krishnan Kanthimathinathan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Sean Monaghan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens hospital NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Prasad Nagakumar","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Barnaby R Scholefield","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Kearns","author_inst":"NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre and Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Graham Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Diana Ernst","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Jablonka","author_inst":"Hannover Medical  School"},{"author_name":"Christine Happle","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Usually detection of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time RT-PCR method, but it must be long time that RNA is treated by extraction, concentration and purification, and detected by RT-PCR method. We modified various methods, of which evaluated if each method is short and simple enough. In one point of the evaluations, real-time RT-PCR could be finished in very short time with using mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100 (Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.). It was able to detect positive control RNA for 20 minutes by each method according to the National Institute of Infections Disease in Japan (NIID), and less than 13.5 minutes according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in USA (CDC). In another point of the evaluations, surprisingly, Human coronavirus 229E, which was substituted for SARS-CoV-2, could be detected in crude state without treatment in advance of RNA. As that was, it was possible to detect coronavirus with direct RT-PCR. Therefore, it might eliminate wasteful time, avoid secondary infection and risk of contamination. In light of the above two points, SARS-CoV-2 might be detected more quickly and more simply. With using this mobile real-time PCR, these methods should be suitable for not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other various viruses and might save time compared to earlier detection methods.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Masaaki Muraoka","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"Yukiko Tanoi","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"Tetsutaro Tada","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"MIkio Mizukoshi","author_inst":"Certified Non-Profit Organization Biomedical Science Association, Japan"},{"author_name":"Osamu Kawaguchi","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"Sascha Ott","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Paul G Murray","author_inst":"University of Birmingham and University of Limerick"},{"author_name":"Eslam Al-abadi","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashish Chikermane","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Dawson","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Jyothish","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Hari Krishnan Kanthimathinathan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Sean Monaghan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens hospital NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Prasad Nagakumar","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Barnaby R Scholefield","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Kearns","author_inst":"NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre and Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Graham Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Diana Ernst","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Jablonka","author_inst":"Hannover Medical  School"},{"author_name":"Christine Happle","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

To understand the genetic link between aging and the risk of COVID-19, we conducted a multi-instrument Mendelian randomization analysis and found that the genetic variation that leads to a longer lifespan is significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection. The odds ratio is 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.57; P = 1.3 x 10-4) per additional 10 years of life, and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.77; P = 7.2 x 10-6) per unit higher log odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. On the other hand, there was no association between COVID-19 susceptibility and healthspan (the lifespan free of the top seven age-related morbidities). To examine the relationship at the phenotypic level, we applied various biological aging clock models and detected an association between the biological age acceleration and future incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection for all subjects as well as for the individuals free of chronic disease. Biological age acceleration was also significantly associated with the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest a causal relationship between aging and COVID-19, defined by genetic variance, the rate of aging, and the burden of chronic diseases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kejun Ying","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ranran Zhai","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Timothy V Pyrkov","author_inst":"Gero LLC PTE"},{"author_name":"Marco Mariotti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Peter O Fedichev","author_inst":"Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xia Shen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University, University of Edinburgh, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Vadim N Gladyshev","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Eslam Al-abadi","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashish Chikermane","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Dawson","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Jyothish","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Hari Krishnan Kanthimathinathan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Sean Monaghan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens hospital NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Prasad Nagakumar","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Barnaby R Scholefield","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Kearns","author_inst":"NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre and Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Graham Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Diana Ernst","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Jablonka","author_inst":"Hannover Medical  School"},{"author_name":"Christine Happle","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Their thorough validation is of extreme importance before using them as epidemiological tools to infer population seroprevalence, and as complementary diagnostic tools to molecular approaches (e.g. RT-qPCR). Here we assayed commercial serological tests (semiquantitative and qualitative) from 11 suppliers in 126 samples collected from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and from 36 healthy and HIV-infected individuals (collected at the pre-COVID-19 pandemic). Specificity was above 95% in 9 tests. Samples from COVID-19 patients were stratified by days since symptoms onset (<10, 10-15, 16-21 and >21 days). Tests sensitivity increases with time since symptoms onset, and peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum: 91.2%); and from 16-21 to >21 days for IgG, depending on the test (maximum: 94.1%). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with severe clinical presentation have lower relative levels of IgM, IgA and IgG at <10 days since symptoms onset in comparison to patients with non-severe presentation. At >21 days since symptoms onset the relative levels of IgM and IgG (in one test) are significantly higher in patients with severe clinical presentation, suggesting a delay in the upsurge of Ig against SARS-CoV-2 in those patients. This study highlights the high specificity of most of the evaluated tests, and sensitivity heterogeneity. Considering the virus genetic evolution and population immune response to it, continuous monitoring of commercially available serological tests towards SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia Serre-Miranda","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

We evaluated the specificity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in prepandemic sample cohorts across five sites in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Methods: Specificity of the immunoassay was evaluated using anonymised, frozen, residual serum and\/or plasma samples from blood donors or routine diagnostic testing. All samples were collected before September 2019 and therefore presumed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cohorts included samples from blood donors, pregnant women and paediatric patients. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Overall specificities for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 9575 samples from blood donors (n = 6714) and diagnostic specimens (n = 2861) were 99.82% (95% CI 99.69-99.91) and 99.93% (95% CI 99.75-99.99), respectively. Among 2256 samples from pregnant women, specificity was 99.91% (95% CI 99.68-99.99). Among 205 paediatric samples, specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.22-100). Conclusion: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a very high specificity across blood donor samples and diagnostic specimens from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our findings support the use of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as a potential tool for determination of an immune response following previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the general population, including in blood donors, pregnant women and paediatric populations.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elena Riester","author_inst":"Labor Augsburg MVZ GmbH, Augsburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Beda Krieter","author_inst":"Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service West GmbH, Central Laboratory Hagen, Hagen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Peter Findeisen","author_inst":"MVZ Labor Limbach, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Laimighofer","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Schoenfeld","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tina Laengin","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregionale Blood Transfusion Swiss Red Cross, Bern, Switzerland; Institute for Infectious Diseases (IFIK), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pedro Alves-Peixoto","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

Moreover, in contrast to influenza, while most SARS-CoV-2 infected people do not transmit the virus to anybody, a small percentage secondarily infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza which link observed viral shedding patterns with key epidemiologic features of each virus, including distributions of the number of secondary cases attributed to each infected person (individual R0) and the duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person (serial interval). We identify that people with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infections are usually contagious for fewer than two days congruent with peak viral load several days after infection, and that transmission is unlikely below a certain viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events with over 10 secondary infections occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very high viral load and has a high concurrent number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events is not due to its 1-2 additional weeks of viral shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks than a person infected with influenza, likely due to aerosolization of virus. Our results support policies that limit crowd size in indoor spaces and provide viral load benchmarks for infection control and therapeutic interventions intended to prevent secondary transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Goyal","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel B Reeves","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"E.

Here, we examined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in 1808 asymptomatic individuals on a university campus in California, and compared for the first time the performance of CRISPR- and PCR-based assays for large-scale virus surveillance. Our study revealed that there were no COVID-19 cases in our study population in May\/June of 2020. Using the same methods, we demonstrated a substantial shift in prevalence approximately one month later, which coincided with changes in community restrictions and public interactions. This increase in prevalence, in a young and asymptomatic population, indicated the leading wave of a local outbreak, and reflected the rising case counts in the surrounding county. Our results substantiate that large, population-level asymptomatic screening using CRISPR- or PCR-based assays is a feasible and instructive aspect of the public health approach within large campus communities.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer N Rauch","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Eric Valois","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Jose Carlos Ponce-Rojas","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Zach Aralis","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan L Lach","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Francesca Zappa","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Morgane Audouard","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Sabrina C Solley","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Chinmay Vaidya","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Michael Costello","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Holly Smith","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Ali Javanbakht","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Betsy Malear","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Laura Polito","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Stewart Comer","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital; Pacific Diagnostic Laboratories, Santa Barbara,"},{"author_name":"Katherine Arn","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Kosik","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Diego Acosta-Alvear","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Z Wilson","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Lynn Fitzgibbons","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arias","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology, Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Margarida Correia-Neves","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

It is of importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and two other patients (4%) were only positive in one of the six serological assays employed. For the remainder, antibody response against the S-protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. Regarding neutralization, only six patients (12%) could be classified as highly neutralizers. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, employing a novel serological Western blot system to characterize antibody responses against seasonal coronaviruses, we found that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization. This highlights the difficulty to define reliable surrogate markers for immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia Ruetalo","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Ramona Businger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Karina Althaus","author_inst":"Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Simon Fink","author_inst":"NMI, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Felix Ruoff","author_inst":"NMI, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Klaus Hamprecht","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Bertram Flehmig","author_inst":"Mediagnost GmbH, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Tamam Bakchoul","author_inst":"Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Markus F Templin","author_inst":"NMI, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Schindler","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Holly Smith","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Ali Javanbakht","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Betsy Malear","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Laura Polito","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Stewart Comer","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital; Pacific Diagnostic Laboratories, Santa Barbara,"},{"author_name":"Katherine Arn","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Kosik","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Diego Acosta-Alvear","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Z Wilson","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Lynn Fitzgibbons","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arias","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology, Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Margarida Correia-Neves","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

In this paper, we have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance in comparison with four commercial ELISAs, EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP COVID-19 IgM\/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were compared using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%\/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%\/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%\/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%\/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%\/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%\/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%\/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%\/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%\/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of positive signals from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, positivity varied with assay repetition. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with analyte prior to performing the assay). In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by analyte spiking. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of false positivity in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the analyte, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system. Identification of these targets will be essential to improving assay performance.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Rikhtegaran Tehrani","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Saman Saadat","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ebtehal Saleh","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Niel Constantine","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Anthony L.

We aimed to investigate this in a large-scale population-based study in England. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared to people without HIV. COVID-19 death was defined by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death, initially adjusted for age and sex, then adding adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and finally for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and calendar time. Results: 17.3 million adults were included, of whom 27,480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. There were 14,882 COVID-19 deaths during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had nearly three-fold higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex (HR=2.90, 95% CI 1.96-4.30). The association was attenuated but risk remained substantially raised, after adjustment for deprivation and ethnicity (adjusted HR=2.52, 1.70-3.73) and further adjustment for comorbidities (HR=2.30, 1.55-3.41). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of black ethnicity (HR = 3.80, 2.15-6.74, compared to 1.64, 0.92-2.90 in non-black individuals, p-interaction=0.045) Interpretation: HIV infection was associated with a markedly raised risk of COVID-19 death in a country with high levels of antiretroviral therapy coverage and viral suppression; the association was larger in people of black ethnicity.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brian MacKenna","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna Schultz","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Morton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Harriet J Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;
