Due to lack of specific medicine and vaccine, viral infection has gained a frightening rate and created a devastating state across the globe. Here the authors have attempted to design epitope based potential peptide as a vaccine candidate using immunoinformatics approach. As of evidence from literatures, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a key protein to initiate the viral infection within a host cell thus used here as a reasonable vaccine target. We have predicted a 9-mer peptide as representative of both B-cell and T-cell epitopic region along with suitable properties such as antigenic and non-allergenic. To its support, strong molecular interaction of the predicted peptide was also observed with MHC molecules and Toll Like receptors. The present study may helpful to step forward in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohit Pritam Das","author_inst":"Centre for Biotechnology, Siksha O Anusandhan (Deemed to be University), Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"},{"author_name":"Manaswini Jagadeb","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"},{"author_name":"Surya Narayan Rath","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.180034","rel_title":"Fourier spectral density of the coronavirus genome","rel_date":"2020-07-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.180034","rel_abs":"We present an analysis of the coronavirus RNA genome via a study of its Fourier spectral density based on a binary representation of the nucleotide sequence. We find that at low frequencies, the power spectrum presents a small and distinct departure from the behavior expected from an uncorrelated sequence. We provide a couple of simple models to characterize such deviations. Away from a small low-frequency domain, the spectrum presents largely stochastic fluctuations about fixed values which vary inversely with the genome size generally. It exhibits no other peaks apart from those associated with triplet codon usage. We uncover an interesting, new scaling law for the coronavirus genome: the complexity of the genome scales linearly with the power-law exponent that characterizes the enveloping curve of the low-frequency domain of the spectral density.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hai Siong Tan","author_inst":"National Center for Theoretical Sciences, Physics Division, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Manaswini Jagadeb","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"},{"author_name":"Surya Narayan Rath","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.181123","rel_title":"Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from North Africa: viral origins and mutational spectrum","rel_date":"2020-07-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.181123","rel_abs":"In Morocco two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been recorded. The first one occurred from March 02, 2020 with infections mostly imported from Europe and the second one dominated by local infections.\n\nAt the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources.\n\nOur finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1\/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries. These results have the potential to lead to new comprehensive investigations combining genomic data, epidemiological information and the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meriem Laamarti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Souad Kartti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Tarek Alouane","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rokia Laamarti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Center, Moroccan Foundation for Science, Innovation & Research (MAScIR), Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Loubna Allam","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Mouna Ouadghiri","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"M.W.

Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid  in silico assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response. Our results accelerate the evaluation and prioritization of new drug development programmes and repurposing of trials to prevent, treat or reduce adverse outcomes. Rapid sharing and dynamic and detailed interrogation of results is facilitated through an interactive webserver (https:\/\/omicscience.org\/apps\/covidpgwas\/).","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maik Pietzner","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Wheeler","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Julia Carrasco-Zanini","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Johannes Raffler","author_inst":"Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH)"},{"author_name":"Nicola D.

One injection of tocilizumab led to rapid improvements in clinical features, inflammatory findings, and oxygen supply in seven patients with severe COVID-19 and substantial amelioration in two patients who were critically ill, whereas four patients, who exhibited rapidly worsened respiratory function, required artificial ventilatory support even after tocilizumab treatment.

The S1-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was genetically fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc moiety, which contributes to mediate S1-Fc cellular internalization by Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells. Immediately upon administration intramuscularly, our novel vaccine candidate recombinant rS1-Fc homes to lymph nodes in vivo where Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells reside. Seroconversion is achieved as early as day 7, mounting considerably increased levels of anti-S1 IgGs in vivo. Interestingly, immunization at elevated doses with non-expiring S1-Fc encoding dsDNA favors the education of a desired antigen-specific adaptive T cell response. However, low-dose immunization, safeguarding patient safety, using recombinant rS1-Fc, elicits a considerably elevated protection amplitude against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our promising findings on rS1-Fc protein immunization prompted us to further develop an affordable and safe product for delivery to our communities in need for COVID-19 vaccinations.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andreas Herrmann","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Junki Maruyama","author_inst":"Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Chanyu Yue","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Christoph Lahtz","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Heyue Zhou","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Lisa Kerwin","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Whenzong Guo","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yanliang Zhang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Wlliam Soo Hoo","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Soonpin Yei","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Sunkuk Kwon","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Fu","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Sachi Johnson","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Arthur Ledesma","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yiran Zhuang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yingcong Zhuang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Elena Yei","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Adamus","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Slobodan Praessler","author_inst":"Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Henry Ji","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Toshio Tanaka","author_inst":"Osaka Habikino Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Rachid Mentag","author_inst":"Biotechnology Unit, Regional Center of Agricultural Research of Rabat, National Institute of Agricultural Research, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.175778","rel_title":"Single-cell transcriptional atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) provides insight into the cellular mechanisms which enable bats to be viral reservoirs","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.175778","rel_abs":"Bats are a major \"viral reservoir\" in nature and there is a great interest in not only the cell biology of their innate and adaptive immune systems, but also in the expression patterns of receptors used for cellular entry by viruses with potential cross-species transmission.

This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon {beta} and tumor necrosis factor- compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis.

ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc. These data narrow the potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of ACE2-Fc.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huihui Mou","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Brian Quinlan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Haiyong Peng","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Insititute"},{"author_name":"Yan Guo","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shoujiao Peng","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lizhou Zhang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Insitute"},{"author_name":"Meredith Davis-Gardner","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Gardner","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zhi Xiang Voo","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles C Bailey","author_inst":"Emmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Michael Alpert","author_inst":"Emmune, Inc."},{"author_name":"Christoph Rader","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hyeryun Choe","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jingchuan Zhong","author_inst":"National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of M"},{"author_name":"Hongping Wu","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mingkun Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation"},{"author_name":"Stephen R.

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr\/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies\/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time, and highest TAT.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amorce Lima","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vicki Healer","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Vendrone","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suzane Silbert","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stuart Weston","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Holly Hammond","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Lague","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alyse D Portnoff","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"James Norton","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mimi Guebre-Xabier","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Bin Zhou","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kelsey Jacobson","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Sonai Maciejewski","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Rafia Khatoon","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Malgorzata Wisniewska","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Will Mottitt","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stenfanie Kluepfel-Stahl","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Betty Ekechukwu","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"James Papin","author_inst":"University of Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, Department of Pathology, Division of Comparative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

In the lack of specific drugs or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, demands rapid diagnosis and management are crucial for controlling the outbreak in the community. Here we report the development of the first rapid-colorimetric assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the human nasopharyngeal RNA sample in less than 30 minutes. We utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range. Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19. The colloid retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects or human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women. The results were validated using nasopharangeal RNA samples from suspected COVID-19 subjects (n=136). Using RT-PCR as gold standard, the assay was found to have 85.29% sensitivity and 94.12% specificity. The optimized method has detection limit as little as 0.5 ng of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, the developed assay rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples in a cost-effective manner and would be useful in pandemic management by facilitating mass screening.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vinod Kumar","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Mishra","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Rajni Sharma","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Jyotsna Agarwal","author_inst":"Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Ujjala Ghoshal","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Tripti Khanna","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, Ramalingaswami Bhawan, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Lokendra K Sharma","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Santosh K Verma","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Swasti Tiwari","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Prabhakar Mishra","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Sanjay Gandhi PGIMS, Raibareli Road,  Lucknow -226014, India"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhou","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kelsey Jacobson","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Sonai Maciejewski","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Rafia Khatoon","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Malgorzata Wisniewska","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Will Mottitt","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stenfanie Kluepfel-Stahl","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Betty Ekechukwu","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"James Papin","author_inst":"University of Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, Department of Pathology, Division of Comparative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-\u00c5 and 3.8-\u00c5-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cong Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Yanxing Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Caixuan Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Chao Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenyu Han","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Yifan Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Qin Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Shutian Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Qiaoyu Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Yalei Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yong Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kaijian Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Liangliang Kong","author_inst":"The National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai (NFPS)"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Wang","author_inst":"The National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai (NFPS)"},{"author_name":"Qinyu Zuo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Zhong Huang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yao Cong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed an antiviral dose-response to remdesivir and demonstrated the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a physiologically relevant platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessie Huang","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Adam J Hume","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Kristine M Abo","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Rhiannon B Werder","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Carlos Villacorta-Martin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos D Alysandratos","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Mary Lou Beermann","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Judith Olejnik","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Ellen Suder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Esther Bullitt","author_inst":"Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Anne Hinds","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arjun Sharma","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine; Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, University Medical Center Mainz"},{"author_name":"Markus Bosmann","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine, and Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center; Ce"},{"author_name":"Finn Hawkins","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Eric J Burks","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohsan Saeed","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Andrew A Wilson","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Elke M\u00fchlberger","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Darrell N Kotton","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus. Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on predicted RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are uncharacterized. Here we report the secondary structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq). Our results reveal previously undescribed structures within critical regulatory elements such as the genomic transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Contrary to previous studies, our in-cell data show that the structure of the frameshift element, which is a major drug target, is drastically different from prevailing in vitro models. The genomic structure detailed here lays the groundwork for coronavirus RNA biology and will guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tammy C.T.

Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Malimova","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Abhigyan Satyam","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Michelle Melanson","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Brian T.

PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits.

Because modulating \u22121 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates \u22121 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect \u22121 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the \u22121 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of \u22121 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress \u22121 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal \u22121 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of \u22121 PRF.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna Neupane","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Sneha Munshi","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Meng Zhao","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Dustin B Ritchie","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Sandaru M Ileperuma","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Michael T Woodside","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Diego Acosta-Alvear","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Ayshwarya Subramanian","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Grinkevich","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Estefania Reyes Bricio","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Abbe Clark","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Thompson","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jamie Marshall","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Juan Lorenzo Pablo","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Julie Roignot","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maheswarareddy Emani","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Racette","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Valeria Padovano","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephen P.

Methods This population survey study presents cohort characteristics and baseline observations linked to the acute-mid phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of perceived threats and concerns, occupational and financial impacts, social impacts and stress as measured by the Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) collected cross-sectionally between April 3 and May 15, 2020. A multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with stress changes relative to pre-outbreak estimates. Results 6,040\/6,685 (90.4%) participants filled out at least 1\/3 of the survey and were included in the analyses. On average, PSS scores increased from 12.9+6.8 before the outbreak to 14.9+8.3 during the outbreak (p<0.001). The independent factors associated with stress worsening were: having a mental disorder, female sex, having underage children, heavier alcohol consumption, working with the general public, shorter sleep duration, younger age, less time elapsed since the start of the outbreak, lower stress before the outbreak, worse symptoms that could be linked to COVID-19, lower coping skills, worse obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to germs and contamination, personalities loading on extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism, left-wing political views, worse family relationships, and spending less time exercising and doing artistic activities. Interpretation Cross-sectional analyses showed a significant increase from average low to moderate stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Identified modifiable factors associated with an increase in stress may be informative for intervention development.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Robillard","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Mysa Saad","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Jodi D.

Methods: Lung ultrasound was performed to 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a University Hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated using a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division (lung score -LS-). Ultrasound findings, along with clinical characteristics, were recorded. Results: All patients showed ultrasound involvement in at least 1 area (mean 8 {+\/-} 3.5). Total LS was 15.3 {+\/-} 8.1, without differences between left and right lung. Most affected regions were the lower one (95.2%) and the posterior one (73.8%). Total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with PaO2\/FiO2; by lung regions, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior one (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper one (r = -0.731). 22.2% of patients required non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS). Multivariate analysis shows that anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, is significant (odds ratio 2.159, 95% confidence interval 1.309 to 3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. Anterior region LS [&ge;] 4 and total LS [&ge;] 19 have similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS. Conclusions: Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower ones. The anterior region has prognostic value, because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS [&ge;] 4 has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Castelao","author_inst":"University Hospital of Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Desir\u00e9e Graziani","author_inst":"University Hospital of Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"- Collaborative Working Group COVID Pulmonology Guadalajara","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis Izquierdo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Alexander Daros","author_inst":"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Samuel Paul Louis Veissiere","author_inst":"Culture, Mind and Brain research group, Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Lena Quilty","author_inst":"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Karianne Dion","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Ashley Nixon","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Phillips","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhatla","author_inst":"The Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Edward Spilg","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Roger Godbout","author_inst":"Hopital en sante mentale Rivieres-des-Prairies, CIUSSS du Nord-de-l'ile-de-Montreal"},{"author_name":"Bashour Yazji","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Cynda Hylton Rushton","author_inst":"Berman Institute of Bioethics, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Wendy Gifford","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Sciences School of Nursing, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Mamta Gautam","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Addo Boafo","author_inst":"The Children s Hospital of Eastern Ontario"},{"author_name":"Tetyana Kendzerska","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Lucienne Ronco","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Wagner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"George C.

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, especially short and medium chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be incapable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and, as such, may have a compromised capacity to transport and deliver oxygen.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiffany Thomas","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Davide Stefanoni","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Monika Dzieciatkowska","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Aaron Issaian","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Travis Nemkov","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Ryan C Hill","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard O Francis","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Krystalyn E Hudson","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Paul W Buehler","author_inst":"University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"James C Zimring","author_inst":"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kirk C Hansen","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven L Spitalnik","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Angelo D'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Bashour Yazji","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Cynda Hylton Rushton","author_inst":"Berman Institute of Bioethics, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Wendy Gifford","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Sciences School of Nursing, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Mamta Gautam","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Addo Boafo","author_inst":"The Children s Hospital of Eastern Ontario"},{"author_name":"Tetyana Kendzerska","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Lucienne Ronco","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Wagner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"George C.

Design: Cross-sectional household surveys of a representative sample of the population in England from April-May 2020. Participants: The sample included 3,285 adults aged [&ge;]18 years. Measurements: Participants who reported they definitely or think they had coronavirus were classified as having a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before eating, before preparing foods or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had i) attempted to quit smoking, ii) attempted to quit vaping, and iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. Findings: Odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly greater among current smokers (20.9%, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.73) and long-term (>1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, ORadj=1.33, 95%CI=1.05-1.68) than never smokers (14.5%).

Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand washing before face touching, engagement in hand washing behaviours was high (>85%) regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of past-year smokers who made a quit attempt in the past three months were triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one-in-ten current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19. Most people reported smoking the same amount inside the home. Conclusions: In a representative sample of the adult population in England, current smokers and long-term ex-smokers had higher odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection than never smokers, but there were no large differences by NRT or e-cigarette use.

We tested if prior infections with seasonal coronaviruses impacted SARS-CoV-2 infections and related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS). Methods: This cross-sectional observational study in Paris hospitals enrolled 739 pauci or asymptomatic children (HOS group) plus 36 children with suspected MIS (MIS group). Prevalence, antigen specificity and neutralizing capability of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested. Antibody frequency and titres against Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) of the four seasonal coronaviruses (NL63, HKU1, 229E, OC43) were measured in a subset of seropositive patients (54 SARS-CoV-2 (HOS-P subgroup) and 15 MIS (MIS-P subgroup)), and in 118 matched SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients (CTL subgroup). Findings: SARS-CoV-2 mean prevalence rate in HOSP children was 11.7% from April 1 to June 1. Neutralizing antibodies were found in 55.6% of seropositive children, and their relative frequency increased with time (up to 100 % by mid-May). A majority of MIS children (25\/36) were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, of which all tested (n=15) had neutralizing antibodies. On average, seropositive MIS children had higher N and S1 SARS-CoV-2 titres as compared to HOS children. Patients from HOS-P, MIS-P, and CTL subgroups had a similar prevalence of antibodies against the four seasonal HCoVs (66.9 -100%). The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was not significantly different in children who had prior seasonal coronavirus infection. Interpretation: Prior infection with HCoVs does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and related MIS in children. Children develop neutralizing antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"isabelle sermet","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"sarah temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"christele huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"sylvie behillil","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"vincent gadjos","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"thomas bigot","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"thibaut lurier","author_inst":"vetagrosup"},{"author_name":"delphine chretien","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marija backovick","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Agnes Moisan-Delaunay","author_inst":"cea"},{"author_name":"flora donati","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"melanie albert","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"elsa foucaud","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Bettina Mesplees","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"gregoire benoist","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"albert fayes","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc duval-arnould","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"celia cretolle","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marina charbit","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"melodie aubart","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Johanne Auriau","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"matthie lorrot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Dulanjalee Kariyawasam","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"laura fertita","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Gilles Orliaguet","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142513","rel_title":"Epidemic Trend Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in SAARC Countries Using Modified SIR (M-SIR) Predictive Model","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142513","rel_abs":"A novel coronavirus causing the severe and fatal respiratory syndrome was identified in China, is now producing outbreaks in more than two hundred countries around the world, and became pandemic by the time. In this article, a modified version of the well known mathematical epidemic model Susceptible (S)- Infected (I)- Recovered (R) is used to analyze the epidemic's course of COVID-19 in eight different countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). To achieve this goal, the parameters of the SIR model are identified by using publicly available data for the corresponding countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Based on the prediction model we estimated the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak in SAARC countries for 20 days, 90 days, and 180 days respectively. An SML (short-mid-long) term prediction model has been designed to understand the early dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the south-east Asian region. The maximum and minimum basic reproduction number (R0 = 1.33 and 1.07) for SAARC countries are predicted to be in Pakistan and Bhutan. We equate simulation results with real data in the SAARC countries on the COVID-19 outbreak, and model potential countermeasure implementation scenarios. Our results should provide policymakers with a method for evaluating the impacts of possible interventions, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracking.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samrat Kumar Dey","author_inst":"Dhaka International University (DIU)"},{"author_name":"Md.

We report findings from the epidemiological investigation of the initial 135 COVID-19 cases in Brunei and describe the impact of control measures and travel restrictions. Methods Epidemiological and clinical information were obtained for all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brunei, whose symptom onset was from March 9 to April 5, 2020 (covering the initial 5 weeks of the epidemic). Transmission-related measures such as reproduction number (R), incubation period, serial interval were estimated. Time-varying R was calculated to assess the effectiveness of control measures. Results A total of 135 cases were detected, of which 53 (39.3%) were imported. The median age was 36 years (range = 0.5 to 72). 41 (30.4%) and 13 (9.6%) were presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases respectively. The median incubation period was 5 days (IQR = 5, range = 1 to 11), and the mean serial interval was 5.39 days (sd = 4.47; 95% CI: 4.25, 6.53). R0 was between 3.88 and 5.96, and the doubling time was 1.3 days. By the 13th day of the epidemic, the Rt was under one (Rt = 0.91; 95% credible interval: 0.62, 1.32 ) and the epidemic was under control. Conclusion Epidemic control was achieved through a combination of public health measures, with emphasis on a test-isolate-trace approach supplemented by travel restrictions and moderate physical distancing measures but no actual lockdown. To maintain suppression, regular and ongoing testing of high-risk groups can supplement the existing surveillance program.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Liling Chaw","author_inst":"Universiti Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Sirajul Adli Jamaludin","author_inst":"Environmental Health Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Wan Wen Patricia Poh","author_inst":"Department of Dental Services, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei"},{"author_name":"delphine chretien","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marija backovick","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Agnes Moisan-Delaunay","author_inst":"cea"},{"author_name":"flora donati","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"melanie albert","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"elsa foucaud","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Bettina Mesplees","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"gregoire benoist","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"albert fayes","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc duval-arnould","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"celia cretolle","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marina charbit","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"melodie aubart","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Johanne Auriau","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"matthie lorrot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Dulanjalee Kariyawasam","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"laura fertita","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Gilles Orliaguet","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
