Because modulating \u22121 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates \u22121 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect \u22121 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the \u22121 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of \u22121 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress \u22121 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal \u22121 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of \u22121 PRF.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna Neupane","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Sneha Munshi","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Meng Zhao","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Dustin B Ritchie","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Sandaru M Ileperuma","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Michael T Woodside","author_inst":"University of Alberta"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142638","rel_title":"Social, Financial and Psychological Stress during an Emerging Pandemic: Observations from a Population Web-Based Survey in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142638","rel_abs":"Background Understanding the multifaceted impacts of the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) outbreak as it unfolds is crucial to identify the most critical needs and to inform targeted interventions. Methods This population survey study presents cohort characteristics and baseline observations linked to the acute-mid phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of perceived threats and concerns, occupational and financial impacts, social impacts and stress as measured by the Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) collected cross-sectionally between April 3 and May 15, 2020. A multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with stress changes relative to pre-outbreak estimates. Results 6,040\/6,685 (90.4%) participants filled out at least 1\/3 of the survey and were included in the analyses. On average, PSS scores increased from 12.9+6.8 before the outbreak to 14.9+8.3 during the outbreak (p<0.001). The independent factors associated with stress worsening were: having a mental disorder, female sex, having underage children, heavier alcohol consumption, working with the general public, shorter sleep duration, younger age, less time elapsed since the start of the outbreak, lower stress before the outbreak, worse symptoms that could be linked to COVID-19, lower coping skills, worse obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to germs and contamination, personalities loading on extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism, left-wing political views, worse family relationships, and spending less time exercising and doing artistic activities. Interpretation Cross-sectional analyses showed a significant increase from average low to moderate stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Identified modifiable factors associated with an increase in stress may be informative for intervention development.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Robillard","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Mysa Saad","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Jodi D.

Methods: Lung ultrasound was performed to 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a University Hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated using a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division (lung score -LS-). Ultrasound findings, along with clinical characteristics, were recorded. Results: All patients showed ultrasound involvement in at least 1 area (mean 8 {+\/-} 3.5). Total LS was 15.3 {+\/-} 8.1, without differences between left and right lung. Most affected regions were the lower one (95.2%) and the posterior one (73.8%). Total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with PaO2\/FiO2; by lung regions, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior one (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper one (r = -0.731). 22.2% of patients required non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS). Multivariate analysis shows that anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, is significant (odds ratio 2.159, 95% confidence interval 1.309 to 3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. Anterior region LS [&ge;] 4 and total LS [&ge;] 19 have similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS. Conclusions: Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower ones. The anterior region has prognostic value, because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS [&ge;] 4 has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Castelao","author_inst":"University Hospital of Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Desir\u00e9e Graziani","author_inst":"University Hospital of Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"- Collaborative Working Group COVID Pulmonology Guadalajara","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis Izquierdo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Guadalajara"},{"author_name":"Alexander Daros","author_inst":"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Samuel Paul Louis Veissiere","author_inst":"Culture, Mind and Brain research group, Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Lena Quilty","author_inst":"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Karianne Dion","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Ashley Nixon","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Phillips","author_inst":"The Royal Institute of Mental Health Research"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhatla","author_inst":"The Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Edward Spilg","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Roger Godbout","author_inst":"Hopital en sante mentale Rivieres-des-Prairies, CIUSSS du Nord-de-l'ile-de-Montreal"},{"author_name":"Bashour Yazji","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Cynda Hylton Rushton","author_inst":"Berman Institute of Bioethics, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Wendy Gifford","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Sciences School of Nursing, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Mamta Gautam","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Addo Boafo","author_inst":"The Children s Hospital of Eastern Ontario"},{"author_name":"Tetyana Kendzerska","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142489","rel_title":"Forecasting the Number of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases in Ethiopia Using Exponential Smoothing Times Series Model","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142489","rel_abs":"The main objective of this study is to forecast COVID-19 case in Ethiopiausing the best-fitted model.

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, especially short and medium chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be incapable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and, as such, may have a compromised capacity to transport and deliver oxygen.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiffany Thomas","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Davide Stefanoni","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Monika Dzieciatkowska","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Aaron Issaian","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Travis Nemkov","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Ryan C Hill","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard O Francis","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Krystalyn E Hudson","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Paul W Buehler","author_inst":"University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"James C Zimring","author_inst":"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kirk C Hansen","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven L Spitalnik","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Angelo D'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Bashour Yazji","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Cynda Hylton Rushton","author_inst":"Berman Institute of Bioethics, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Wendy Gifford","author_inst":"Faculty of Health Sciences School of Nursing, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Mamta Gautam","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Addo Boafo","author_inst":"The Children s Hospital of Eastern Ontario"},{"author_name":"Tetyana Kendzerska","author_inst":"The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \/ University of Ottawa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142661","rel_title":"COVID-19, smoking, vaping and quitting: A representative population survey in England","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142661","rel_abs":"Aims: To explore 1) associations between suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, hand washing, smoking status, e-cigarette use, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use and 2) whether COVID-19 has prompted smoking and vaping quit attempts, and more smoking inside the home. Design: Cross-sectional household surveys of a representative sample of the population in England from April-May 2020. Participants: The sample included 3,285 adults aged [&ge;]18 years. Measurements: Participants who reported they definitely or think they had coronavirus were classified as having a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before eating, before preparing foods or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had i) attempted to quit smoking, ii) attempted to quit vaping, and iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. Findings: Odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly greater among current smokers (20.9%, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.73) and long-term (>1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, ORadj=1.33, 95%CI=1.05-1.68) than never smokers (14.5%). Recent (<1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of suspected infection (22.2%, ORadj=1.50, 95%CI=0.85-2.53, Bayes factor=0.55-1.17). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand washing before face touching, engagement in hand washing behaviours was high (>85%) regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of past-year smokers who made a quit attempt in the past three months were triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one-in-ten current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19. Most people reported smoking the same amount inside the home. Conclusions: In a representative sample of the adult population in England, current smokers and long-term ex-smokers had higher odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection than never smokers, but there were no large differences by NRT or e-cigarette use. In general, engagement in hand washing was high regardless of nicotine or tobacco use.

We tested if prior infections with seasonal coronaviruses impacted SARS-CoV-2 infections and related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS). Methods: This cross-sectional observational study in Paris hospitals enrolled 739 pauci or asymptomatic children (HOS group) plus 36 children with suspected MIS (MIS group). Prevalence, antigen specificity and neutralizing capability of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested. Antibody frequency and titres against Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) of the four seasonal coronaviruses (NL63, HKU1, 229E, OC43) were measured in a subset of seropositive patients (54 SARS-CoV-2 (HOS-P subgroup) and 15 MIS (MIS-P subgroup)), and in 118 matched SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients (CTL subgroup). Findings: SARS-CoV-2 mean prevalence rate in HOSP children was 11.7% from April 1 to June 1. Neutralizing antibodies were found in 55.6% of seropositive children, and their relative frequency increased with time (up to 100 % by mid-May). A majority of MIS children (25\/36) were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, of which all tested (n=15) had neutralizing antibodies. On average, seropositive MIS children had higher N and S1 SARS-CoV-2 titres as compared to HOS children. Patients from HOS-P, MIS-P, and CTL subgroups had a similar prevalence of antibodies against the four seasonal HCoVs (66.9 -100%). The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was not significantly different in children who had prior seasonal coronavirus infection. Interpretation: Prior infection with HCoVs does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and related MIS in children. Children develop neutralizing antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"isabelle sermet","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"sarah temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"christele huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"sylvie behillil","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"vincent gadjos","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"thomas bigot","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"thibaut lurier","author_inst":"vetagrosup"},{"author_name":"delphine chretien","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marija backovick","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Agnes Moisan-Delaunay","author_inst":"cea"},{"author_name":"flora donati","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"melanie albert","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"elsa foucaud","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Bettina Mesplees","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"gregoire benoist","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"albert fayes","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc duval-arnould","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"celia cretolle","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marina charbit","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"melodie aubart","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Johanne Auriau","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"matthie lorrot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Dulanjalee Kariyawasam","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"laura fertita","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Gilles Orliaguet","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142513","rel_title":"Epidemic Trend Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in SAARC Countries Using Modified SIR (M-SIR) Predictive Model","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142513","rel_abs":"A novel coronavirus causing the severe and fatal respiratory syndrome was identified in China, is now producing outbreaks in more than two hundred countries around the world, and became pandemic by the time. In this article, a modified version of the well known mathematical epidemic model Susceptible (S)- Infected (I)- Recovered (R) is used to analyze the epidemic's course of COVID-19 in eight different countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). To achieve this goal, the parameters of the SIR model are identified by using publicly available data for the corresponding countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Based on the prediction model we estimated the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak in SAARC countries for 20 days, 90 days, and 180 days respectively. An SML (short-mid-long) term prediction model has been designed to understand the early dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the south-east Asian region. The maximum and minimum basic reproduction number (R0 = 1.33 and 1.07) for SAARC countries are predicted to be in Pakistan and Bhutan.

We report findings from the epidemiological investigation of the initial 135 COVID-19 cases in Brunei and describe the impact of control measures and travel restrictions. Methods Epidemiological and clinical information were obtained for all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brunei, whose symptom onset was from March 9 to April 5, 2020 (covering the initial 5 weeks of the epidemic). Transmission-related measures such as reproduction number (R), incubation period, serial interval were estimated. Time-varying R was calculated to assess the effectiveness of control measures. Results A total of 135 cases were detected, of which 53 (39.3%) were imported. The median age was 36 years (range = 0.5 to 72). 41 (30.4%) and 13 (9.6%) were presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases respectively. The median incubation period was 5 days (IQR = 5, range = 1 to 11), and the mean serial interval was 5.39 days (sd = 4.47; 95% CI: 4.25, 6.53). R0 was between 3.88 and 5.96, and the doubling time was 1.3 days. By the 13th day of the epidemic, the Rt was under one (Rt = 0.91; 95% credible interval: 0.62, 1.32 ) and the epidemic was under control. Conclusion Epidemic control was achieved through a combination of public health measures, with emphasis on a test-isolate-trace approach supplemented by travel restrictions and moderate physical distancing measures but no actual lockdown. To maintain suppression, regular and ongoing testing of high-risk groups can supplement the existing surveillance program.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Liling Chaw","author_inst":"Universiti Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Sirajul Adli Jamaludin","author_inst":"Environmental Health Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Wan Wen Patricia Poh","author_inst":"Department of Dental Services, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei"},{"author_name":"delphine chretien","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marija backovick","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Agnes Moisan-Delaunay","author_inst":"cea"},{"author_name":"flora donati","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"melanie albert","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"elsa foucaud","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Bettina Mesplees","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"gregoire benoist","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"albert fayes","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc duval-arnould","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"celia cretolle","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marina charbit","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"melodie aubart","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Johanne Auriau","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"matthie lorrot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Dulanjalee Kariyawasam","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"laura fertita","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Gilles Orliaguet","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142448","rel_title":"Using past and current data to estimate potential crisis service use in mental healthcare after the COVID-19 lockdown: South London and Maudsley data","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142448","rel_abs":"The lockdown policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare with uncertain consequences over the 12 months ahead.

Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London), we carried out a range of descriptive analyses to inform the Trust on patient groups who might be most likely to require inpatient and home treatment team (HTT) crisis care. We considered the 12 months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th March, drawing on comparable findings from previous years, and quantified levels of change in service delivery to those most likely to receive crisis care. For 12-month crisis days from 16th March in 2015-19, we found that most (over 80%) were accounted for by inpatient care (rather than HTT), most (around 75%) were used by patients who were current or recent Trust patients at the commencement of follow-up, and highest numbers were used by patients with a previously recorded schizophreniform disorder diagnosis. For current\/recent patients on 16th March there had been substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the following 31 days in 2020, more than previous years; changes in total non-inpatient contact numbers did not differ in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had been a marked switch from face-to-face to virtual contacts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Stewart","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Broadbent","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Sirajul Adli Jamaludin","author_inst":"Environmental Health Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Wan Wen Patricia Poh","author_inst":"Department of Dental Services, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei"},{"author_name":"delphine chretien","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marija backovick","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Agnes Moisan-Delaunay","author_inst":"cea"},{"author_name":"flora donati","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"melanie albert","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"elsa foucaud","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Bettina Mesplees","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"gregoire benoist","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"albert fayes","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc duval-arnould","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"celia cretolle","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marina charbit","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"melodie aubart","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Johanne Auriau","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"matthie lorrot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Dulanjalee Kariyawasam","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"laura fertita","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Gilles Orliaguet","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142554","rel_title":"Citywide Nucleic Acid Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Post-lockdown Wuhan, China: Results and Implications","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142554","rel_abs":"Background: After the outbreak of Coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), stringent lockdown measures were imposed in Wuhan between January 23, 2020 and April 8, 2020. To provide evidence on the post-lockdown risk of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, the city government conducted a citywide nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection between May 14 and June 1, 2020. Methods: All city residents aged [&ge;]6 years were potentially eligible to participate the screening programme. The rate of detection of asymptomatic infected cases was calculated, and their demographic and geographic distributions were investigated. ArcGIS 10.0 was used to draw a geographic distribution of asymptomatic infected persons. Results: The screening programme recruited a total of 9,899,828 persons (response rate, 92.9%). The screening found no newly confirmed patients with COVID-19, and identified 300 asymptomatic infected cases (detection rate 0.303\/10,000). In addition, 107 of 34,424 previously recovered patients with a history of COVID-19 diagnosis were tested positive (relapse rate, 0.31%). Virus culture of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for all 300 asymptomatic cases and all 107 recovered COVID-19 patients. A total of 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases were traced and all of them had a negative nucleic acid testing result. Conclusions: Prevalence of COVID-19 nucleic acid test positivity was very low in the Wuhan general population, in recovered cases and in contacts of asymptomatic cases, five to eight weeks after the end of lockdown. These findings help resolve concerns about the post-lockdown risk of COVID-19 epidemic, and promote the recovery of economy and normal social life in Wuhan.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiyi Cao","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Gan","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Max Bachmann","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Yuchai Huang","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tiantian Wang","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liqing Li","author_inst":"Department of Management Science and Engineering, School of Economics and Management, Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University"},{"author_name":"Kai Lu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Jiang","author_inst":"Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University; Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of"},{"author_name":"Yanhong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Xv","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xin Shen","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qingfeng Tian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuanzhu Lv","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Hainan Clinical Research Center for Acute and Critical Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fujian Song","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxv Yin","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zuxun Lu","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"celia cretolle","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marina charbit","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"melodie aubart","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Johanne Auriau","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"matthie lorrot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Dulanjalee Kariyawasam","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"laura fertita","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Gilles Orliaguet","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142349","rel_title":"A handheld point-of-care system for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in under 20 minutes","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142349","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency characterized by the high rate of transmission and ongoing increase of cases globally. Rapid point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics to detect the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, are urgently needed to identify and isolate patients, contain its spread and guide clinical management. In this work, we report the development of a rapid PoC diagnostic test (< 20 min) based on reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and semiconductor technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from extracted RNA samples. The developed LAMP assay was tested on a real-time benchtop instrument (RT-qLAMP) showing a lower limit of detection of 10 RNA copies per reaction. It was validated against 183 clinical samples including 127 positive samples (screened by the CDC RT-qPCR assay). Results showed 90.55% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared to RT-qPCR and average positive detection times of 15.45 {+\/-} 4.43 min. For validating the incorporation of the RT-LAMP assay onto our PoC platform (RT-eLAMP), a subset of samples was tested (n=40), showing average detection times of 12.89 {+\/-} 2.59 min for positive samples (n=34), demonstrating a comparable performance to a benchtop commercial instrument. Paired with a smartphone for results visualization and geo-localization, this portable diagnostic platform with secure cloud connectivity will enable real-time case identification and epidemiological surveillance.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesus Rodriguez-Manzano","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kenny Malpartida-Cardenas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Moser","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ivana Pennisi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cavuto","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Luca Miglietta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Moniri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Penn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Satta","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Frances Davies","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Frances Bolt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alison Holmes","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pantelis Georgiou","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxv Yin","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zuxun Lu","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"celia cretolle","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marina charbit","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"melodie aubart","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Johanne Auriau","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"matthie lorrot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Dulanjalee Kariyawasam","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"laura fertita","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Gilles Orliaguet","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142455","rel_title":"Multiple Myeloma and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Clinical Characteristics and Prognostic Factors of Inpatient Mortality","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142455","rel_abs":"There is limited information on the characteristics, pre-admission prognostic factors, and outcomes of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using search engines (PubMed, Google Scholar, Medrixv and BioRixv) with keywords SARS CoV 2, novel coronavirus, COVID 19, ocular manifestations, conjunctival congestion, Ocular detection, Polymerase chain reaction, and conjunctivitis. The measure of heterogeneity was evaluated with the I2 statistic. The pooled proportion of patients presenting with symptoms and ocular samples PCR positivity was estimated. Results: A total of 20 studies (14 studies and 6 case reports) were included in the systematic review and 14 studies were included in the metaanalysis. The pooled prevalence of conjunctivitis was 5.17% (95% CI: 2.90 to 8.04). Conjunctivitis was reported as an initial symptom of the disease in 0.858 % (95% CI: 0.31 to 1.67). Common associated features include itching, chemosis, epiphora. Seven patients (29 %) with conjunctivitis showed positive results in ocular samples, whereas 13 patients (54%) showed positive only in their nasopharyngeal samples (NPs) or sputum samples and 4 patients (16 %) were negative for both NPs and Sputum as well as ocular samples. The pooled prevalence of ocular PCR positivity was 2.90 % (95% CI: 1.77 to 4.46) vs. NPs 89.8% (95% CI: 78.80 to 79.0). Conclusion: The prevalence of conjunctivitis and ocular samples PCR positivity among COVID 19 patients was low indicating that the eye is a less affected organ. However, conjunctivitis may present as the first symptom of the disease making the patient seek medical care at the earliest.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumen Sadhu","author_inst":"The Sankara Nethralaya Academy"},{"author_name":"Sushmitha Arcot Dandapani","author_inst":"The Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Deepmala Mazumdar","author_inst":"Vision Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Srinivasan","author_inst":"Medical research Foundation , Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmay Biswas","author_inst":"Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Ana Lopez de la Guia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Diego Conde","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Isabel Krsnik","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elena Prieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rosalia Riaza Grau","author_inst":"Hospital Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Gironella","author_inst":"Hopital Universitario Vall d Hebron, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Blanchard","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nerea Caminos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Donostia, Donostia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez de Larrea","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Alicia Senin","author_inst":"Institut Catala d Oncologia i Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Fernando Escalante","author_inst":"Hospital de Leon, Leon, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Enrique de la Puerta","author_inst":"Hospital de Galdakao, Vizcaya, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Gimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Sofia, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Martinez-Barranco","author_inst":"Hospital de Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Mateos","author_inst":"Hospital de Cruces, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Felipe Casado","author_inst":"Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Joan Blade","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Lahuerta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Javier De La Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jesus San-Miguel","author_inst":"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"ophthalmology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20138628","rel_title":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 outbreak period in Beijing: An online cross-sectional survey","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20138628","rel_abs":"Abstract Purpose: This study investigated the KAP towards COVID-19 and their influencing factors among primary and middle school students during the self-quarantine period in Beijing. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among students from 18 primary and middle schools in Beijing during March 2020. Stratified cluster sampling was conducted. Demographic and KAP-related COVID-19 information was collected through an online questionnaire. The influencing factors were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 7,377 students were included. The overall correct rate for COVID-19 knowledge was 74.1%, while only 31.5% and 40.5% could identify the high-risk places of cross-infection and warning body temperature. Although 94.5% of respondents believed the epidemic could be controlled, over 50% expressed various concerns about the epidemic. The compliance rates for basic preventing behaviors were all over 80%, while those for \"rational and effective ventilation\" (39.2%) and \"dinning separately\" (38.6%) were low. The KAP levels were significantly differed according to various school categories of students. The COVID-19 knowledge (OR= 3.309, 95% CI: 2.921, 3.748) and attitude (OR=1.145, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.308) were associated with preventive practices. Besides, female, urban students, those with a healthy lifestyle, and those with the willingness to engage in healthcare tended to have better preventive practices. Conclusion: Most students in Beijing hold a high level of knowledge, optimistic attitudes and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. However, targeted interventions are still necessary, especially for students with high-risk characteristics.

Setting: Observational study with retrospective analysis in a French emergency department (ED). Participants and intervention: From March 3 to April 2, 2020, 385 adult patients presenting to the ED for suspected COVID-19 underwent an evaluation that included history, physical examination, blood tests, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chest CT. When the time-interval between chest CT and RT-PCR assays was longer than 7 days, patients were excluded from the study. Only patients with hospitalization criteria were included. Diagnosis accuracy was assessed using the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR. Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR, chest CT (also accompanied by lymphopenia) were measured and were also analyzed by subgroups of age and sex. Results: Among 377 included subjects, RT-PCR was positive in 36%, while chest CT was compatible with a COVID-19 diagnosis in 59%. In the population with positive RT-PCR, there were more men (55% vs 37%, p=0.015), a higher frequency of reticular and, or, interlobular septal thickening (53% vs 31%, p=0.02) as well as a higher frequency of bilateral lesion distribution (98% vs 86%, p=0.01) compared to the population with negative RT-PCR. The proportion of lymphopenia was higher in men vs women (47% vs 39%, p=0.03) and varies between patients >80 versus 50-80 and p<0.001). Using CT as reference, RT-PCR obtained a sensitivity of 61%, specificity of 93%. There was a significant difference between CT and RT-PCR diagnosis performance (p<0.001). When CT was accompanied by lymphopenia, sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were respectively 71% and 94%. CT abnormalities and lymphopenia provided diagnosis in 29% of patients with negative PCR. Conclusions: Chest CT had a superior yield than RT-PCR in COVID-19 hospitalized patients, especially when accompanied by lymphopenia.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marine Thieux","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Clinical Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Anne Charlotte Kalenderian","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Imapole"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Chabrol","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Imapole"},{"author_name":"Laurent Gendt","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Eurofins CBM 69"},{"author_name":"Emma Giraudier","author_inst":"Lyon 2 University Masters Degree in Medical Translation and Scientific Writing"},{"author_name":"Herve Lelievre","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Eurofins CBM 69"},{"author_name":"Samir Lounis","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Imapole"},{"author_name":"Yves Mataix","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emeline Moderni","author_inst":"Lyon 2 University Masters Degree in Medical Translation and Scientific Writing"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Paradisi","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Clinical Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Ranchon","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Carlos El Khoury","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Clinical Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Nerea Caminos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Donostia, Donostia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez de Larrea","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Alicia Senin","author_inst":"Institut Catala d Oncologia i Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Fernando Escalante","author_inst":"Hospital de Leon, Leon, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Enrique de la Puerta","author_inst":"Hospital de Galdakao, Vizcaya, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Gimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Sofia, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Martinez-Barranco","author_inst":"Hospital de Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Mateos","author_inst":"Hospital de Cruces, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Felipe Casado","author_inst":"Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Joan Blade","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Lahuerta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Javier De La Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jesus San-Miguel","author_inst":"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"},{"author_name":"benedicte pigneur","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Bader-Meunier","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"coralie briand","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"julie toubiana","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20141838","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 serological testing using electrochemiluminescence reveals arapid onset of seroconversion in severe COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20141838","rel_abs":"Despite ongoing efforts to characterize the host response toward SARS-CoV-2, a major gap in our knowledge still exists regarding the magnitude and duration of the humoral response.

Whereas IgM antibodies toward RBD were detected at early stages of the disease, IgM antibodies against NP did not develop. Analysis of the antibody response in mild versus moderate\/severe patients revealed a rapid onset of IgG and IgA antibodies, specifically in moderate\/severe patients. Finally, we observed a marked reduction in IgM\/IgA antibodies and to lesser extent, IgG, over time.

We describe our evaluation of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay on the Architect immunoassay analyser. Methods: We assessed the precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in samples from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive patients and healthy healthcare workers. The manufacturer cut-off index (COI) of 1.4 was adopted to identify positive results. We examined the assay cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies (influenza\/dengue\/hepatitis C\/hepatitis B) and rheumatoid factor (RF). The sample throughput of the Abbott assay was also assessed. Results: The Abbott assay showed excellent precision, with a CV of 3.4% for the negative control (COI = 0.06) and 1.6% for a high positive serum sample (COI = 8.6). Residual serum was available from 57 inpatients not initially suspected of having COVID-19, 29 of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The Abbott assay has a sensitivity of 90.9-100% when tested in 54 subjects [&ge;]14 days post PCR positive, and a specificity of 100% (N = 358). There was no cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies (influenza\/dengue\/hepatitis C\/hepatitis B) and RF. The Architect Abbott assay has a throughput of 100 samples in 70 minutes. Conclusion: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay shows excellent performance that is well within FDA and CDC guidelines when testing patients [&ge;]14 days POS with little cross-reactivity from other viral antibodies.

Helmet NIV has seen an increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is low-cost, readily available, and provides viral filters between the patient and clinician. Helmet NIV may also provide better patient outcomes by delaying or eliminating the need for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been limited, however, by the lack of a respiratory monitoring system that is needed to address known safety vulnerabilities and to provide clinicians with a respiratory profile of the patient. To address this safety need, we have developed an inexpensive respiratory monitoring system that is based on readily available commercial components and is suitable for rapid local manufacture. The system is designed for use in conjunction with the COVID-19 Helmet developed by Sea-Long Medical Systems, but is modular and can be used with other ventilation systems. The monitoring system comprises one or more flow and pressure sensors and a central remote station that can be used to remotely monitor up to 20 patients simultaneously. The system reports flow, pressure, and clinically relevant metrics including respiratory rate, tidal volume equivalent, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time (I:E). The device will sound alarms based on clinician-set thresholds. In bench tests using a commercial ventilator and artificial lung system, our device performs comparably to a commercial single-patient respiratory monitor. Results are presented from human-subject tests on a healthy volunteer undergoing helmet non-invasive ventilation. Detailed design and manufacturing documents are provided.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Princeton Open Ventilation Monitor Collaboration","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Philippe Bourrianne","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Stanley Chidzik","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Cohen","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Peter Elmer","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hallowell","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Todd J Kilbaugh","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"David Lange","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Leifer","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Daniel R.

An unprecedented 0.1 seconds of simulation of the viral proteome reveal how the spike complex uses conformational masking to evade an immune response, conformational changes implicated in the function of other viral proteins, and  cryptic pockets that are absent in experimental snapshots. These structures and mechanistic insights present new targets for the design of therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxwell I.

Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs together with saliva samples were obtained from 51 patients clinically diagnosed as potentially having COVID-19. Two different methods were compared: 1. RNA was extracted from 500 l of sample using a MagNA Pure Compact Instrument with an elution volume of 50l and 2. 700{micro}L of saliva were heat-inactivated at 96{degrees}C for 15 minutes, and directly subjected to RT-PCR. One step real time RT-PCR was performed using 5 l of extracted RNA or directly from 5 l of heated sample. RT-PCR was performed targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene region. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the results of the RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs as the gold standard. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 81.08%, 92.86%, 96.77% and 65.00%, respectively when RNA extraction was included in the protocol with saliva, whereas sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 83.78%, 92.86%, 68.42% and 96.88%, respectively, for the heat-inactivation protocol. However, when the analysis was performed exclusively on saliva samples with a limited time from the onset of symptoms (<9 days, N=28), these values were 90%, 87.5%, 44% and 98.75% for the heat-inactivation protocol. The study showed that RT-PCR can be performed using saliva in an RNA extraction free protocol, showing good sensitivity and specificity.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jordi Vila","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Hospital Clinic, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, CRESIB\/IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mariana Fernandez-Pittol","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos Hurtado","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Estela Moreno-Garc\u00eda","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rubio Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic i Provincial de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Mireia Navarro","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Marta Valiente","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Aida Peir\u00f3","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Nuria Seijas","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Alicia Cap\u00f3n","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Miguel Julian Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic i Provinicial de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Climent Casals-Pascual","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic i Provincial de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Carl A.

Many biomarkers have been suggested using large observational datasets but sample timing is crucial to ensure prognostic relevance. The DISCOVER study prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a UK hospital and analysed a panel of putative prognostic biomarkers on the admission blood sample to identify markers of poor outcome. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were recruited. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (IL-6, suPAR, KL-6, Troponin, Ferritin, LDH, BNP, Procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Age, NEWS score and CURB-65 were included as comparators. All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission, or death, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) figures calculated. Results: 155 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis. CRP (AUC 0.51 ,CI:0.40-0.62), lymphocyte count (AUC 0.62 ,CI:0.51-0.72), and other routine markers did not predict the primary outcome. IL-6 (AUC: 0.78,0.65-0.89) and suPAR (AUC 0.77 ,CI: 0.66-0.85) showed some promise, but simple clinical features alone such as NEWS score (AUC: 0.74 ,0.64-0.83) or age (AUC: 0.70 ,0.61-0.78) performed nearly as well. Discussion: Admission blood biomarkers have only moderate predictive value for predicting COVID-19 outcomes, while simple clinical features such as age and NEWS score outperform many biomarkers. IL-6 and suPAR had the best performance, and further studies should validate these biomarkers in a prospective fashion.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Marie Attwood","author_inst":"BCARE, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Karen Elvers","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Anna Morley","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jorgen McKernon","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian Oates","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Charmaine Donald","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alan Noel","author_inst":"BCARE, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alasdair MacGowan","author_inst":"BCARE, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fergus Hamilton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Carl A.

Methods: Between 28-30 April 2020, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among pupils, their parents and relatives, and staff of primary schools exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 in a city north of Paris, France. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered sociodemographic information and history of recent symptoms. A blood sample was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a flow-cytometry-based assay. Results: The infection attack rate (IAR) was 45\/510 (8.8%), 3\/42 (7.1%), 1\/28 (3.6%), 76\/641 (11.9%) and 14\/119 (11.8%) among primary school pupils, teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, and relatives, respectively (P = 0.29). Prior to school closure on February 14, three SARS-CoV-2 infected pupils attended three separate schools with no secondary cases in the following 14 days among pupils, teachers and non-teaching staff of the same schools. Familial clustering of cases was documented by the high proportion of antibodies among parents and relatives of infected pupils (36\/59 = 61.0% and 4\/9 = 44.4%, respectively). In children, disease manifestations were mild, and 24\/58 (41.4%) of infected children were asymptomatic.

All patients had more than 28 days follow up after discharge from the hospital. Results Moderate COVID-19 pneumonia group were 65 patients who received Enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 50 (76.9 %) and female patients were 15 (23.1 %). 34 (52.3 %) patients have comorbidity, 25 (38.5%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus and 2 (3.1 %) pregnant ladies. 19 (29.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 3L oxygen or less to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92%. All patients discharged home with no major or minor bleeding complications or significant complications. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia group were 63 patients who received methylprednisolone, enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 55 (87.3 %) and female patients were 8 (12.7 %). 37 (58.7 %) patients have comorbidity, and 24 (38.1%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus. 32 (50.8 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 4-9L oxygen, and 31 (49.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 10L oxygen or more, including 12 patients on a non-rebreathing mask. Patients received methylprednisolone were 37 (58.7 %) for 3 days, 16 (25.4 %) for 5 days and 10 (15.9 %) for more than 5 days. Sixty-two patients discharged home with one patient had a long stay, and the other two transferred to ICU. One long-stay patient transferred to ICU on low flow oxygen therapy. Conclusion Early use of a combined anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs treatment in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia prevent complications of the disease and improve clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khalid Mohammed Ghalilah","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Abdul Momin Sabir","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Irshad Ali Alvi","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Malak Alharbi","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Abdulrahman Basabrain","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mahmooud Aljundi","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ghazi Almohammadi","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zainab Almuairfi","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raed Alharbi","author_inst":"Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Zemsi","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Joelle Tambekou Sobngwi","author_inst":"RSD & London School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Thiery Ntandzi","author_inst":"Yaounde Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian Ngongang Ouankou","author_inst":"University of Dschang"},{"author_name":"Yves Wasnyo","author_inst":"Yaounde Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antoinette Ntsama Assiga","author_inst":"Yaounde Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jean Rene Nkeck","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Ahmadou Musa Jingi","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Magellan Guewo","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Eric Walter Pefura Yone","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Omgba Moussi","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul Owono Etoundi","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Jean Cyr Yombi","author_inst":"Universite Catholique de Louvain"},{"author_name":"Alain Patrick Menanga","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Samuel Kingue","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Ze Minkande","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Jean Claude Mbanya","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Pierre Cyrille Ongolo Zogo","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Pierre Joseph Fouda","author_inst":"Yaounde Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eugene Sobngwi","author_inst":"University of Yaounde 1"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Guilleminot","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"sylvie van der werf","author_inst":"institut pasteur"},{"author_name":"marianne leruez-ville","author_inst":"aphp"},{"author_name":"marc eloit","author_inst":"institut pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20135038","rel_title":"Differential occupational risks to healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2: A prospective observational study","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20135038","rel_abs":"Background Personal protective equipment (PPE) and social distancing are key measures designed to mitigate the risk of occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitals. Why healthcare workers nevertheless remain at increased risk is uncertain. Methods We conducted voluntary Covid-19 testing programmes for symptomatic and asymptomatic staff at a large UK teaching hospital using nasopharyngeal PCR testing and immunoassays for IgG antibodies. A positive result by either modality was used as a composite outcome. Risk factors for Covid-19 were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. Results 1083\/9809(11.0%) staff had evidence of Covid-19 at some time and provided data on potential risk-factors. Staff with a confirmed household contact were at greatest risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.63 [95%CI 3.30-6.50]). Higher rates of Covid-19 were seen in staff working in Covid-19-facing areas (21.2% vs. 8.2% elsewhere) (aOR 2.49 [2.00-3.12]). Controlling for Covid-19-facing status, risks were heterogenous across the hospital, with higher rates in acute medicine (1.50 [1.05-2.15]) and sporadic outbreaks in areas with few or no Covid-19 patients. Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) staff were relatively protected (0.46 [0.29-0.72]). Positive results were more likely in Black (1.61 [1.20-2.16]) and Asian (1.58 [1.34-1.86]) staff, independent of role or working location, and in porters and cleaners (1.93 [1.25-2.97]). Contact tracing around asymptomatic staff did not lead to enhanced case identification. 24% of staff\/patients remained PCR-positive at [&ge;]6 weeks post-diagnosis. Conclusions Increased Covid-19 risk was seen in acute medicine, among Black and Asian staff, and porters and cleaners. A bundle of PPE-related interventions protected staff in high-risk ICU areas.","rel_num_authors":50,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David W Eyre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sheila F Lumley","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mark Campbell","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Sims","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elaine Lawson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Fiona Warren","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Tim J James","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Stuart Cox","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alison Howarth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"George Doherty","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Stephanie B Hatch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James Kavanagh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Chau","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip W Fowler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Swann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Denis Volk","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dan Yang-Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole E Stoesser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Maria Dudareva","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Timothy Davies","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert H Shaw","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Leon Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise O Downs","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vogt","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Ali Amini","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bernadette C Young","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip Drennan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Donal Skelly","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Karpe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Neville","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Brent","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicola Jones","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lucas Martins Ferreira","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Christott","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian Marsden","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hoosdally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Richard Cornall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Derrick W Crook","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dave Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"- Oxford University Hospitals Staff Testing Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Timothy EA Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bruno Holthof","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ebner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher P Conlon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20121905","rel_title":"The therapeutic effectiveness of Convalescent plasma therapy on treating COVID-19 patients residing in respiratory care units in hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20121905","rel_abs":"Objectives: The current COVID-19 pandemic needs unconventional therapies to tackle the resulted high morbidity and mortality. Convalescent plasma is one of the therapeutic approaches that might be of benefit. Methods: Forty nine early-stage severe and critically-ill COVID-19 patients residing in RCU of three hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq were included, 21 received convalescent plasma while 28 did not receive, namely control group. Recovery or death, length of stay in hospital, and improvement in the clinical course of the disease were monitored clinically along with laboratory monitoring through SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via PCR, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM serological monitoring. Results: Patients received convalescent plasma showed reduced duration of infection in about 4 days, and showed less death rate, 1\/21 versus 8\/28 in control group. In, addition, all of the patients received convalescent plasma showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM 3 days after plasma transfusion. Plasma from donors with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and donors with positive SRAS-CoV-2 IgM showed better therapeutic results than other donors. Conclusions: Convalescent plasma therapy is an effective mode of therapy if donors with high level of SARS-Cov2 antibodies are selected and if recipients were at their early stage of critical illness, being no more than 3 days in RCU.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anwar M.
