We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, preprint databases, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 to June 1, 2020. From an initial 547 publications and 75 reports, 25 studies provided specific information on COVID-19 patients living with HIV. Studies described 252 patients, 80.9% were male, mean age was 52.7 years, and 98% were on ART. Co-morbidities in addition to HIV and COVID-19 (multimorbidity) included hypertension (39.3%), obesity or hyperlipidemia (19.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18.0%), and diabetes (17.2%). Two-thirds (66.5%) had mild to moderate symptoms, the most common being fever (74.0%) and cough (58.3%). Among patients who died, the majority (90.5%) were over 50 years old, male (85.7%), and had multimorbidity (64.3%). Our findings highlight the importance of identifying co-infections, addressing co-morbidities, and ensuring a secure supply of ART for PLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hossein Mirzaei","author_inst":"HIV\/STI Surveillance Research Center, and WHO Collaborating Center for HIV Surveillance, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical S"},{"author_name":"Willi McFarland","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Karamouzian","author_inst":"School of Population and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Hamid Sharifi","author_inst":"HIV\/STI Surveillance Research Center, and WHO Collaborating Center for HIV Surveillance, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical S"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hiv aids"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20147157","rel_title":"Effects of environmental factors on severity and mortality of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20147157","rel_abs":"Background Most respiratory viruses show pronounced seasonality, but for SARS-CoV-2 this still needs to be documented. Methods We examined the disease progression of COVID-19 in 6,911 patients admitted to hospitals in Europe and China. In addition, we evaluated progress of disease symptoms in 37,187 individuals reporting symptoms into the COVID Symptom Study application. Findings Meta-analysis of the mortality risk in eight European hospitals estimated odds ratios per one day increase in the admission date to be 0.981 (0.973-0.988, p<0.001) and per increase in ambient temperature of one degree Celsius to be 0.854 (0.773-0.944, p=0.007). Statistically significant decreases of comparable magnitude in median hospital stay, probability of transfer to Intensive Care Unit and need for mechanical ventilation were also observed in most, but not all hospitals. The analysis of individually reported symptoms of 37,187 individuals in the UK also showed the decrease in symptom duration and disease severity with time. Interpretation Severity of COVID-19 in Europe decreased significantly between March and May and the seasonality of COVID-19 is the most likely explanation. Mucosal barrier and mucociliary clearance can significantly decrease viral load and disease progression, and their inactivation by low relative humidity of indoor air might significantly contribute to severity of the disease.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Domagoj Kifer","author_inst":"University of Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Dario Bugada","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Judit Villar-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ivan Gudelj","author_inst":"Genos"},{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carole Helene Sudre","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Frano Vuckovic","author_inst":"Genos"},{"author_name":"Ivo Ugrina","author_inst":"Genos"},{"author_name":"Luca F Lorini","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bettinelli","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Ughi","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Maloberti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Oscar Epis","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Cristina Giannattasio","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Claudio Rossetti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Livije Kalogjera","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University Hospital \"Sestre milosrdnice\" Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Jasminka Persec","author_inst":"University Hospital Dubrava Zagreb, Croatia, University of Zagreb School of Dental Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luke Ollivere","author_inst":"Nottingham University Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ollivere","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huadong Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Digestive System Tumors of Zhejiang Province, Hwamei Hospital, University of Chi"},{"author_name":"Ting Cai","author_inst":"Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guruprasad Aithal","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Mikael Kajova","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Antti Sajantila","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Rafal Wojtowicz","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

Social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. Objective: To understand how underlying social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. Design: Retrospective analysis of the trajectory of reported SARS-CoV-2 case counts at the US county level during June 1, 2020 - June 30,2020 and social, demographic, and political characteristics of the county. Setting: United States. Participants: Reported SARS-CoV-2 cases. Exposures: Metropolitan designation, Social Deprivation Index (SDI), 2016 Republican Presidential Candidate Victory. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. Results: 1023\/3142 US counties were included in the analysis. 678 (66.3%) had increasing SARS-CoV-2 case counts between June 1 - June 30, 2020. In univariate analysis, counties with increasing case counts had a significantly higher SDI (median 48, IQR 24 - 72) than counties with non-increasing case counts (median 40, IQR 19 - 66; p=0.009). In the multivariable model, metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population, higher percentage of Black residents and a 10-point or greater Republican victory were independently associated with increasing case counts. Limitations: The data examines county-level voting patterns and does not account for individual voting behavior, subjecting this work to the potential for ecologic fallacy. Conclusion: Increasing case counts of SARS-CoV-2 in the US are likely driven by a combination of social disadvantage, social networks, and behavioral factors. Addressing social disadvantage and differential belief systems that may correspond with political alignment will be essential for pandemic control.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Mourad","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Turner","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Arthur W Baker","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Nwora Lance Okeke","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Shanti Narayanasamy","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert Rolfe Jr.","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"John J Engemann","author_inst":"Raleigh Infectious Diseases Associates"},{"author_name":"Gary M Cox","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Jason E Stout","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bettinelli","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Ughi","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Maloberti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Oscar Epis","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Cristina Giannattasio","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Claudio Rossetti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Livije Kalogjera","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University Hospital \"Sestre milosrdnice\" Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Jasminka Persec","author_inst":"University Hospital Dubrava Zagreb, Croatia, University of Zagreb School of Dental Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luke Ollivere","author_inst":"Nottingham University Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ollivere","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huadong Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Digestive System Tumors of Zhejiang Province, Hwamei Hospital, University of Chi"},{"author_name":"Ting Cai","author_inst":"Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guruprasad Aithal","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Mikael Kajova","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Antti Sajantila","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Rafal Wojtowicz","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

'Trained immunity' of the populace as a result of BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning 'trained immunity' or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp.(including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of 'controls' for underlying 'trained immunity'and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samer Singh","author_inst":"Banaras Hindu University Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rajendra P.

We investigate, through extensive simulations, the bias in estimating the hazard ratio (HR) and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of death when competing risks are ignored, and suggest an alternative method. Methods We simulated a fictive clinical trial on COVID-19 mimicking studies investigating interventions such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, or convalescent plasma. The outcome is time from randomization until death. Six scenarios for the effect of treatment on death and recovery were considered. The HR and the 28-day ARR of death were estimated using the Cox PH and the Fine and Gray (FG) models. Estimates were then compared with the true values, and the magnitude of misestimation was quantified. Results The Cox PH model misestimated the true HR and the 28-day ARR of death in the majority of scenarios. The magnitude of misestimation increased when recovery was faster and\/or chance of recovery was higher. In some scenarios, this model has shown a harmful treatment effect when it was beneficial. Estimates obtained from the FG model were all consistent and showed no misestimation or changes in direction. Conclusion There is a substantial risk of misleading results in COVID-19 research if recovery and death due to COVID-19 are not considered as competing risk events. We strongly recommend the use of a competing risk approach to re-analyze relevant published data that have used the Cox PH model.

The majority of these protocols are based on the gold-standard RT-qPCR test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, there is still a widespread lack of testing in the US and many of the clinical diagnostics protocols require extensive human labor and materials, such as RNA extraction kits, that could face supply shortages and present biosafety concerns. Given the need to develop alternative reagents and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing in the face of heightened demand and potential shortages, we have developed a simplified SARS-CoV-2 testing protocol adapted for its use in laboratory research with minimal molecular biology equipment and expertise. The protocol requires minimal BSL1 biosafety level precautions and facilities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean Paz","author_inst":"Charles E.

Methods: We selected studies written in English assessing or discussing decontamination strategies of N95 masks against coronavirus. The search and study screening were performed in PubMed and SCOPUS by two independent researchers. A descriptive analysis was performed considering the study design of included studies. Results: We included nineteen studies. Eight articles were letter to the editors, five were in vitro studies, three were literature reviews, and three were classified as other study designs. The use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the strategies most cited. However, there is a lack of evidence and consensus related to the best method of N95 masks decontamination. Conclusion: The evidence towards decontamination strategies of N95 masks against coronavirus remains scarce. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation seem the current standard for N95 masks decontamination.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Onofre","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Dentistry, IMED, Passo Fundo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Borges","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Giulia Demarco","author_inst":"Post-Graduate Program in Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lara Dotto","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Dentistry, IMED, Passo Fundo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Falk Schwendicke","author_inst":"Department for Operative and Preventive Dentistry, Charite, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Flavio Demarco","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, RS, Brazil and Graduate Program in Dentistry, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, "},{"author_name":"Harald Sourij","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical University of Graz, Austria"},{"author_name":"Ingrid Van Keilegom","author_inst":"ORSTAT, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jason E Stout","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bettinelli","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department -

Design: Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study. Setting: Greater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants: 7,345 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 1 April 2020, including 460 patients (6.3%) who received an antidepressant during the visit. Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and comorbidities), disease severity and other psychotropic medications. The primary analyses were multivariable Cox models with inverse probability weighting. Results: Over a mean follow-up of 18.5 days (SD=27.1), 1,331 patients (18.1%) had a primary end-point event. Unadjusted hazard ratio estimates of the association between antidepressant use and the primary outcome stratified by age (i.e., 18-50, 51-70, 71-80, and 81+) were non-significant (all p>0.072), except in the group of patients aged 71-80 years (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.98; p=0.041). Following adjustments, the primary analyses showed a significant association between use of any antidepressant (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.80; p<0.001), SSRI (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.75; p<0.001), and SNRI (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.96; p=0.034), and reduced risk of intubation or death. Specifically, exposures to escitalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine were significantly associated with lower risk of intubation or death (all p<0.05). These associations remain significant in multiple sensitivity analyses, except for the association between SNRI use and the outcome. Conclusions: SSRI use could be associated with lower risk of death or intubation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of these medications for COVID-19 are needed.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Hoertel","author_inst":"AP-HP ; Paris University ; INSERM ; Institut de Psychiatrie et Neurosciences de Paris."},{"author_name":"Marina SANCHEZ RICO","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Raphael VERNET","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nathanael BEEKER","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie JANNOT","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Antoine NEURAZ","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Elisa SALAMANCA","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas PARIS","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christel DANIEL","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre GRAMFORT","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Guillaume LEMAITRE","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Melodie BERNAUX","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Ali BELLAMINE","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Cedric LEMOGNE","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Guillaume AIRAGNES","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Anita BURGUN","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Frederic LIMOSIN","author_inst":"AP-HP ; Paris University ; INSERM ; Institut de Psychiatrie et Neurosciences de Paris."},{"author_name":"Luke Ollivere","author_inst":"Nottingham University Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ollivere","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huadong Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Digestive System Tumors of Zhejiang Province, Hwamei Hospital, University of Chi"},{"author_name":"Ting Cai","author_inst":"Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guruprasad Aithal","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Mikael Kajova","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Antti Sajantila","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Rafal Wojtowicz","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

To increase the evidence base supporting specific methods to measure social interaction, we compared data from self-reported contact surveys and wearable proximity sensors from a cohort of schoolchildren in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Although the number and type of contacts recorded by each participant differed between the two methods, we found good correspondence between the two methods in aggregate measures of age-specific interactions. Fewer, but longer, contacts were reported in surveys, relative to the generally short proximal interactions captured by wearable sensors. When adjusted for expectations of proportionate mixing, though, the two methods produced highly similar, assortative age-mixing matrices. These aggregate mixing matrices, when used in simulation, resulted in similar estimates of risk of infection by age. While proximity sensors and survey methods may not be interchangeable for capturing individual contacts, they can generate highly correlated data on age-specific mixing patterns relevant to the dynamics of respiratory virus transmission.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyra H.

The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included Version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. We used COVID-19 daily case data to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number R for each of 150 Upper Tier Local Authorities in England, and at the National level, before and after the launch of the programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood methods to estimate R, and compared the Isle of Wight to other areas using a synthetic control method. We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch. These results are robust across each of our approaches. Our results show that the sub-epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled significantly more effectively than the sub-epidemics of most other Upper Tier Local Authorities, changing from having the third highest reproduction number R (of 150) before the intervention to the tenth lowest afterwards. The data is not yet available to establish a causal link. However, the findings highlight the need for further research to determine the causes of this reduction, as these might translate into local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination becomes available.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle Kendall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luke Milsom","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-Dorner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Wymant","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark Briers","author_inst":"Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Chris Holmes","author_inst":"University of Oxford; Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Object: We assessed effectiveness of COCOA. Method: After developing a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model with COCOA and voluntary restrictions against going out (VRG), we assumed that COCOA can reduce infectiousness by 10-50% points through self-quarantine at home after receiving notification from COCOA. Results: COCOA alone is insufficient to halt an outbreak. Even if the entire population were to use COCOA, the reproduction number would be 1.31. However, if VRG were 15%, about half of the maximum VRG effectiveness under the emergency state declaration, then 10% COCOA use by a population can reduce the reproduction number to less than one. Conclusion: Significant effects of COCOA for reducing the reproduction number were found. However, without VRG, COCOA alone is insufficient to control an outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junko Kurita","author_inst":"Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tamie Sugawara","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Ohkusa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Chris Wymant","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark Briers","author_inst":"Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Chris Holmes","author_inst":"University of Oxford; Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

In the present study, we characterized vulnerable populations located in areas at higher risk of COVID-19 related mortality and low critical healthcare capacity in the U.S. Methods Using Bayesian multilevel analysis and small area disease risk mapping, we assessed the spatial variation of COVID-19 related mortality risk for the U.S. in relation with healthcare disparities including race, ethnicity, poverty, air quality, and critical healthcare capacity. Results Overall, highly populated, regional air hub areas, and minorities had an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality. We found that with an increase of only 1 ug\/m3 in long term PM2.5 exposure, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 13%. Counties with major air hubs had 18% increase in COVID-19 related death compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19 related mortality risk were also counties with lower critical care capacity than national average. These counties were primary located at the North- and South-Eastern regions of the country. Conclusion The existing disparity in health and environmental risk factors that exacerbate the COVID-19 related mortality, along with the regional healthcare capacity, determine the vulnerability of populations to COVID-19 related mortality. The results from this study can be used to guide the development of strategies for the identification and targeting preventive strategies in vulnerable populations with a higher proportion of minority groups living in areas with poor air quality and low healthcare capacity.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esteban Correa-Agudelo","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Tesfaye Mersha","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Andres Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Adam J Branscum","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Neil J MacKinnon","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Diego F Cuadros","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Chris Holmes","author_inst":"University of Oxford; Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Different approaches are followed to mitigate its impact and reduce its spreading in different countries, but limiting mobility and exposure have been de-facto precaution to reduce transmission. However, a full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment on a near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates: age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool (www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the framework is scalable across the world. However, personal risk can be assessed immediately from anywhere.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rishi Ram Parajuli","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bhogendra Mishra","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Amrit Banstola","author_inst":"Centre for Academic Child Health, University of the West of England, UK"},{"author_name":"Bhoj Raj Ghimire","author_inst":"Nepal Open University, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shobha Poudel","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kusum Sharma","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sameer Mani Dixit","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sunil Kumar Shah","author_inst":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Teaching Hospital, UK"},{"author_name":"Padam Simkhada","author_inst":"School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield, UK"},{"author_name":"Edwin van Teijlingen","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Bournemouth University, UK"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

We included undergraduate students of the University of Aleppo (Syria). The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Demographics ,knowledge and behaviours . Every participant's knowledge was scored from 0-13 depending on the number of correct answers in the knowledge section. The correctness was judged depending on WHO recommendations at the time of questionnaire administration. P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among this well-educated and predominantly medical and health-related students, 682 (45.4%) students had a good knowledge level, which is somehow disappointing. The current study shows that 1st year students and non-medical specialties students and smokers had significantly lower knowledge levels than others. On contrary, residing with less people -which may indicate a higher socioeconomic status-, was associated with a higher knowledge level. We also found that commitment to preventive measures was in general satisfying and correlated significantly with knowledge level and gender in most cases. Conclusion: Junior students, non-medical specialties, smokers and those who live with high number of people are vulnerable to less knowledge level and awareness campaigns should concentrate on them. Increasing awareness is useful to increase commitment to preventive measures, and groups that have less adherence to preventive measures, as described in detail, should be taken into consideration while designing public health responses. Finally, we should be aware of the negative impact of quarantine on public health to take it into consideration for current campaigns and future policies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"aos mohammed alhamid","author_inst":"university of aleppo"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Mohammed Alhamid","author_inst":"university of aleppo"},{"author_name":"ziad aljarad","author_inst":"Aleppo University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bhoj Raj Ghimire","author_inst":"Nepal Open University, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shobha Poudel","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kusum Sharma","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sameer Mani Dixit","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sunil Kumar Shah","author_inst":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Teaching Hospital, UK"},{"author_name":"Padam Simkhada","author_inst":"School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield, UK"},{"author_name":"Edwin van Teijlingen","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Bournemouth University, UK"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected. Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renzo JC Calderon-Anyosa","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Jay S Kaufman","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"ziad aljarad","author_inst":"Aleppo University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bhoj Raj Ghimire","author_inst":"Nepal Open University, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shobha Poudel","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kusum Sharma","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sameer Mani Dixit","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sunil Kumar Shah","author_inst":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Teaching Hospital, UK"},{"author_name":"Padam Simkhada","author_inst":"School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield, UK"},{"author_name":"Edwin van Teijlingen","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Bournemouth University, UK"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stuart P Weisberg","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Connors","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhu","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Baldwin","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hsuan Lin","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Wontakal","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Peter A Szabo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Steven B Wells","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Pranay Dogra","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joshua I Gray","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Emma Idzikowski","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Francesca Bovier","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Julia Davis-Porada","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Rei Matsumoto","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Maya Meimei Li Poon","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael P Chait","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Cyrille Mathieu","author_inst":"CIRI, International Center for Infectiology Research, Inserm"},{"author_name":"Branka Horvat","author_inst":"CIRI, International Center for Infectiology Research, Inserm"},{"author_name":"Didier Decimo","author_inst":"CIRI, International Center for Infectiology Research, Inserm"},{"author_name":"Zachary C Bitan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Francesca La Carpia","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Ferrara","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Emily Mace","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joshua Milner","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Anne Moscona","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Porotto","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Donna L Farber","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in health-care workers to report evidence of pericarditis and myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We studied 139 health-care workers with confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection (103 diagnosed by RT-PCR and 36 by serology). Participants underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, laboratory tests including immune cell profiling and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Pericarditis was diagnosed when classical criteria were present, and the diagnosis of myocarditis was based on the updated CMR Lake-Louise-Criteria. Results: Median age was 52 years (IQR 41-57), 100 (72%) were women, and 23 (16%) were previously hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. At examination (10.4 [9.3-11.0] weeks after infection-like symptoms), all participants presented hemodynamic stability. Chest pain, dyspnoea or palpitations were observed in 58 (42%) participants; electrocardiographic abnormalities in 69 (50%); NT-pro-BNP was elevated in 11 (8%); troponin in 1 (1%); and CMR abnormalities in 104 (75%). Isolated pericarditis was diagnosed in 4 (3%) participants, myopericarditis in 15 (11%) and isolated myocarditis in 36 (26%). Participants diagnosed by RT-PCR were more likely to still present symptoms than participants diagnosed by serology (73 [71%] vs 18 [50%]; p=0.027); nonetheless, the prevalence of pericarditis or myocarditis was high in both groups (44 [43%] vs 11 [31%]; p=0.238). Most participants (101 [73%]) showed altered immune cell counts in blood, particularly decreased eosinophil (37 [27%]; p<0.001) and increased CD4-CD8-\/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (24 [17%]; p<0.001). Pericarditis was associated with elevated CD4-CD8-\/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (p=0.011), while participants diagnosed with myopericarditis or myocarditis had lower (p<0.05) plasmacytoid dendritic cell, NK-cell and plasma cell counts and lower anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody levels (p=0.027). Conclusions: Pericarditis and myocarditis with clinical stability are frequent long after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in presently asymptomatic subjects. These observations will probably apply to the general population infected and may indicate that cardiac sequelae might occur late in association with an altered (delayed) innate and adaptative immune response.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rocio Eiros","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Manuel Barreiro-Perez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Ana Martin-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Julia Almeida","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Villacorta","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alba Perez-Pons","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Soraya Merchan","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alba Torres-Valle","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Clara Sanchez-Pablo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Gonzalez-Calle","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Oihane Perez-Escurza","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Ines Toranzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Elena Diaz-Pelaez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Blanca Fuentes-Herrero","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Laura Macias-Alvarez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Oliva-Ariza","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Quentin Lecrevisse","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Fluxa","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Jose L Bravo-Grandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alberto Orfao","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro L Sanchez","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Ferrara","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Emily Mace","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joshua Milner","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Anne Moscona","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Porotto","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Donna L Farber","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients' clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. Methods: We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1,037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers' readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. Results: The 1,037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD {+\/-} 17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical\/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients' disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio and albumin\/globulin ratio. Day-1 model's accuracy rate, macro- and micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%-91.3% and 96.0%-95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%-94.2% and 97.8%-97.1% under Day-5 model. Conclusions: Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients' outcome. The model is transformed into a simple online calculator to provide convenient clinical reference tools at the point of care, with an aim to inform clinical decision on triage and step-down care.

Inequalities and burden of comorbidities of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary importantly inside the countries. We aimed to analyze the Municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate of in Mexico. Methods. We retrieved information from 142,643 cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and 18,886 deaths of COVID-19 as of June 20th, 2020 from the publicly available database of the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Public official data of the most recent census and surveys of the country were used to adjust a negative binomial regression model with the quintiles (Q) of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes among 2,457 Municipality-level. Expected Mortality Rates (EMR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported. Results. Factors associated with high MR of COVID-19, relative to Quintile 1 (Q1), were; diabetes prevalence (Q4, IRR=2.60), obesity prevalence (Q5, IRR=1.93), diabetes mortality rate (Q5, IRR=1.58), proportion of indigenous population (Q2, IRR=1.68), proportion of economically active population (Q5, IRR=1.50), density of economic units that operate essential activities (Q4, IRR=1.54) and population density (Q5, IRR=2.12). We identified 1,351 Municipality-level without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had nevertheless high (Q4, Mean EMR= 8.0 deaths per 100,000) and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (Q5, Mean EMR= 13.8 deaths per 100,000). Conclusion. This study identified 1,351 Municipality-level of Mexico that, in spite of not having confirmed COVID-19 deaths yet, share characteristics that could eventually lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warn against premature easing of mobility restrictions. Local information should be used to reinforce strategies of prevention and control of outbreaks in communities vulnerable to COVID-19.

We jointly modelled the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We used changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 1st June, we estimated that Rt was only below one in 23 states.

Recent studies have shown that masks have been effective in several countries and populations, leaving only a lack of quantitative data on the control of airborne dispersion from human exhalation. This current study specifically has the objective to quantify the effectiveness of non-medical grade washable masks or face coverings in controlling airborne dispersion from exhalation (both droplet and aerosol) by measuring changes in direction, particle cloud velocities, and concentration. Design: This randomized effectiveness study used a 10% NaCl nebulized polydisperse particle solution (0.3 um up to 10 um in size) delivered by an exhalation simulator to conduct 94 experiment runs with combinations of 8 different fabrics, 5 mask designs, and airflows for both talking and coughing. Multiple particle sensors were instrumented to measure reduction in aerosol dispersion. Results: Three-way multivariate analysis of variance establishes that fabric, mask design, and exhalation breath level have a statistically significant effect on changing direction, reducing velocity, or concentrations of airborne particles (Fabric: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Mask design: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Breath level: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .004). There were also statistically significant interaction effects between combinations of all primary factors. Conclusions and Relevance: The application of facial coverings or masks can significantly reduce the airborne dispersion of aerosolized particles from exhalation by diffusing the particle cloud direction and slow down its travel speed. Consequently, the results indicate that wearing masks when coupled with social distance can decrease the potentially inhaled dose of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols or droplets especially where infectious contaminants may exist in shared air spaces. The conclusion is well aligned with the concept of \"time-distance-shielding\" from hazardous materials emergency response. However, the effectiveness varies greatly between the specific fabrics and mask designs used.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathan J Edwards","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Widrick","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Richard Potember","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mike Gerschefske","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Mellan","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Helen Coupland","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Ish-Horowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michaela Andrea Christine Vollmer","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Filippi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"M\u00e9lodie Monod","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Ratmann","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fabian Valka","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Iwona Hawryluk","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Milton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kylie E C Ainslie","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nick F Brazeau","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunub\u00e1","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver D Eales","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey W Eaton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sabinee L van Elsland","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Richard G FitzJohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Jeffrey","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Edward Knock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"John Lees","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pierre Nouvellet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Okell","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kris V Parag","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Walters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lilith K Whittles","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil M Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality,1 and COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women.2 We present a case of placental SARS-CoV-2 virus in a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy and mild COVID-19 disease. Methods: A pregnant woman was evaluated at University of Missouri Women and Childrens Hospital. Institutional review board approval was obtained; information was obtained from medical records. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. A gynecological pathologist examined the placenta and performed histolopathology. Sections were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; slides were cut and subjected to hematoxylin-and-eosin or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. IHC was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. Findings: A 29 year-old multigravida presented at 40-4\/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias two days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her parents were in self-isolation for COVID-19 positivity; husband was asymptomatic and tested negative for COVID-19, but exposed to a workplace (meatpacking facility) outbreak. Prenatal course was uncomplicated, with no gestational hypertension. She was afebrile and asymptomatic with normal vital signs throughout hospitalization. Her myalgias improved prior to admission. A liveborn male infant was delivered vaginally. Newborn course was uneventful; he was appropriate for gestational age, physical was unremarkable, and he was discharged home at 36 hours. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative at 24 hours. At one-week follow-up, newborn was breastfeeding well, with no fevers or respiratory distress. Overall placental histology is consistent with acute uterine hypoxia (subchorionic laminar necrosis) superimposed on chronic uterine hypoxia (extra-villous trophoblasts and focal chronic villitis). IHC using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific monoclonal antibody demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antigens throughout the placenta in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and rarely in CK7-expressing trophoblasts. Negative control placenta (November 2019 delivery) and ferret nasal turbinate tissues (not shown) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: In this report, SARS-CoV-2 was found in the placenta, but newborn was COVID-19 negative. Our case shows maternal vascular malperfusion, with no features of fetal vascular malperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental COVID-19 despite mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy (with no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); specifically, this patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her having mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for possible placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and other pregnancy complications) as well as for potential vertical transmission -- especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. Further studies are urgently needed, to determine whether women with mild, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic COVID-19 may have SARS-CoV-2 virus that can cross the placenta, cause fetal vascular malperfusion, and possibly affect the fetus. This raises important public health and public policy questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing on a regular basis throughout pregnancy.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert L.

A systematic search of literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and ERIC) was conducted from 2003 until June 12, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Interventions We included review articles and primary studies that reported on stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs; that primarily focused on women; and that included the percentage or number of women included. All English language studies from any geographical setting where COVID-19 has affected the population were reviewed. Primary and secondary outcome measures Studies reporting on mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs), interventions to support mental health well-being were included. Results Of the 2,803 papers found, 31 were included. The triggers of stress, burnout and depression are grouped under individual-, organizational-, and systems-level factors. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevents anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Conclusions Our preliminary findings show that women HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual level factors such as lack of social support; family status; organizational factors such as access to personal protective equipment or high workload; and systems-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines, and a lack of recognition at work.

Introduction: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained blanket testing rate of [&ge;] 7911 tests\/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of [&ge;] 10028 tests\/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of [&ge;] 4540 tests\/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion: Our model predicts that the current testing rates of {approx} 150\/100,000 population are inadequate to control transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in Lusaka. Active isolation of COVID-19 cases including asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia.

However, most studies thus far are based on hospitalized patients and lack longitudinal follow up. As the majority of COVID-19 cases are not hospitalized, prospective studies of symptoms in the population presenting to primary care are needed. Here, we assess the longitudinal dynamic of clinical symptoms in non-hospitalized individuals prior to and throughout the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Data on symptoms were extracted from electronic health records (EHR) consisting of both results of PCR tests and symptoms recorded by primary care physicians, and linked longitudinal self reported symptoms. Setting The second largest Health Maintenance Organization in Israel , Maccabi Health Services Participants From 1\/3\/2020 to 07\/06\/2020, information on symptoms from either surveys or primary care visits was available for 206,377 individuals, including 2,471 who tested positive for COVID-19. Main Outcomes Longitudinal prevalence of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 infection diagnosed by PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: In adults, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in EHR were cough (11.6%), fever (10.3%), and myalgia (7.7%) and the most prevalent self-reported symptoms were cough (21%), fatigue (19%) and rhinorrhea and\/or nasal congestion (17%). In children, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in the EHR were fever (7%), cough (5.5%) and abdominal pain (2.4%) . Emotional disturbances were documented in 15.9% of the positive adults and 4.2% of the children. Loss of taste and smell, either self-reported or documented by a physician, 3 weeks prior to testing, were the most discriminative symptoms in adults (OR =11.18 and OR=5.47 respectively). Additional symptoms included self reported headache (OR = 2.03) and fatigue (OR = 1.73) and a documentation of syncope, rhinorrhea (OR = 2.09 for both ) and fever (OR= 1.62 ) by a physician. Mean time to recovery was 23.5 +- 9.9 days. Children had a significantly shorter disease duration (21.7 +- 8.8 days, p-value=0.01). Several symptoms, including fatigue, myalgia, runny nose and shortness of breath were reported weeks after recovery. Conclusions As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses rapidly worldwide, obtaining accurate information on symptoms and their progression is of essence. Our study shed light on the full clinical spectrum of symptoms experienced by infected individuals in primary care, and may alert physicians for the possibility of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Barak Mizrahi","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Hagai Rossman","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Nir Kalkstein","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Karni Marcus","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yael Barer","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research and Innovation"},{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Shamir-Stein","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Oliver Ratmann","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fabian Valka","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Iwona Hawryluk","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Milton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kylie E C Ainslie","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nick F Brazeau","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunub\u00e1","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver D Eales","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey W Eaton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sabinee L van Elsland","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Richard G FitzJohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Jeffrey","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Edward Knock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"John Lees","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pierre Nouvellet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Okell","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kris V Parag","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Walters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lilith K Whittles","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil M Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

Hundreds of COVID-19 models have been released. Decision-makers need information about the predictive performance of these models to help select which ones should be used to guide decision-making. Methods: We identified 383 published or publicly released COVID-19 forecasting models. Only seven models met the inclusion criteria of: estimating for five or more countries, providing regular updates, forecasting at least 4 weeks from the model release date, estimating mortality, and providing date-versioned sets of previously estimated forecasts. These models included those produced by: DELPHI-MIT (Delphi), Youyang Gu (YYG), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Imperial College London (Imperial), and three models produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). For each of these models, we examined the median absolute percent error-compared to subsequently observed trends-for weekly and cumulative death forecasts. Errors were stratified by weeks of extrapolation, world region, and month of model estimation. For locations with epidemics showing a clear peak, each model's accuracy was also evaluated in predicting the timing of peak daily mortality. Results: Across models, the median absolute percent error (MAPE) on cumulative deaths for models released in June rose with increased weeks of extrapolation, from 2.3% at one week to 16.3% at six weeks. MAPE at 6 weeks was less than 20% for the IHME-MS-SEIR model (10.2%), YYG (11.1%), LANL (12.6%) and Delphi (19.1%). Across models, MAPE at six weeks were the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (65.3%), and the lowest in high-income countries (8.5%). Median absolute errors (MAE) for peak timing also rose with increased forecasting weeks, from 9 days at one week to 30 days at six weeks. Peak timing MAE at six weeks ranged from 20 days for the IHME Curve Fit model, to 38 days for the LANL model. Interpretation: Four of the models, from IHME, YYG, Delphi and LANL, had less than 20% MAPE at six weeks. Despite the complexities of modelling human behavioural responses and government interventions related to COVID-19, predictions among these better-performing models were surprisingly accurate. Forecasts and alternative scenarios can be a useful input to decision-makers, although users should be aware of increasing errors with a greater amount of extrapolation time, and corresponding steadily widening uncertainty intervals further in the future. The framework and publicly available codebase presented can be routinely used to evaluate the performance of all publicly released models meeting inclusion criteria in the future, and compare current model predictions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Friedman","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Patrick Liu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Emmanuela Gakidou","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"- IHME COVID-19 Model Comparison Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Karni Marcus","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yael Barer","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research and Innovation"},{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Shamir-Stein","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Oliver Ratmann","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fabian Valka","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Iwona Hawryluk","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Milton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kylie E C Ainslie","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nick F Brazeau","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunub\u00e1","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver D Eales","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey W Eaton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sabinee L van Elsland","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Richard G FitzJohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Jeffrey","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Edward Knock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"John Lees","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pierre Nouvellet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Okell","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kris V Parag","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Walters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lilith K Whittles","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil M Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

Here, I model a scenario in which ABO transfusion incompatibility reduces the chance of a patient transmitting the virus to an incompatible recipient. Comparison of model outputs to published data on COVID-19 prevalence indicates that if this scenario holds true, ABO incompatibility may reduce virus transmissibility by 60% or more. Paradoxically, however, targeted vaccination of either high-susceptibility type A or \"super-spreader\" type O individuals is less effective than random vaccination at blocking community spread of the virus. Instead, the key is to maintain blood type diversity amongst the remaining susceptible individuals. I stress that these results illustrate a theoretical model of ABO blood group interaction with virus transmission and require confirmation by observation.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter James Ellis","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Patrick Liu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Emmanuela Gakidou","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"- IHME COVID-19 Model Comparison Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Karni Marcus","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yael Barer","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research and Innovation"},{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Shamir-Stein","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Oliver Ratmann","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fabian Valka","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Iwona Hawryluk","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Milton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kylie E C Ainslie","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nick F Brazeau","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunub\u00e1","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver D Eales","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey W Eaton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sabinee L van Elsland","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Richard G FitzJohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Jeffrey","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Edward Knock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"John Lees","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pierre Nouvellet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Okell","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kris V Parag","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Walters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lilith K Whittles","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil M Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.
