These are the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\/coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19) and the prior human immunodeficiency virus\/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV\/AIDS) pandemics. The literature regarding the confluence of these global plagues expands at pace. A systematic search of the literature considering COVID-19 and HIV co-infection was performed. After five months, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were at least thirty-five studies reported from thirteen countries. These ranged from individual case reports and series to cohort studies. Based on studies that could be extrapolated to the general population, co-infected individuals with suppressed HIV viral loads did not have disproportionate COVID-19 sickness and death. At least four patients, newly diagnosed with HIV recovered from COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that co-infected patients should be treated like the general population. This ongoing living systematic evidence map of contemporary primary SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection research provides a platform for researchers, policy makers, clinicians and others to more quickly discover and build relevant insights.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gwinyai Masukume","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of the Witwatersrand, School of Public Health, Johannesburg, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Witness Mapanga","author_inst":"Non-Communicable Diseases Research (NCDR) Division of the Wits Health Consortium, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Sou"},{"author_name":"Doreen Sindisiwe van Zyl","author_inst":"Private practitioner, Johannesburg, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Ivano Alogna","author_inst":"British Institute of International and Comparative Law"},{"author_name":"Alessio Alogna","author_inst":"Charite University Hospital"},{"author_name":"San-Lin You","author_inst":"Fu Jen catholic university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hiv aids"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20122820","rel_title":"A systematic review of convalescent plasma treatment for COVID19","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20122820","rel_abs":"Background. Transfusion of convalescent immune plasma (CP) is commonly used in epidemics. Several articles now describe clinical report data of CP for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease. Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted using the NCBI curated COVID-19 related open-resource literature database LitCovid to identify studies using CP as treatment for COVID-19 patients. We retrieved and curated all COVID-19 related patient and treatment characteristics from previously reported studies. A Poisson model was developed to evaluate the association between age of the patients, older age being the most common risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, and recovery time since CP treatment using data extracted from the literature. Results. From 18,293 identified COVID-19 related articles, we included ten studies reporting results of CP treatment for COVID-19 from a total of 61 patients. Decreased symptoms of severe COVID-19 and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were the most direct observations. We found that patients over the age of sixty who received CP treatment for COVID-19 had a significantly prolonged recovery estimated by viral clearance (from 10 to 29 days since first dose of CP) compared to younger patients, who recovered from the infection in less than a week after receiving CP treatment. Conclusions. Limited published results on plasma transfusion treatment for COVID-19 disease with concomitant treatments suggest that CP therapy for COVID-19 is well tolerated and effective. First randomized clinical trial results, however, reveal no improvements in recovery time for elderly patients with severe COVID-19 between standard treatment alone and added with convalescent plasma. Accordingly, we argue that older patients may need a significantly longer time for recovery. Further randomized clinical trial data for COVID-19 with rigorous ethical standards is urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ville N Pimenoff","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Miriam Elfstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Joakim Dillner","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ivano Alogna","author_inst":"British Institute of International and Comparative Law"},{"author_name":"Alessio Alogna","author_inst":"Charite University Hospital"},{"author_name":"San-Lin You","author_inst":"Fu Jen catholic university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20122689","rel_title":"The impact of COVID-19 control measures on social contacts and transmission in Kenyan informal settlements","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20122689","rel_abs":"Background Many low- and middle-income countries have implemented control measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number (R0). Methods We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, four weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7pm and 5am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R0. Findings We estimate that control measures reduced physical and non-physical contacts, reducing the R0 from around 2.6 to between 0.5 and 0.7, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. 86% of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food. Interpretation COVID-19 control measures have had a large impact on direct contacts and therefore transmission, but have also caused considerable economic and food insecurity. Reductions in R0 are consistent with the linear epidemic growth in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries that implemented similar, early control measures. However, negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Quaife","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kashvi Shah","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicky McCreesh","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mwanga","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Beth Kangwana","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Jessie Pinchoff","author_inst":"Population Council, USA"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20121962","rel_title":"TRACKing Excess Deaths (TRACKED): an interactive online tool to monitor excess deaths associated with COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20121962","rel_abs":"Aim: We aimed to describe trends of excess mortality in the United Kingdom (UK) stratified by nation and cause of death, and to develop an online tool for reporting the most up to date data on excess mortality. Methods: Population statistics agencies in the UK including the Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Records of Scotland (NRS), and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) publish weekly data on deaths. We used mortality data up to 22nd May in the ONS and the NISRA and 24th May in the NRS. Crude mortality for non-COVID deaths (where there is no mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate) calculated. Excess mortality defined as difference between observed mortality and expected average of mortality from previous 5 years. Results: There were 56,961 excess deaths and 8,986 were non-COVID excess deaths. England had the highest number of excess deaths per 100,000 population (85) and Northern Ireland the lowest (34). Non-COVID mortality increased from 23rd March and returned to the 5-year average on 10th May. In Scotland, where underlying cause mortality data besides COVID-related deaths was available, the percentage excess over the 8-week period when COVID-related mortality peaked was: dementia 49%, other causes 21%, circulatory diseases 10%, and cancer 5%. We developed an online tool (TRACKing Excess Deaths - TRACKED) to allow dynamic exploration and visualisation of the latest mortality trends. Conclusions: Continuous monitoring of excess mortality trends and further integration of age- and gender-stratified and underlying cause of death data beyond COVID-19 will allow dynamic assessment of the impacts of indirect and direct mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul M Brennan","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kai Jin","author_inst":"Brain Tumour Centre of Excellence, Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mwanga","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Beth Kangwana","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Jessie Pinchoff","author_inst":"Population Council, USA"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123018","rel_title":"Is the psychological well-being of a population associated with COVID-19 related survival?","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123018","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE Immunological mind-body research suggests mental health may also be important in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of mental health as a protective factor for COVID-19 related mortality in the general population. The second goal was to examine this among populations of countries most affected by COVID-19 related mortality. METHODS Data sources were the Global Burden of Disease report 2017 and publicly reported situational reports of COVID-19. We described variables; calculated the spearman's correlation coefficient, calculated the percentage of the variability of the data that is explained by the association. We explored inter-relationships among other variables: aged 70 or older, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. A correlation matrix with plotted scatter matrix diagrams was produced. RESULTS Across 181 countries, the mean total COVID-19 related survivors per million was 999,949 (sd=125), median=999,993. The variable had a lognormal distribution; the mean mentally healthy per 100,000 was 85,411 (sd=1,871), median=85,634. The test of normality resulted in p-value < 0.001. Correlation of mentally healthy per 100,0000 and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was s=0.29 (n=181, 95% CI 0.16-0.43). The variance explained by the relation between mental healthy and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was 8.4% (2.6-18.5%). Across countries most affected by COVID-19 related mortality s=0.49 (n=45, 0.28-0.70), explaining 24.2% (7.7-49.3%). CONCLUSION A weak association was found between the psychological well-being of a population and COVID-19 related survival. This relationship explained between 2.6 and 18.5% of COVID-19 related survival. For countries most affected by COVID-19 related death, this association was moderate and explained between 7.7 and 49.3%. Confirmation of these important observational findings is needed with future individual patient data research.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederik Feys","author_inst":"Independent researcher"},{"author_name":"Paul M Brennan","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kai Jin","author_inst":"Brain Tumour Centre of Excellence, Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mwanga","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Beth Kangwana","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Jessie Pinchoff","author_inst":"Population Council, USA"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20122226","rel_title":"Different adiposity measures across sex, age, ethnicity, and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20122226","rel_abs":"We examined the link between BMI and risk of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and risk of COVID-19-related death among UK Biobank participants.

Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. BMI was associated strongly with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID-19 related death (Pinteraction=0.03). BMI was more strongly related to test positivity (Pinteraction=0.010) and death (Pinteraction=0.002) in non-whites, compared with whites. These data add support for adiposity being more strongly linked to COVID-19-related deaths in younger people and non-white ethnicities.

Meteorological factors alone, including the associated behavior, do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be allergenic, it plays a role in immuno-activation and defense against respiratory viruses, and seems to create a bio-aerosol that lowers the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, in combination with meteorological variables. We have tested the Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in the Netherlands, with its 17.4 million inhabitants. We combined changes in flu-like incidence per 100K\/Dutch residents (code: ILI) with pollen concentrations and meteorological data. Finally, a predictive model was tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values, inversely correlated to flu-like incidence. We found a highly significant inverse correlation of r(224)= -0.41 (p < 0.001) between pollen and changes in flu-like incidence, corrected for the incubation period. The correlation was stronger after taking into account the incubation time. We found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu-like incidence of r(222) = -0.48 (p < 0.001) when average thresholds of 610 total pollen grains\/m3, 120 allergenic pollen grains\/m3, and a solar radiation of 510 J\/cm2 are passed. The passing of at least the pollen thresholds, preludes the beginning and end of flu-like seasons. Solar radiation is a co-inhibitor of flu-like incidence, while temperature makes no difference. However, higher relative humidity increases with flu-like incidence. We conclude that pollen is a predictor of the inverse seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, and that solar radiation is a co-inhibitor.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martijn J Hoogeveen","author_inst":"Open University Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric CM Van Gorp","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ellen K Hoogeveen","author_inst":"Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Nazim Ghouri","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Stuart R Gray","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Celis-Morales","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Colin Berry","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John JV McMurray","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Austrian","author_inst":"Population Council, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123372","rel_title":"Containment of future waves of COVID-19: simulating the impact of different policies and testing capacities for contact tracing, testing, and isolation","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123372","rel_abs":"We used multi-agents simulations to estimate the testing capacity required to find and isolate a number of infections sufficient to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads within human organs is crucial for developing strategies to prevent viral dissemination. For many viruses, tissue tropism is determined by the availability of virus receptors on the surface of host cells2. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host receptor, yet, their tropisms differ3-5. Here, we found that the cellular receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1), known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, significantly potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, which was inhibited by a monoclonal blocking antibody against the extracellular b1b2 domain of NRP1. NRP1 is abundantly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with highest expression in endothelial cells and in the epithelial cells facing the nasal cavity. Neuropathological analysis of human COVID-19 autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 infected NRP1-positive cells in the olfactory epithelium and bulb. In the olfactory bulb infection was detected particularly within NRP1-positive endothelial cells of small capillaries and medium-sized vessels. Studies in mice demonstrated, after intranasal application, NRP1-mediated transport of virus-sized particles into the central nervous system. Thus, NRP1 could explain the enhanced tropism and spreading of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ludovico Cantuti-Castelvetri","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Ravi Ohja","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Liliana Pedro","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Minou Djannatian","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Jonas Franz","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Suvi Kuivanen","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Katri Kallio","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tugberg Kaya","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Maria Anastasina","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Teemu Smura","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Lev Levanov","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Leonora Szirovicza","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Allan Tobi","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Hannimari Kallio-Kokko","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Pamela Osterlund","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Merja Joensuu","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.138149","rel_title":"Rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with Deep-UV LED irradiation","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.138149","rel_abs":"The spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections worldwide has raised concerns about the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2.

There is an urgent need for developing effective drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 caused ARDS. However, most researchers cannot perform SARS-CoV-2 related researches due to lacking P3 or P4 facility. We developed a non-infectious, highly safety, time-saving SARS-CoV-2 components induced murine model to study the SARS-CoV-2 caused ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). We also investigated mAbs and inhibitors which potentially neutralize the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19, and found that anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF, anti-GM-CSF mAbs, p38 inhibitor, and JAK inhibitor partially relieved CSS. Besides, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF, anti-GM-CSF mAbs and inhibitors of p38, ERK, and MPO somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung. In all, we established the murine model mimic of COVID-19, opening a biosafety and less time-consuming avenue for clarifying the mechanism of ARDS and CSS in COVID-19 and developing the therapeutic drugs.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingxuan Gu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Simin Zhao","author_inst":"Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guoguo Jin","author_inst":"The Henan Luoyang Orthopedic Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengqiu Song","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yafei Zhi","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Ran Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fayang Ma","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaqiu Zheng","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Keke Wang","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Xin","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Wei Han","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Dong","author_inst":"Wartburg College, Waverly, IA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kangdong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zigang Dong","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.07.138800","rel_title":"Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from Bangladesh: insights into the origin, mutation spectrum, and possible pathomechanism","rel_date":"2020-06-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.07.138800","rel_abs":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), rages across the world, killing hundreds of thousands and infecting millions, researchers are racing against time to elucidate the viral genome.

Studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being carried out at an unprecedented rate to tackle this threat. Genomics studies, in particular, are indispensable to elucidate the dynamic nature of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. RNA viruses are marked by their unique ability to undergo high rates of mutation in their genome, much more frequently than their hosts, which diversifies their strengths qualifying them to elude host immune response and amplify drug resistance. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genomic information of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from two infected Indian patients and explored the possible implications of point mutations in its biology. In addition to multiple point mutations, we found a remarkable similarity between relatively common mutations of 36-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2. Our results corroborate with the earlier reported 29-nucleotide deletion in SARS, which was frequent during the early stage of human-to-human transmission. The results will be useful to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and itsattenuation for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shubham Gaurav","author_inst":"IIT Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Shambhavi Pandey","author_inst":"IITG"},{"author_name":"Apurvasinh Puvar","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Tejas Shah","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Madhvi Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Yaqiu Zheng","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Keke Wang","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Xin","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Wei Han","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Dong","author_inst":"Wartburg College, Waverly, IA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kangdong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zigang Dong","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20116012","rel_title":"Cremation based estimates suggest significant under- and delayed reporting of COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and China","rel_date":"2020-06-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20116012","rel_abs":"Background: Epidemiological data provide important information for decision making. COVID-19 statistics from China fall outside of recognized and accepted medical norms. As the epicenter of the COVID-19 initial outbreak, the epidemiological information from Wuhan affects the response and preparation of other parts of China and rest of the world. Here we estimated the incidence, death and starting time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and China based on medical literature from China, official and non-official Chinese data sources. Methods: Data sources included literature on COVID-19 in China, official Chinese government figures, state-run and non state-run media reports. Our estimates are based on investigative media reports of crematory operations in Wuhan, which is considered as a common data end point to life. A range of estimates is presented by an exponential growth rate model from lockdown (Jan 23,2020) until the intervention started to show effects, which was estimated 14.5 days after lockdown. Results: For the cumulative infections and total deaths, under different assumptions of death rates (from 2.5% to 10%) and doubling time 6.4 days, the estimates projected on February 7, 2020 in Wuhan range from 305,000 to 1,272,000 for infections and from 6,811 to 7,223 for deaths - on the order of at least 10 times the official figures (13,603 and 545). The implied starting time of the outbreak is October 2019. Under the assumption of the official 3.14% death rate and doubling time of 2.54 days (which was derived based on Chinese official data), the infection cases reached 2.2 million on February 7. The estimates of cumulative deaths, based on both funeral urns distribution and continuous full capacity operation of cremation services up to March 23, 2020, give results around 36,000, more than 10 times of the official death toll of 2,524. Conclusions: Our study indicates a significant under-reporting in Chinese official data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. The magnitude of discrepancy between our estimates based on cremation related data and Chinese official figures in early February, the critical time for response to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests the need to reevaluate official statistics from China and consider all available and reasonable data sources for a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mai He","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"AT&T, Bedminster, NJ 07921, USA"},{"author_name":"Louis P Dehner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Immunology"},{"author_name":"Lucia Dunn","author_inst":"Department of Economics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA"},{"author_name":"Madhvi Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Joshi","author_inst":"GBRC"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Yaqiu Zheng","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Keke Wang","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Xin","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Wei Han","author_inst":"China-US(Henan)Hormel cancer institute"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Dong","author_inst":"Wartburg College, Waverly, IA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kangdong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zigang Dong","author_inst":"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Frederic Meunier","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Butcher","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Winkler","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Brit Mollenhauer","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Ozgun Gokce","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121558","rel_title":"Multicenter point-prevalence evaluation of the utilization and safety of drug therapies for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121558","rel_abs":"Background: There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of COVID-19. At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period. Methods: We conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected\/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19 targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Results: A total of 352 patients from 15 US hospitals were included. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 inhibitors (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. Patients with a history of asthma (14.9% vs. 7%, p=0.037) and those enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs. 3.2%, p<0.001) were more likely to receive therapy. Among those receiving COVID-19 therapy, eight patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were more commonly recognized in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%, OR=5.9, p=0.028). Conclusions: While we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug therapy including in clinical trials.

Thus, it is essential to improve our understanding of COVID-19 transmission and develop more focused and effective strategies. As human mobility drives transmission, data from cell phone devices can be utilized to achieve these goals. Methods: We analyzed aggregated and anonymized mobility data from the cell-phone devices of>3 million users between February 1, 2020, to May 16, 2020 - in which several movement restrictions were applied and lifted in Israel. We integrated these mobility patterns into age-, risk- and region-structured transmission model. Calibrated to coronavirus incidence in 250 regions covering Israel, we evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness in decreasing mortality of applying localized and temporal lockdowns (stay-at-home order). Results: Poorer regions exhibited lower and slower compliance with the restrictions. Our transmission model further indicated that individuals from poverty areas were associated with high transmission rates. Model projections suggested that, counterintuitively, school closure has an adverse effect and increases COVID-19 mortality in the long run, while interventions focusing on the elderly are the most efficient. We also found that applying localized and temporal lockdowns during regional outbreaks reduce mortality compared to nationwide lockdowns. These trends were consistent across vast ranges of epidemiological parameters, possible seasonal forcing, and even when we assumed that vaccination would be commercially available in 1-3 years.

Among them, neutralizing antibodies play crucial roles for preventing viral infections and contribute to resolution of infection. Here, we describe the generation of antibody libraries from 17 different COVID-19 recovered patients and screening of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. After 3 rounds of panning, 456 positive phage clones were obtained with high affinity to RBD (receptor binding domain). Then the positive clones were sequenced and reconstituted into whole human IgG for epitope binning assays. After that, all 19 IgG were classified into 6 different epitope groups or Bins. Although all these antibodies were shown to have ability to bind RBD, the antibodies in Bin2 have more superiority to inhibit the interaction between spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Most importantly, the antibodies from Bin2 can also strongly bind with mutant RBDs (W463R, R408I, N354D, V367F and N354D\/D364Y) derived from SARS-CoV-2 strain with increased infectivity, suggesting the great potential of these antibodies in preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations. Furthermore, these neutralizing antibodies strongly restrict the binding of RBD to hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. Consistently, these antibodies effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry into hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. In Vero-E6 cells, these antibodies can even block the entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells at only 12.5 nM. These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Lou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Haitao Wei","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Min Chu","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ruihua Chao","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Hangping Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Xiulan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120337","rel_title":"Belief of Previous COVID-19 Infection and Unclear Government Policy are Associated with Reduced Willingness to Participate in App-Based Contact Tracing: A UK-Wide Observational Study of 13,000 Patients","rel_date":"2020-06-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120337","rel_abs":"Background: Contact tracing and lockdown are health policies being used worldwide to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19). While easing lockdown, the UK National Health Service (NHS) launched its Track and Trace Service at the end of May 2020, and aims by end of June 2020 also to include app-based notification and advice to self-isolate for those who have been in contact with a person known to have COVID-19. To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. Objectives: To measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE) - the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Methods: Observational study of 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% of whom completed a novel questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation -- related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. Results: 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded \"no\", 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6\/10 (OR for 1-2\/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48 - 0.67]; OR for 3-4\/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64 - 0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app; belief of previous recovery from COVID-19 infection OR 0.727 [0.585 - 0.908]). Conclusions: In this large UK-wide questionnaire of wellbeing in lockdown, a willingness for app-based contact tracing is 60% - close to the estimated 56% population uptake, and substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for an app-based contact-tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic. Given this marginal level of support over an appropriate age range, the impacts of difficulty comprehending government advice and a policy of not testing to confirm self-reported COVID-19 infection during lockdown indicate that uncertainty in communication and diagnosis in adopted public health policies will negatively impact the effectiveness of a government contact tracing app.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrik Bachtiger","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexander Adamson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Quint","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ruihua Chao","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Hangping Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Xiulan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114009","rel_title":"How Should Clinicians Interpret Imprecise Trials Assessing Drugs for COVID-19 Patients?","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114009","rel_abs":"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, researchers are reporting findings of randomized trials comparing standard care with care augmented by experimental drugs. The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles F.

Symptoms were in less than 10% and comorbidities were in 4-8%. History of BCG vaccination was in 49% cases vs 10% controls. Cases compared to controls had significantly greater white cell (6.96+1.89 vs 6.12+1.69x109 cells\/L) and lower lymphocyte count (1.98+0.79 vs 2.32+0.91x109 cells\/L). No radiological and electrocardiographic abnormality was observed. All these were isolated or quarantined in the hospital and observed. Covid-19 patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin according to prevalent guidelines. One patient needed oxygen support while hospital course was uncomplicated in the rest. All were discharged alive. Conversion to virus negative status was in 10.2+6.4 days and was significantly lower in age >40y (9.1+5.2) compared to 40-59y (11.3+6.1) and >60y (16.4+13.3) (p=0.001). Conclusions: This hospital-based registry shows that mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic young covid-19 patients have excellent prognosis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arvind Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Asrar Ahmed","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Medical Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Vaseem Naheed Baig","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Prahalad Dhakad","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Dalela","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Sudhanshu Kacker","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Vasim Raja Panwar","author_inst":"Rajasthan Dental College, Bagru, Jaipur 302026 India"},{"author_name":"Raja Babu Panwar","author_inst":"Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Gupta","author_inst":"Eternal Heart Care Centre & Research Institute, Jaipur 302017 India"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20067793","rel_title":"Augmenting contact matrices with time-use data for fine-grained intervention modelling of disease dynamics: A modelling analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20067793","rel_abs":"Background: Social distancing is an important public health intervention to reduce or interrupt the sustained community transmission of emerging infectious pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to explore the impact on the epidemic curve of fewer contacts when individuals reduce the time they spend on selected daily activities. Methods: We combined the large-scale empirical data of a social contact survey and a time-use survey to estimate contact matrices by age group (0-15, 16-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+) and daily activity (work, schooling, transportation, and four leisure activities: social visits, bar\/cafe\/restaurant visits, park visits, and non-essential shopping). We assumed that reductions in time are proportional to reductions in contacts. The derived matrices were then applied in an age-structured dynamic-transmission model of COVID-19 to explore the effects. Findings: The relative reductions in the derived contact matrices were highest when closing schools (in ages 0-14 years), workplaces (15-64 years), and stopping social visits (65+ years). For COVID-19, the closure of workplaces, schools, and stopping social visits had the largest impact on reducing the epidemic curve and delaying its peak, while the predicted impact of fewer contacts in parks, bars\/cafes\/restaurants, and non-essential shopping were minimal. Interpretation: We successfully augmented contact matrices with time-use data to predict the highest impact of social distancing measures from reduced contacts when spending less time at work, school, and on social visits. Although the predicted impact from other leisure activities with potential for close physical contact were minimal, changes in mixing patterns and time-use immediately after re-allowing social activities may pose increased short-term transmission risks, especially in potentially crowded environments indoors.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edwin van Leeuwen","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"- PHE Joint modelling group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Frank Sandmann","author_inst":"Public Health England; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Prahalad Dhakad","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Dalela","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Sudhanshu Kacker","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Vasim Raja Panwar","author_inst":"Rajasthan Dental College, Bagru, Jaipur 302026 India"},{"author_name":"Raja Babu Panwar","author_inst":"Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Gupta","author_inst":"Eternal Heart Care Centre & Research Institute, Jaipur 302017 India"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20114967","rel_title":"Paediatric Dentistry and the coronavirus (COVID-19) response in the North East of England and North Cumbria","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20114967","rel_abs":"Introduction: Coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically changed the landscape of dentistry including Paediatric Dentistry. This paper explores paediatric patient data within a wider service evaluation completed within an Urgent Dental Care Centre in the North East of England and North Cumbria over a 6-week period. Aim: To assess demand for the service, patient demographics and inform paediatric urgent dental care pathways. Main outcome methods: Data collected included key characteristics of paediatric patients accessing Paediatric Dental Services from 23rd March to 3rd May 2020. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Results: There were 369 consultations (207 telephone, 124 face-to-face and 38 Out of Hours consultations). The mean age of children accessing the service was 7 years old. 7% of those attending face-to-face visits were reattenders. The most common diagnoses were irreversible pulpitis and dental trauma. 49% of face-to-face consultations resulted in extractions, 28% with General Anaesthetic, and 21% with Local Anaesthetic. Conclusion: Management of dental emergencies provided by the Urgent Dental Care Centre for paediatric patients has largely been effective and confirmed the efficacy of patient pathways established.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Simpsons","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sumner II","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday III","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Charlotte C Currie IV","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Virginia Hind V","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicola Lush","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucy Burbridge","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ben Cole","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Gupta","author_inst":"Eternal Heart Care Centre & Research Institute, Jaipur 302017 India"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"University of Goettingen"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Balistreri","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Mikael Simons","author_inst":"TU Munich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"dentistry and oral medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119149","rel_title":"Tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods: A multicentre, single-arm, hypothesis-driven phase 2 trial was planned to study the effect of Tocilizumab on lethality rates at 14 and 30 days (co-primary endpoints). A cohort of patients consecutively enrolled after phase 2 was used as a validation dataset. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to generate hypotheses, while controlling for possible confounders. Results: out of 301 patients in phase 2 intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 180 (59.8%) received tocilizumab. With 67 death events, lethality rates were 18.4% (97.5%CI: 13.6-24.0, P=0.52) and 22.4% (97.5%CI: 17.2-28.3, P<0.001) at 14 and 30 days. Lethality rates were lower in the validation dataset, including 920 patients. No signal of specific drug toxicity was reported. The multivariable logistic regression suggests tocilizumab might be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline. Also, it supports a positive effect on lethality rate of the use of corticosteroids. Conclusions: Tocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 days compared with null hypothesis, without significant toxicity. Such result support the use of tocilizumab while waiting for ongoing phase 3 trials.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Perrone","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, IRCCS, Fondazione G.

Study design: National cross sectional community survey. Setting: Australian general public. Participants: Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362). Main outcome measures: Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and socio-demographic factors. Results: People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p<0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59% vs 72%; p<0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. They were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5, p<0.001) and reported more difficulty remembering\/accessing medication since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7, p<0.001). Importantly there was higher endorsement of misinformation beliefs related to COVID-19 and vaccination in people with lower health literacy. Similar results were observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home. Conclusion: Our findings show important disparities by health literacy and language in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. Those with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19. Addressing the health literacy needs of the community in public health messaging about COVID-19 must now be a priority in Australia.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsten McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rachael H Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Erin Cvejic","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Julie Ayre","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carys Batcup","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MJ Isautier","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tessa Copp","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carissa Bonner","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Michael S Wolf","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Castelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia"},{"author_name":"Maria Lorenza Muiesan","author_inst":"University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lichtner","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome, Santa Maria Goretti Hospital, Latina"},{"author_name":"Carlo Calzetti","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases and Hepatology Unit AOU Parma"},{"author_name":"Nicola Duccio Salerno","author_inst":"UOC Malattie Infettive e Tropicali, AOUI, Verona"},{"author_name":"Luigi Atripaldi","author_inst":"Cotugno Hospital, AORN Ospedali dei Colli, Napoli"},{"author_name":"Marco Cascella","author_inst":"Anesthesia and Resuscitation Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, IRCCS, Fondazione G.

SENA is highly sensitive, with its limit of detection being at least 2 copies\/reaction lower than that of the corresponding rRT-PCR, and highly specific, which identifies both false-negative and false-positive cases in clinic applications.
