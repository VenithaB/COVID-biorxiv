The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual patients.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/121889v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dccedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1190e1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee2e67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@289f72_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea R Daamen","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Prathyusha Bachali","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Katherine A Owen","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Kathryn M Kingsmore","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Erika L Hubbard","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Adam C Labonte","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Robert Robl","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Sneha Shrotri","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Amrie C Grammer","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Peter E Lipsky","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.120121","rel_title":"Evidence for anti-viral effects of complete Freunds adjuvant in the mouse model of enterovirus infection","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.120121","rel_abs":"Group B Coxsackieviruses belonging to the genus, Enterovirus, contain six serotypes that induce various diseases, whose occurrence may involve the mediation of more than one serotype. We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB infections. These observations may provide new insights into our understanding of the occurrence of viral infections. One example is Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as individuals suffering from COVID-19 who have been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin appear to have fewer morbidities and mortalities than unvaccinated individuals.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunakumar Gangaplara","author_inst":"Laboratory of Early Sickle Mortality Prevention, Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of H"},{"author_name":"Chandirasegaran Massilamany","author_inst":"CRISPR Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Ninaad Lasrado","author_inst":"University of Nebraska - Lincoln"},{"author_name":"David Steffen","author_inst":"University of Nebraska - Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Jay Reddy","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Adam C Labonte","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Robert Robl","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Sneha Shrotri","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Amrie C Grammer","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Peter E Lipsky","author_inst":"AMPEL BioSolutions"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.120444","rel_title":"Assessment of Inactivation Procedures for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.120444","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents a challenge to laboratorians and healthcare workers around the world. Handling of biological samples from individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires strict biosafety and biosecurity measures. Within the laboratory, non-propagative work with samples containing the virus requires, at minimum, Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) techniques and facilities. Therefore, handling of SARS-CoV-2 samples remains a major concern in areas and conditions where biosafety and biosecurity for specimen handling is difficult to maintain, such as in rural laboratories or austere field testing sites. Inactivation through physical or chemical means can reduce the risk of handling live virus and increase testing ability worldwide. Herein we assess several chemical and physical inactivation techniques employed against SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Cambodian COVID-19 patients.

However, the immunopathological changes of key types of immune cells during and after virus infection remain unclear. Here, we enriched CD3+ and CD19+ lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 patients (severe patients and recovered patients at early or late stages) and healthy people (SARS-CoV-2 negative) and revealed transcriptional profiles and changes in these lymphocytes by comprehensive single-cell transcriptome and V(D)J recombination analyses. We found that although the T lymphocytes were decreased in the blood of patients with virus infection, the remaining T cells still highly expressed inflammatory genes and persisted for a while after recovery in patients. We also observed the potential transition from effector CD8 T cells to central memory T cells in recovered patients at the late stage. Among B lymphocytes, we analyzed the expansion trajectory of a subtype of plasma cells in severe COVID-19 patients and traced the source as atypical memory B cells (AMBCs). Additional BCR and TCR analyses revealed a high level of clonal expansion in patients with severe COVID-19, especially of B lymphocytes, and the clonally expanded B cells highly expressed genes related to inflammatory responses and lymphocyte activation. V-J gene usage and clonal types of higher frequency in COVID-19 patients were also summarized.

However, hospitals in developing countries often cannot measure some of the variables that have been reported as useful. - Objective: To assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the novel LOW-HARM score (Lymphopenia, Oxygen saturation, White blood cells, Hypertension, Age, Renal injury, and Myocardial injury). - Design: Demographic and clinical data from patients with known clinical outcomes (death or discharge) was obtained. Patients were grouped according to their outcome. The LOW-HARM score was calculated for each patient and its distribution, potential cut-off values and demographic data were compared. - Setting: Twelve hospitals in ten different cities in Mexico. - Participants: Data from 438 patients was collected. A total of 400 (200 per group) was included in the analysis. - Exposure: All patients had an infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR. - Main Outcome: The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of different cut-offs of the LOW-HARM score to predict death. - Results: Mean scores at admission and their distributions were significantly lower in patients who were discharged compared to those who died during their hospitalization 10 (SD: 17) vs 70 (SD: 28). The overall AUC of the model was 95%. A cut-off > 65 points had a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 96%. More than a third of the cases (36%) in the sample had a LOW-HARM score > 65 points. - Conclusions and relevance: The LOW-HARM score measured at admission is highly specific and useful for predicting mortality. It is easy to calculate and can be updated with individual clinical progression.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Soto-Mota","author_inst":"The University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Braulio A.

To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 in a real-world social network generated from high resolution GPS data3,4. We found that tracing contacts-of-contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only contacts, but resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting that contact tracing and quarantine may be most effective when it acts as a \"local lockdown\" when contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals.

In many European countries and the US, the burden of Covid-19 epidemic could be much lower if Governments had been able to learn from the China and Lombardy stories and to declare full lockdown without delays. Methods. We use a simple game-theoretic framework for the strategic interaction between the Government, political oppositions and lobbies, combined with a Covid-19 transmission model, to analyse the role of political factors delaying the lockdown declaration, depending on the degrees of \"responsibility\" of political actors. Results. The lockdown can always be declared immediately (i.e., without delay) as sustained transmission arises, only if the government feels fully \"responsible\" towards all citizens. If this is not the case, epidemic growth will eventually dominate the agents' payoffs, so that sooner or later the lockdown will always be declared i.e., both the government and the opposition will be forced by the epidemic to switch towards a higher degree of responsibility, but with a delay. There is a further nontrivial situation where the lockdown can be declared without delay, occurring when the political opposition is at least as responsible as the Government. This however requires the solution of a coordination issue, which cannot be taken for granted. Eventually, a vicious circle emerges, where the delayed lockdown requires a much longer lockdown period to achieve adequate control results, thereby causing the explosion of economic losses and so calling for unlocking long before it should. Conclusions. Lockdown delays have dramatically worsened the impact of the current Covid-19 wave in a number of countries. Citizens should be made cogently aware of this to claim maximal responsibility from political actors and economic lobbies to avoid that such stories repeat in the future when further threats, due to Covid-19 itself or other pathogens, will re-appear.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessio Carrozzo Magli","author_inst":"Alma Mater Studiorum"},{"author_name":"Alberto d'Onofrio","author_inst":"Stratchclyde University, Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Piero Manfredi","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timoteo Carletti","author_inst":"University of Namur"},{"author_name":"Duccio Fanelli","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Francesco Piazza","author_inst":"University of Orleans"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Design\/setting: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019 through February 2020) versus after (April 2020) the lockdown. Participants: 20,558 adults ([&ge;]16y). Measurements: The independent variable was the timing of the Covid-19 lockdown in England (before vs. after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking; past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers); past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers); and use of evidence-based (e.g., prescription medication\/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support (telephone support\/websites\/apps) for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers\/high-risk drinkers who made a quit\/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region, and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). Findings: The Covid-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence (17.0% (after) vs. 15.9% (before), OR=1.09[95%CI 0.95-1.24]), but was associated with increases in the rate of quit attempts (39.6% vs. 29.1%, ORadj=1.56[1.23-1.98]) and cessation (8.8% vs. 4.1%, ORadj=2.63[1.69-4.09]) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0% vs. 51.5%, ORadj=1.10[0.72-1.68]) but use of remote support increased (10.9% vs. 2.7%, ORadj=3.59[1.56-8.23]). Lockdown was associated with increases in the prevalence of high-risk drinking (38.3% vs. 25.1%, OR=1.85[1.67-2.06]) but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5% vs. 15.3%, ORadj=2.16[1.77-2.64]). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2% vs. 4.0%, ORadj=0.23[0.05-0.97]) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9% vs. 6.1%, ORadj=1.32[0.64-2.75]). Conclusions: In England, prevalence of high-risk drinking but not smoking has increased since the Covid-19 lockdown. Smokers and high-risk drinkers are more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce their alcohol consumption, and rates of smoking cessation are higher.

Based on the notion of interventions-lifting we classify and evaluate the scenarios by five attributes (indicators): amount of interventions-lifting, death numbers, Public Health Care capacity, population immunity, peak dates of infections. For quantitative reasoning we use a simulated modified SEIR-model calibrated with actual data. We identify margins for intervention-liftings wrt. 13.05.2020 and discuss the relation to the effective reproduction number with a 6d-generation time . We show that, in order to constrain death numbers comparable to a strong Influenza epidemic, there is only a small corridor of 16% of possible liftings, with an additional 4% margin contributed by automated contact tracing. We show also that there is a much broader corridor of 50%+18%, though not overloading critical Public Health Care capacity, implying high death numbers.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Kempf","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Claire Garnett","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Lion Shahab","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Melissa Oldham","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Jamie Brown","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lewis G.

Contact tracing via case-by-case interviews is effective when contacts are known and outbreaks are small. Smartphone applications that keep track of contacts between users offer the possibility to scale contact tracing to larger outbreaks with minimal notification delays. While the benefits of reduced delays are widely recognised, it is less well understood how to best implement the tracing and notification protocol. The application will detect a multitude of contacts encountering an individual who later tests positive. Which of these contacts should be advised to self-isolate? The resolution hinges on an inherent trade-off: the more contacts notified, the greater the disease control, at the cost of more healthy individuals being instructed to self-isolate. In this study, based on a compartmental model tailored to the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a framework to incorporate testing with limited resources coupled with a mechanistic description of digital contact tracing. Specifically, we employ a family of distributions characterising contact exposure and infection risk, and introduce a notification threshold that controls which level of exposure triggers notification. We detail how contact tracing can prevent disease outbreak, as a function of adoption rate, testing limitations, and other intervention methods such as social distancing and lockdown measures. We find an optimal notification threshold that balances the trade-off by minimising the number of healthy individuals instructed to self-isolate while preventing disease outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davin Lunz","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Gregory Batt","author_inst":"Inria Paris"},{"author_name":"Jakob Ruess","author_inst":"Inria Paris"},{"author_name":"Melissa Oldham","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Jamie Brown","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lewis G.

Test positive rate, test per confirmed case, recovery rate, case fatality rate, and percent distribution of active cases were computed. Availability of hospitals, hospital beds, intensive care unit and ventilators per lakh population was also computed by public and private sector. The result revealed that, Maharashtra constitutes more than one-third positive cases in the country. More than a quarter of the active cases in India belonged to the Mumbai district of Maharashtra, followed by the Chennai district (9.4%) and Ahmedabad district (9.1%). Further, about 40 percent of the active cases in India belonged to the 11 districts of Maharashtra. The increased test positive rate in Maharashtra and Gujarat to almost double in last one month is a concern. In order to bring the states and the country in right track, the test positive rate need to be brought down to below 2 percent. The procurement of higher number of high throughput machine, the Cobas 6800 testing machine, is need of the hour. Only few states have adequate health infrastructure.

However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city. We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths. The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors). Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample. We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect. UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself. We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance. We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body. This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present. In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Margaret Skutsch","author_inst":"Centro de Investigaciones en Geografia Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Carlos Dobler","author_inst":"Centro de Investigaciones en Geografia Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Matthew B.B.

In this study a simple numerical model is used to illustrate the impact the timing of initial measures against Covid-19 has on the first wave of infection and possible implications this may have for the measures taken as the first wave is ebbing. The results highlight that delaying measures by 10 days is sufficient to largely account for the differences seen between countries such as the UK and Germany for the first wave of infections. A pronounced first wave means that a larger fraction of the total population will have been infected and is therefore likely to display immunity. Even if this fraction is far below the level needed for \"herd immunity\" the effective reproduction factor Re is decreased compared to a population that had no prior exposure to the virus. Even a small reduction in Re can have major influence on the evolution of the epidemic after the first wave of infections. A large first wave means the resulting value for Re will be lower than if the first wave was mild. Without either vaccine or effective treatment countries who experienced a small first wave should therefore relax measures at a slightly lower pace than countries where the first wave was strong.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joel Joel-Marie Hirschi","author_inst":"National Oceanography Centre"},{"author_name":"Carlos Dobler","author_inst":"Centro de Investigaciones en Geografia Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Matthew B.B.

We examined the characteristics of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in all affected counties of the United States. We proposed a COVID-Net combining the architecture of both Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by using the trajectories of COVID-19 during different periods until May 19, 2020, as the training data. The validation of the COVID-Net was performed by predicting the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in subsequent 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods. The COVID-Net produced relatively smaller Mean Relative Errors (MREs) for the 10 counties with the most severe epidemic as of May 19, 2020. On average, MREs were 0.01 for the number of confirmed cases in all validation periods, and 0.01, 0.01, and 0.03 for the number of deaths in the 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods, respectively. The COVID-Net incorporated five risk factors of COVID-19 and was used to predict the trajectories of COVID-19 in Hudson County, New Jersey and New York County, New York until June 28, 2020. The risk factors include the percentage of the population with access to exercise opportunities, average daily PM2.5, population size, preventable hospitalization rate, and violent crime rate. The expected number of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths depends on the dynamics of these five risk factors.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yuting Zhang","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhongfei Li","author_inst":"School of Management, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Fenner-Sanchez","author_inst":"CESMECA-UNICACH, Geobrujas-comunidad de geografas y Grupo Estepa UNAL"},{"author_name":"Felix Emmanuel Perez Talavera","author_inst":"Centro Medico Nacional Occidente"},{"author_name":"Freddy Jose Avila-Cervera","author_inst":"Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad de la Peninsula de Yucatan"},{"author_name":"Adriana Nohemi Velazquez Burciaga","author_inst":"Universidad Anahuac"},{"author_name":"Oscar Morado Aramburo","author_inst":"Hospital de la Beneficencia Espanola, San Luis Potosi."},{"author_name":"Luis Alberto Pina Olguin","author_inst":"Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad del Bajio"},{"author_name":"Adrian Soto-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Universidad del Valle de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Andres Castaneda Prado","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion en Politicas, Poblacion y Salud."},{"author_name":"Patricio Santillan-Doherty","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Juan O Galindo Galindo","author_inst":"Sistema de Salud Christus Muguerza"},{"author_name":"Daniel Hernandez Gordillo","author_inst":"Centro Medico Nacional Occidente"},{"author_name":"Juan Gutierrez Mejia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113514","rel_title":"Infoveillance to Analyze Covid19 Impact on Central America Population","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113514","rel_abs":"Infoveillance is an application within the Infodemiology field with the aim of monitoring public health and create public policies.

Methods: A deep-learning model (CAPE: Covid-19 AI Predictive Engine) was trained on 2337 CXR images including 2103 used only for validation while training. The prospective test set consisted of CXR images (n=70) obtained from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients between 1 January and 30 April 2020 in a single center. The radiographs were analyzed by the AI model. Model performance was obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: In the prospective test set, the mean age of the patients was 46 (+\/- 16.2) years (84.2% male). The deep-learning model accurately predicted outcomes of ICU admission\/mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.96).

To potentially expand the supply, we validated a rapidly applicable low-cost decontamination protocol in compliance with regulatory standards to enable the safe reuse of personalized, disposable N95-respirators. Methods: Four common models of N95-respirators were disinfected for 60 minutes at 70{degrees}C either at 0% or 50% relative humidity (RH). Effective inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and E. coli was evaluated in inoculated masks. The N95 filter integrity was examined with scanning electron microscopy. The protective function of disinfected N95 respirators was tested against US NIOSH standards for particle filtration efficiency, breathing resistance and respirator fit. Results: A single heat treatment inactivated both SARS-CoV-2 (undetectable, detection limit: 100 TCID50\/ml) and E. coli (0 colonies at 50%RH) in all four respirator models. Even N95-respirators that underwent ten decontamination cycles maintained their integrity and met US governmental criteria for approval regarding fit, filtration efficiency and breathing resistance. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated maintained N95 fiber diameter compared to baseline. Interpretation: Thermal disinfection enables large-scale, low-cost decontamination of existing N95-respirators using commonly sourced equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This process could be used in hospitals and long term care facilities and also provides a feasible approach to expand the N95 supply in low- and middle-income regions.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simeon C.

To evaluate the COVID-19 incidence among migrants from different areas of the world as compared to Spaniards living in Alcorcon Design. Population-based cohort analysis of the cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases until April 25 (2020) among adult residents at Alcorcon (Spain) attended at the only public hospital serving this city. Crude incident rates for Spaniards and migrants from different areas of the world were estimated. Age and sex-adjusted relative risks for COVID19 were estimated by negative polynomial regression. Setting. University public Hospital at Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain Participants. All adult residents living in Alcorcon classified by their country and region of the world of origin. Main outcome. PCR confirmed COVID-19. Results. PCR confirmed COVID-19 cumulative incidence was 6.81 cases per 1000 inhabitants among residents of Alcorcon. The crude incidence among migrants (n=20419) was higher than among Spaniards (n=131599): 8.81 and 6.51 and per 1000 inhabitants respectively (p<0.001). By regions of the world, crude cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates were: European Union 2.38 , Asia 2.01, , Northern Africa 3.59, East ern Europe 4.37, Sub-Saharan Africa 11.24, Caribbean 18.26 and Latin-America 20.77 8 per 1000 inhabitants. Migrant residents were markedly younger than Spaniards (median age 52 vs 73 years, p<0.001). By negative polynomial logistic regression, adjusted for age and sex, relative risks (RR) for COVID-19 were not significantly different from Spaniards for individuals from Europe, Asia or Northern Africa. In contrast, there was an increased risk for Sub-Saharan Africa (RR 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-9.41, p=0.007), Caribbean (RR 6.35, 95% CI 3.83-10.55, p<0.001) and Latin-America (RR 6.92, 95% CI 4.49-10.67, p <0.001). Interpretation. There was a marked increased risk for COVID-19 among migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean and Latin-America residing in Spain. The reasons underlying this increased risk and health and social implications deserve further attention.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Guijarro","author_inst":"HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO FUNDACION ALCORCON.

Methods: We reported our meta-analysis according to the Cochrane Handbook. We searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and clinical trial registries for eligible studies published between 1 January and 25 April 2020. The number of positive tests and total number of conducted tests were collected as raw data. The proportion of positive tests in the pooled data were calculated by score confidence interval estimation with the Freeman-Tukey transformation. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 measure and the Chi2 test. Results: The systematic search revealed 96 records after removal of duplicates. 26 records were included for qualitative analysis and 5 records for quantitative synthesis. We found 91% (95%CI = 80%-99%) sensitivity for saliva tests and 98% (95%CI 89%-100%) sensitivity for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) tests in previously confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, with moderate heterogeneity among studies. Additionally, we identified 18 registered, ongoing clinical trials on saliva-based tests for detection of the virus.

Unmasking the state-wise variation in the effect of the nationwide lockdown on the progression of the pandemic could inform dynamic policy interventions towards containment and mitigation. Methods Using data on confirmed COVID-19 cases across 20 states that accounted for more than 99% of the cumulative case counts in India till May 31, 2020, we illustrate the masking of state-level trends and highlight the variations across states by presenting evaluative evidence on some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: case-fatality rates, doubling times of cases, effective reproduction numbers, and the scale of testing. Results The estimated effective reproduction number R for India was 3.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): [3.03, 3.71]) on March 24, whereas the average of estimates from May 25 - May 31 stands at 1.27 (95% CI: [1.26, 1.28]). Similarly, the estimated doubling time across India was at 3.56 days on March 24, and the past 7-day average for the same on May 31 is 14.37 days. The average daily number of tests have increased from 1,717 (March 19-25) to 131,772 (May 25-31) with an estimated testing shortfall of 4.58 million tests nationally by May 31. However, various states exhibit substantial departures from these national patterns. Conclusions Patterns of change over lockdown periods indicate the lockdown has been effective in slowing the spread of the virus nationally. The COVID-19 outbreak in India displays large state-level variations and identifying these variations can help in both understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and formulating effective public health interventions. Our framework offers a holistic assessment of the pandemic across Indian states and union territories along with a set of interactive visualization tools that are daily updated at covind19.org.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Deepankar Basu","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Debashree Ray","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinsasser","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Soumik Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szakacs","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Peter Hegyi","author_inst":"University of Pecs Medical School"},{"author_name":"Martin C.

Such general population control measures could significantly influence perception, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Here, we assessed KAP towards COVID-19 immediately after the lock-down measures were implemented and during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. Online-based cross-sectional study conducted from March 29 to April 19, 2020, involving Bangladeshi residents aged 12-64 years, recruited via social media. After consenting, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables, perception, and KAP towards COVID-19. Of the 2017 survey participants, 59.8% were male, the majority were students (71.2%), aged 21-30 years (57.9%), having a bachelor's degree (61.0%), having family income >30,000 BDT (50.0%), and living in urban areas (69.8). The survey revealed that 48.3% of participants had more accurate knowledge, 62.3% had more positive attitudes, and 55.1% had more frequent practices regarding COVID-19 prevention. Majority (96.7%) of the participants agreed COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, almost all (98.7%) participants wore a face mask in crowded places, 98.8% agreed to report a suspected case to health authorities, and 93.8% implemented washing hands with soap and water. In multiple logistic regression analyses, COVID-19 more accurate knowledge was associated with age and residence. Sociodemographic factors such as being older, higher education, employment, monthly family income >30,000 BDT, and having more frequent prevention practices were the more positive attitude factors. More frequent prevention practice factors were associated with female sex, older age, higher education, family income > 30,000 BDT, urban area residence, and having more positive attitudes. To improve KAP of general populations is crucial during the rapid rise period of a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19. Therefore, development of effective health education programs that incorporate considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Most.

While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis,5 these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Goldman-Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eric Song","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Mao","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amit Meir","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mia Madel Alfajaro","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Wei","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Huiping Dong","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Homer","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aaron Ring","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leo L.M.

The test measures the capacity of serum or purified antibodies to neutralize a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. This recombinant virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT) induces fusion in Vero cell monolayers, which is detected as luciferase signal using a dual split protein (DSP) reporter system. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT infection was blocked by monoclonal -SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of -SARS-CoV-2-spike monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IMMUNO-COV assay accurately quantitates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in human sera and therefore is a potentially valuable addition to the currently available serological tests. The assay can provide vital information for comparing immune responses to the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, or for evaluating donor eligibility in convalescent plasma therapy studies.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rianna Vandergaast","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Timothy Carey","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Samantha Reiter","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Patrycja Lech","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Clement Gnanadurai","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mulu Tesfay","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jason Buehler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukkana Suksanpaisan","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shruthi Naik","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Bethany Brunton","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jordan Recker","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Michelle Haselton","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Christopher Ziegler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anne Roesler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"John R.

The study of differentially expressed genes in case-control cohorts of patients is often the first step in understanding the details of the cells dysregulation. A further level of analysis is introduced by noticing that genes are organized in functional modules (often called pathways), thus their action and their dysregulation may be better understood by the identification of the modules most affected by the disease (aka disease modules, or active subnetworks). We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method developed originally for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks, can be adapted to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the easier general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge of 2019. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover for the two cancer data sets, Core&Peel detects further nine relevant pathways enriched in the predicted disease module, not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally we apply Core&Peel, along with other methods, to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, at a modular level, aiming at finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Lucchetta","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Marco Pellegrini","author_inst":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche"},{"author_name":"Samantha Reiter","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Patrycja Lech","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Clement Gnanadurai","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mulu Tesfay","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jason Buehler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukkana Suksanpaisan","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shruthi Naik","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Bethany Brunton","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jordan Recker","author_inst":"Vyriad, Inc."},{"author_name":"Michelle Haselton","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Christopher Ziegler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anne Roesler","author_inst":"Imanis Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"John R.

Additionally, no antiviral drugs or vaccines were developed against the closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, despite previous zoonotic outbreaks. To identify starting points for such therapeutics, we performed a large-scale screen of electrophile and non-covalent fragments through a combined mass spectrometry and X-ray approach against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, one of two cysteine viral proteases essential for viral replication. Our crystallographic screen identified 71 hits that span the entire active site, as well as 3 hits at the dimer interface. These structures reveal routes to rapidly develop more potent inhibitors through merging of covalent and non-covalent fragment hits; one series of low-reactivity, tractable covalent fragments was progressed to discover improved binders. These combined hits offer unprecedented structural and reactivity information for on-going structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice Douangamath","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd."},{"author_name":"Daren Fearon","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd."},{"author_name":"Paul Gehrtz","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tobias Krojer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Petra Lukacik","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd."},{"author_name":"C.

Unfortunately, traditional drug discovery methods have a >90% failure rate and can take 10-15 years from target identification to clinical use. In contrast, drug repurposing can significantly accelerate translation. We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious single agents and combination therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Quantitative high-content morphological profiling was coupled with an AI-based machine learning strategy to classify features of cells for infection and stress. This assay detected multiple antiviral mechanisms of action (MOA), including inhibition of viral entry, propagation, and modulation of host cellular responses. From a library of 1,425 FDA-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 16 dose-responsive compounds with antiviral effects. In particular, we discovered that lactoferrin is an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection with an IC50 of 308 nM and that it potentiates the efficacy of both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Lactoferrin also stimulates an antiviral host cell response and retains inhibitory activity in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cells, a model for the primary site of infection. Given its safety profile in humans, these data suggest that lactoferrin is a readily translatable therapeutic adjunct for COVID-19. Additionally, several commonly prescribed drugs were found to exacerbate viral infection and warrant clinical investigation. We conclude that morphological profiling for drug repurposing is an effective strategy for the selection and optimization of drugs and drug combinations as viable therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carmen Mirabelli","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Jesse W.

Although the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is about 1 % of the global population and RA patients naturally have a chance of acquiring COVID-19 in this pandemic, no studies have considered the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (a receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in synovial tissues.

Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS\/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9\/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to \"common cold\" human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.\n\nThus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina Le Bert","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anthony Tanoto Tan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Kamini Kunasegaran","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christine Y.
