The enhanced levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) and preventative measures to attenuate viral transmission during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are having a huge impact on healthcare provision. There is no quantitative evidence on the number and size of airborne particles produced during AGPs to inform risk assessments. Methods Real-time, high-resolution environmental monitoring was conducted in ultraclean ventilation operating theatres. Continuous sampling with an optical particle sizer allowed characterization of aerosol generation within the airway management zone during endotracheal intubation and extubation for urgent orthopaedic trauma or neuro-surgery. Results Aerosol monitoring showed a very low background particle count allowing resolution of the transient airborne particle plume produced by reference volitional coughs (maximum concentration, 1,690{+\/-}140 particles.L 1,n=38). By comparison, endotracheal intubation including mask ventilation produced negligible quantities of aerosolized particles (maximum concentration, 80{+\/-}10 L 1,n=14, P<0.001 vs cough). Extubation, particularly when the patient coughed, produced a detectable aerosol plume but with a smaller number of particles (<25%) than a volitional cough. Conclusions Using a volitional cough as a reference we have been able to produce a relative risk ranking for endotracheal intubation and extubation as potential AGPs. The study does not support the assignation of endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy with manual ventilation as an AGP. Extubation does generate aerosols, particularly if the patient coughs, but these are weaker than a standard reference. These findings indicate the need for a reappraisal of guidance on PPE for AGPs.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jules Brown","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol,  BS10 5NB"},{"author_name":"Florence KA Gregson","author_inst":"School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, BS8 1TS."},{"author_name":"Andrew Shrimpton","author_inst":"School of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neuroscience, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TD"},{"author_name":"Bryan R Bzdek","author_inst":"School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TS"},{"author_name":"Anthony E Pickering","author_inst":"School of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Bristol, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Reid","author_inst":"School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TS."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"anesthesia"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20182071","rel_title":"Efficacy of Localized Lockdowns in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20182071","rel_abs":"Six months into the pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing, lockdowns) are the only available measure to control severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Around the world, policymakers have implemented localized lockdowns in small geographic areas to prevent the spread of the disease. As governments ease restrictions, localized lockdowns are becoming a relevant policy option in cases of resurgence, as they can, in principle, reduce social and economic costs compared to larger-scale SARS-CoV-2 suppression strategies. The effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been typically described using mathematical models; however, there is a lack of empirical evidence of their causal effects to inform health policy. Using an integrated dataset from Chile, we estimated the direct and indirect (spillover) causal effects of localized lockdowns on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that the effectiveness of localized lockdowns is strongly modulated by duration and is affected by spillover effects from neighboring geographic areas. Our projections suggest that extending localized lockdowns will slow down the epidemic. However, by themselves, localized lockdowns will be unable to control epidemic growth due to spillovers from neighboring areas with high interdependencies, unless those contiguous areas also implement lockdowns.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yige Li","author_inst":"Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eduardo A Undurraga","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Millennium Initiative for Collaborative Research in Bacterial Resistance MICROB-R"},{"author_name":"Jose Ramon Zubizarreta","author_inst":"Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health; Department of Statistics, Harvard Facult"},{"author_name":"Bryan R Bzdek","author_inst":"School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TS"},{"author_name":"Anthony E Pickering","author_inst":"School of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neuroscience, Bristol, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Reid","author_inst":"School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TS."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20182105","rel_title":"DNA Methylation Architecture of the ACE2 gene in Nasal Cells","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20182105","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

In the absence of any vaccine, the prediction of the confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases is required to enhance the health care system's capacity and control the transmission. In this study, the cumulative and the daily confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases in Uttar Pradesh, India, were analyzed.

We assessed the risk of measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya as a case study for the African Region. Methods: Combining measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage into a cohort model, we predicted the age-adjusted population immunity in Kenya and estimated the probability of outbreaks when contact-reducing COVID-19 interventions are lifted. We considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020. Findings: In February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the herd immunity threshold and the probability for one case to initiate a large outbreak as 22% (0-46). As restrictions to physical contact are lifted, from December 2020, the probability for a large outbreak increased to 31% (8-51), 35% (16-52) and 43% (31-56) assuming a 15%, 50% and 100% reduction in vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk is higher at 37% (17-54), 44% (29-57) and 57% (48-65) for the same coverage scenarios respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of the COVID-19 restrictions on contact can be overcome by conducting an SIA with [&ge;] 95% coverage in under-fives. Interpretation: While the reduction in measles transmissibility through COVID-19 restrictions temporarily reduced the risk from a measles immunity gap, this risk rises again rapidly once physical distancing is relaxed. Implementing delayed SIAs will be critical for prevention of measles outbreaks once contact restrictions are fully lifted in Kenya.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caroline Ngendo Mburu","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"John Ojal","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya & London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rose Chebet","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Donald Akech","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Boniface Karia","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"James Tuju","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Antipa Sigilai","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Kaja Abbas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gaby Smits","author_inst":"National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Pieter G.M van Gageldonk","author_inst":"National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Fiona R.M van der Klis","author_inst":"National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Collins Tabu","author_inst":"National Vaccine and Immunisation Programme, Ministry of Health, Kenya"},{"author_name":"D James Nokes","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya & School of Life Sciences and Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Re"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Anthony Scott","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi Kenya & London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ifedayo M.

Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing mental health symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N=895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of mental health disorders (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. Outcomes: A clinically significant level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were reported by 26.2% (N=235), 22.4% (N=201), and 17.3% (N=155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with clinically significant level of depressive (aOR=1.059;95%CI=1.002-1.119), anxiety (aOR=1.072;95%CI=1.012-1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aOR=1.092;95%CI=1.024-1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. Interpretation: Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may predispose individuals to depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms after the acute phase of the disease. These patients should be monitored for the development of mental health disorders after COVID-19 treatment discharge. Early interventions, such as brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies, could benefit these individuals.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavia Ismael","author_inst":"Universidade Municipal de Sao Caetano do Sul, Sao Caetano do Sul, SP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Joao C.

This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in spreading the infection in indoor environments. Methods: We modelled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the Vatican State childrens hospital Bambino Gesu. Both waiting rooms and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patients mouth was also assessed. Results: Our CFD-based simulations show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhance infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 seconds from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. In the waiting room simulation, Infection-Index parameter increases the faster the higher the HVAC airflow. Greater flows of air conditioning correspond to greater diffusion of the infected droplets. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient s mouth in the first 0.5 seconds following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. Conclusions: CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals\/ambulatories and in other public\/private settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Borro","author_inst":"Department of Imaging, Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Unit, Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mazzei","author_inst":"Ergon Research, CFD Consultant, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Raponi","author_inst":"Hospital Directorate, Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Prisco Piscitelli","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy; - Staff UNESCO Chair on Health Education and Sustainable Development, Federico II University, Nap"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine - Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy, University of Milan, Milan, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Aurelio Secinaro","author_inst":"Department of Imaging, Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Unit, Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Ventriglio","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Megan E.

Methods: Using a mathematical model, we identified contact mitigation strategies that minimised COVID-19-related deaths or years of life lost (YLLs) over a time-horizon of 15 months, using an intervention lasting six or 12 months, in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK. We used strategies that either altered age- or location-specific contact patterns. The optimisation was performed under the constraint that herd immunity should be achieved by the end of the intervention period if post-infection immunity was persistent. We then tested the effect of waning immunity on the strategies. Findings: Strategies of contact mitigation by age were much more effective than those based on mitigation by location. Extremely stringent contact reductions for individuals aged over 50 were required in most countries to minimise deaths or YLLs. The median final proportion of the population ever-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after herd immunity was reached ranged between 30% and 43%, depending on the country and intervention duration. Compared to an unmitigated scenario, optimised age-specific mitigation was predicted to avert over 1 million deaths across the six countries. The optimised scenarios assuming persistent immunity resulted in comparable hospital occupancies to that experienced during the March-April European wave. However, if immunity was short-lived, high burdens were expected without permanent contact mitigation. Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that age-selective mitigation strategies can reduce the mortality impacts of COVID-19 dramatically even when significant transmission occurs. The stringency of the required restrictions in some groups raises concerns about the practicality of these strategies. If post-infection immunity was short-lived, solutions based on a mitigation period designed to increase population immunity should be accompanied with ongoing contact mitigation to prevent large epidemic resurgence.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Romain Ragonnet","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Briffoteaux","author_inst":"University of Mons, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Bridget M Williams","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Julian Savulescu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Segal","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Milinda Abayawardana","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Tuyttens","author_inst":"University of Mons, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Nouredine Melab","author_inst":"Universite de Lille, CNRS CRIStAL, Inria Lille, France"},{"author_name":"Ben J Marais","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Emma S McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"James M Trauer","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Fiona R.M van der Klis","author_inst":"National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Collins Tabu","author_inst":"National Vaccine and Immunisation Programme, Ministry of Health, Kenya"},{"author_name":"D James Nokes","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya & School of Life Sciences and Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Re"},{"author_name":"- LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"John Anthony Scott","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi Kenya & London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ifedayo M.

This model would require binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells via cell surface co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the putative receptor and effector protease, respectively. To define ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the human pancreas, we examined six transcriptional datasets from primary human islet cells and assessed protein expression by immunofluorescence in pancreata from donors with and without diabetes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts were low or undetectable in pancreatic islet endocrine cells as determined by bulk or single cell RNA sequencing, and neither protein was detected in  or {beta} cells from any of these donors. Instead, ACE2 protein was expressed in the islet and exocrine tissue microvasculature and also found in a subset of pancreatic ducts, whereas TMPRSS2 protein was restricted to ductal cells. The absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in islet endocrine cells makes it unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 directly affects pancreatic islet {beta} cells.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katie C Coate","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"JeeYeon Cha","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shristi Shrestha","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Wenliang Wang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Fasolino","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Morgan","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chunhua Dai","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Diane C Saunders","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Radhika Aramandla","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Regina Jenkins","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Meghan E Kapp","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roland Stein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Klaus H Kaestner","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Golnaz Vahedi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marcela Brissova","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alvin C Powers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Anthony Scott","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi Kenya & London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ifedayo M.

SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are responsible for viral polyprotein cleavage - a process crucial for viral survival and replication. Recently it was shown that 2-phenylbenzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (ebselen), an organoselenium anti-inflammatory small-molecule drug, is a potent, covalent inhibitor of both the proteases and its potency was evaluated in enzymatic and anti-viral assays. In this study, we screened a collection of 23 ebselen derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro inhibitors. Our studies revealed that ebselen derivatives are potent inhibitors of both the proteases. We identified three PLpro and four Mpro inhibitors superior to ebselen. Our work shows that ebselen constitutes a promising platform for development of new antiviral agents targeting both SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mikolaj Zmudzinski","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wioletta Rut","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kamila Olech","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Granda","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Miroslaw Giurg","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Malgorzata Burda-Grabowska","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Linlin Zhang","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Xinyuanyuan Sun","author_inst":"University of Lubeck"},{"author_name":"Zongyang Lv","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry & Structural Biology University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Digant Nayak","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry & Structural Biology University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Malgorzata Kesik-Brodacka","author_inst":"Research Network Lukasiewicz - Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics"},{"author_name":"Shaun Olsen","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry & Structural Biology University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Rolf Hilgenfeld","author_inst":"University of Lubeck"},{"author_name":"Marcin Drag","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Marcela Brissova","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alvin C Powers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Anthony Scott","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi Kenya & London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ifedayo M.

Specifically, we analyzed five public scRNAseq pancreas datasets and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunolocalization for ACE2 with extensive reagent validation on normal human pancreatic tissues across the lifespan, as well as those from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These in silico and ex vivo analyses demonstrated pancreatic expression of ACE2 is prominent in pancreatic ductal epithelium and the microvasculature, with rare endocrine cell expression of this molecule. Pancreata from COVID-19 patients demonstrated multiple thrombotic lesions with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein expression primarily limited to ducts.

Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.","rel_num_authors":52,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rolle Rahikainen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anthony Keeble","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Saira Hussain","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ruth Harvey","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Jack Hayes","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Jane Edwards","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca McLean","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Veronica Martini","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Miriam Pedrera","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Nazia Thakur","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Carina Conceicao","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Dietrich","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Holly Shelton","author_inst":"The Pirbright institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Barbara Ludi","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"G Wilsden","author_inst":"The pirbright institute"},{"author_name":"Clare Browning","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrian Zagrajek","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Dagmara Bialy","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Sushant Bhat","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Phoebe Stevenson-Leggett","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Philippa Hollinghurst","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Tully","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Katy Moffat","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Chris Chiu","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Ryan Waters","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Ashley Gray","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Mehreen Azhar","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Mioulet","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Joseph Newman","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin S Asfor","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Alison Burman","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Crossley","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"John Hammond","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Elma Tchilian","author_inst":"Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Bryan Charleston","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Dalan Bailey","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Tobias J Tuthill","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Simon Graham","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Huo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ray Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rod Daniels","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.273441","rel_title":"Methylene Blue Inhibits In Vitro the SARS-CoV-2 Spike - ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction - A Mechanism That Can Contribute to Its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.273441","rel_abs":"Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 M) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction with an activity similar, possibly slightly higher, than those found for it for other PPIs. This PPI inhibitory activity of methylene blue could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Damir Bojadzic","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Oscar Alcazar","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Peter Buchwald","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Anthony Keeble","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Schimanski","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Saira Hussain","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ruth Harvey","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Jack Hayes","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Jane Edwards","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Rebecca McLean","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Veronica Martini","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Miriam Pedrera","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Nazia Thakur","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Carina Conceicao","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Dietrich","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Holly Shelton","author_inst":"The Pirbright institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Barbara Ludi","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"G Wilsden","author_inst":"The pirbright institute"},{"author_name":"Clare Browning","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrian Zagrajek","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Dagmara Bialy","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Sushant Bhat","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Phoebe Stevenson-Leggett","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Philippa Hollinghurst","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Tully","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Katy Moffat","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Chris Chiu","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Ryan Waters","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Ashley Gray","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Mehreen Azhar","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Mioulet","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Joseph Newman","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin S Asfor","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Alison Burman","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Crossley","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"John Hammond","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Elma Tchilian","author_inst":"Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Bryan Charleston","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Dalan Bailey","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Tobias J Tuthill","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Simon Graham","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Huo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ray Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rod Daniels","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Mark Howarth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"pharmacology and toxicology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180737","rel_title":"Real-time Nowcasting and Forecasting of COVID-19 Dynamics in England: the first wave?","rel_date":"2020-08-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180737","rel_abs":"England has been heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with severe 'lock-down' mitigation measures now gradually being lifted.

This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01\/01\/2020-26\/06\/2020. Methods Systematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. Results 150 papers were included. Most studies (75%) were observational in design, and included papers were generally of moderate quality based on hospitalised patients. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, and up to around 3 months from disease onset, although inconsistencies remain concerning clinical correlates. Development of neutralising antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is typical, although titres may be low. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross reactivity but limited cross neutralisation occurs with other HCoVs. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo is limited to small, short-term animal studies, which show promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase. Interpretation Published literature on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity with regard to methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Antibody dynamics have been evaluated thoroughly in the acute phase but longer follow up and a comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity is needed. The role of protective neutralising antibodies is emerging, with implications for therapeutics and vaccines. Large, cross-national cohort studies using appropriate statistical analysis and standardised serological assays and clinical classifications should be prioritised.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathan Post","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Danielle Eddy","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Catherine Huntley","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"May C.

The treatments and vaccines rely on the basic biophysics of the complex viral apparatus. While proteins are serving as main drug and vaccine targets, therapeutic approaches targeting the 30,000 nucleotide RNA viral genome form important complementary approaches. Indeed, the high conservation of the viral genome, its close evolutionary relationship to other viruses, and the rise of gene editing and RNA-based vaccines all argue for a focus on the RNA agent itself. One of the key steps in the viral replication cycle inside host cells is the ribosomal frameshifting required for translation of overlapping open reading frames. The frameshifting element (FSE), one of three highly conserved regions of coronaviruses, includes an RNA pseudoknot considered essential for this ribosomal switching. In this work, we apply our graph-theory-based framework for representing RNA secondary structures, \"RAG\" (RNA-As Graphs), to alter key structural features of the FSE of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, using RAG machinery of genetic algorithms for inverse folding adapted for RNA structures with pseudoknots, we computationally predict minimal mutations that destroy a structurally-important stem and\/or the pseudoknot of the FSE, potentially dismantling the virus against translation of the polyproteins. Additionally, our microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of mutant structures indicate relatively stable secondary structures. These findings not only advance our computational design of RNAs containing pseudoknots; they pinpoint to key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing approaches.\n\nSIGNIFICANCESince the outbreak of Covid-19, numerous projects were launched to discover drugs and vaccines. Compared to protein-focused approaches, targeting the RNA genome, especially highly conserved crucial regions, can destruct the virus life cycle more fundamentally and avoid problems of viral mutations. We choose to target the small frame-shifting element (FSE) embedded in the Open Reading Frame 1a,b of SARS-CoV-2. This FSE is essential for translating overlapping reading frames and thus controlling the viral protein synthesis pathway. By applying graph-theory-based computational algorithms, we identify structurally crucial residues in the FSE as potential targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tamar Schlick","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Qiyao Zhu","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Swati Jain","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Shuting Yan","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Madhumita Shrotri","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Leeman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Samuel Rigby","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarah V.

Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1-5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6-8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to \"up\" RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both \"up\" and \"down\" RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize \"up\" and \"down\" RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only \"up\" RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent \"down\" RBDs, thereby locking spike into a closed conformation. Epitope\/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher O Barnes","author_inst":"California Institute of

Although considered primarily a respiratory infection, many COVID-19 patients also suffer severe cardiovascular disease2-4. Improving patient care critically relies on understanding if cardiovascular pathology is caused directly by viral infection of cardiac cells or indirectly via systemic inflammation and\/or coagulation abnormalities3,5-9. Here we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We observe that hPSC-CMs express the viral receptor ACE2 and other viral processing factors, and that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects and replicates within hPSC-CMs, resulting in rapid cell death. Moreover, infected hPSC-CMs show a progressive impairment in both electrophysiological and contractile properties. Thus, COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms likely result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2. Long-term cardiac complications might be possible sequelae in patients who recover from this illness.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Marchiano","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Tien-Ying Hsiang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ty Higashi","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Akshita Kanna","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hans Reinecke","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xiulan Yang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lil Pabon","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nathan J Sniadecki","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bertero","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Charles E Murry","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Anthony P West","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Bjorkman","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tong Jin","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chengmin Shi","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Du","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yadong Zhang","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chuandong Liu","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rujiao Li","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jingyao Zeng","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lili Hao","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shuai Jiang","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hua Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics (China National Center for Bioinformation)"},{"author_name":"Dali Han","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jingfa Xiao","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhang Zhang","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenming Zhao","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yongbiao Xue","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yiming Bao","author_inst":"China National Center for Bioinformation \/ Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Valerie Mioulet","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Joseph Newman","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin S Asfor","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Alison Burman","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Crossley","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"John Hammond","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Elma Tchilian","author_inst":"Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Bryan Charleston","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Dalan Bailey","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Tobias J Tuthill","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Simon Graham","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Huo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ray Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rod Daniels","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"John McCauley","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital;

Bonn, Germany","rel_date":"2020-08-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20181206","rel_abs":"Background Accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence are crucial for the implementation of effective public health measures, but are currently largely lacking in regions with low infection rates. This is further complicated by inadequate test performance of many widely used serological assays. We therefore aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a region with low COVID-19 burden, especially focusing on neutralizing antibodies that presumably constitute a major component of acquired immunity. Methods We invited all individuals who were enrolled in the Rhineland Study, an ongoing community-based prospective cohort study in people aged 30 years and above in the city of Bonn, Germany (N=5427). Between April 24th and June 30th, 2020, 4771 (88%) of these individuals participated in the serosurvey. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured using an ELISA assay, and all positive or borderline results were subsequently examined through both a recombinant immunofluorescent assay and a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT). Findings Seroprevalence was 0.97% (95% CI: 0.72-1.30) by ELISA and 0.36% (95% CI: 0.21-0.61) by PRNT, and did not vary with either age or sex. All PRNT+ individuals reported having experienced at least one symptom (odds ratio (OR) of PRNT+ for each additional symptom: 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04-1.21)). Apart from living in a household with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed or suspected person, a recent history of reduced taste or smell, fever, chills\/hot flashes, pain while breathing, pain in arms\/legs, as well as muscle pain and weakness were significantly associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies in those with mild to moderate infection (ORs 3.44 to 9.97, all p<0.018). Interpretation Our findings indicate a relatively low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Bonn, Germany (until June 30th, 2020), with neutralizing antibodies detectable in only one third of those with a positive immunoassay result, implying that almost the entire population in this region remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"N.

This systematic review critically evaluates and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published in recent months. Methods For this systematic review, independent keyword-structured literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer for studies published from 01\/01\/2020-26\/06\/2020. Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. Results 61 articles were included. Almost all studies used observational designs, were hospital-based, and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity, duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virus-specific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility, respectively, remains unclear. Interpretation A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the cellular response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madhumita Shrotri","author_inst":"London School of

prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, especially in those who are critically ill. Available studies report varying prevalence rates. Hence, the exact prevalence remains uncertain. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding the appropriate dosage of thromboprophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies exploring the prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients till 22\/07\/2020. We pooled the proportion of VTE. Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, we pooled VTE events detected by systematic screening. Finally, we compared the odds of VTE in patients on prophylactic compared to therapeutic anticoagulation. Results: The review comprised of 24 studies and over 2500 patients. The pooled proportion of VTE prevalence was 0.31 (95% CI 0.24, 0.39 I2 94%), of VTE utilizing systematic screening was 0.48 (95% CI 0.33, 0.63 I2 91%), of deep-venous-thrombosis was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14, 0.32 I2 96%), of pulmonary embolism was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09, 0.20 I2 90%). In a subgroup of studies, utilizing systematic screening, VTE risk increased significantly with prophylactic, compared to therapeutic anticoagulation (OR 5.45; 95% CI 1.90, 15.57 I2 0%). Discussion: Our review revealed a high prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Almost 50% of patients had VTE detected by systematic screening. Higher thromboprophylaxis dosages seem to reduce VTE burden in this patient's cohort compared to standard prophylactic anticoagulation; ongoing randomized controlled trials will further confirm this.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mouhand F.H.

Methods: A social network campaign on Instagram was raised to approach the target population. The dental students responded to a multiple-response question asking where they get information about COVID-19. The possible answers were government official websites or health and education institutions websites, TV Programs, professors, social media, scientific articles, other health professionals, and family members. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of responses were evaluated by gender, age, type of institution, and year of enrollment. Results: A total of 833 valid responses were received. The main source of information used by the dental students were government official websites or health and education institutions websites (88.7%), other health professionals (57.3%), and scientific articles (56.2%). The use of social media was reported by 54.1% of the students, while TV programs were information sources used by 39.9% of the students. The least used information sources were professors (38.1%) and family members (7.8%). Conclusions: The respondents seem to be acquainted to seek information in reliable sources and also use social media as a gateway to keep updated about the pandemics. Therefore, knowing where the dental students seek information about COVID-19 might facilitate dental school directors to approach such public continuously, providing them with trustable information on different platforms.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Gerusa Brito Aragao","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Francisco Isaac Fernandes Gomes","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Camila Siqueira Silva Coelho","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Leticia Pinho Maia Paixao de Melo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Silmara Aparecida Milori Corona","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Shahd I.

The website combines documented case reports at the county level with ascertainment bias information obtained via population-wide serological surveys to estimate real time circulating, per-capita infection rates. These rates are updated daily as a means to visualize the risk associated with gatherings, including county maps and state-level plots. The website provides data-driven information to help individuals and policy-makers make prudent decisions (e.g., increasing mask wearing compliance and avoiding larger gatherings) that could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in hard-hit regions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aroon Chande","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology & the Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Seolha Lee","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Mallory Harris","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Troy Hilley","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Clio Andris","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hazem Elewa","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Khalid M.

We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus assays. By democratizing the testing of 3CL inhibitors to enable screening in the majority of laboratories rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure, we hope to expedite the search for

It is a hypothetical gene, which was speculated to encode a 38 aa protein. This hypothetical protein does not share sequence similarity with any other known protein and cannot be associated with a function. While the role of this ORF10 was proposed, there is a growing evidence showing that the ORF10 is not a coding region.\n\nHere, we identified SARS-CoV-2 variants in which the ORF10 gene was prematurely terminated. The disease was not attenuated, and the transmissibility between humans was not hampered. Also in vitro, the strains replicated similarly, as the related viruses with the intact ORF10. Altogether, based on clinical observation and laboratory analyses, it appears that the ORF10 protein is not essential in humans. This observation further proves that the ORF10 should not be treated as the protein-coding gene, and the genome annotations should be amended.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katarzyna Pancer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene, Chocimska 24, 00-791 Warsaw, Poland."},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Milewska","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology; Jagiellonian University; ul.

The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G. Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3) activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC). With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ethan Tietze","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Andre Rocha Barbosa","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Veronica Euclydes","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Hyeon Jin Cho","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Yong Kyu Lee","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Arthur Feltrin","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Joyce van de Leemput","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Pasquale Di Carlo","author_inst":"Lieber Institute"},{"author_name":"Tomoyo Sawada","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Kynon J.

To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover, as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nadezhda V Antipova","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Tatyana D Larionova","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Michail I Shakhparonov","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Marat S Pavlyukov","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Yong Kyu Lee","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Arthur Feltrin","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Joyce van de Leemput","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Pasquale Di Carlo","author_inst":"Lieber Institute"},{"author_name":"Tomoyo Sawada","author_inst":"Lieber Institute for Brain Development"},{"author_name":"Kynon J.
