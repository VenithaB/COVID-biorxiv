Currently, since there are not effective antiviral treat- ments for Covid-19 yet, it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease, thus helping to reduce mortality. While a corresponding vaccine is being developed, and different measures are being used to combat the virus, medical imaging techniques have also been investigated to assist doctors in diag- nosing this disease. Objective: This paper presents a practical solution for the detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images, exploiting cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. Methods: We employ EfficientNet and MixNet, two recently developed families of deep neural networks, as the main classifica- tion engine. Furthermore, we also apply different transfer learning strategies, aiming at making the training process more accurate and efficient. The proposed approach has been validated by means of two real datasets, the former consists of 13,511 training images and 1,489 testing images, the latter has 14,324 and 3,581 images for training and testing, respectively. Results: The results are promising: by all the experimental configurations considered in the evaluation,our approach always yields an accuracy larger than 95.0%, with the maximum accuracy obtained being 96.64%. Conclusions: As a comparison with various existing studies, we can thus conclude that our performance improvement is significant.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phuong Nguyen","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Ludovico Iovino","author_inst":"Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Flammini","author_inst":"Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy"},{"author_name":"Linh Tuan Linh","author_inst":"Duy Tan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20172551","rel_title":"Results and Impact of Intensive SARS-CoV-2 Testing in a High Volume, Outpatient Radiation Oncology Clinic in a Pandemic Hotspot","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20172551","rel_abs":"Background: In an attempt to reduce interruptions in radiation treatment, our department implemented universal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing during the peak of the New York City COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Starting 4\/18\/20, outpatients coming into the Department of Radiation Oncology for either simulation or brachytherapy were required to undergo PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Starting on 5\/6\/20, patients were offered simultaneous SARS CoV-2 IgG antibody testing. Results: Between 4\/18\/20-6\/25\/20, 1360 patients underwent 1,401 outpatient screening visits (Table 1). Of the patients screened, 411 were screened between 4\/18\/20 and 5\/6\/20 (Phase 1) with PCR testing: 13 (3.1%) patients were PCR positive. From 5\/7\/20 to 6\/25\/20, 990 patients were scheduled for both PCR and antibody testing (Phase 2), including 41 previously screened in Phase 1. Of those with known antibody status (n=952), 5.5% were seropositive. After 5\/21\/20, no screened patient (n=605) tested PCR positive. In the month prior to screening (3\/17\/20-4\/19\/20), 24 of 625 patients initiating external radiation had treatment interrupted due to COVID-19 infection (3.8%) vs 7 of 600 patients (1.1%) in the month post screening (4\/20\/20-5\/24\/20) (p=0.002). Conclusions: State-wide mitigation efforts, coupled with intensive departmental screening, helped prevent interruptions in radiation during the COVID-19 epidemic that could have compromised treatment efficacy.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean M McBride","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Bundick","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harper Hubbeling","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Morgan Freret","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Leslie Modlin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Mini Kamboj","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Oren Cahlon","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel Gomez","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174417","rel_title":"Causal associations between COVID-19 and Atrial Fibrillation: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174417","rel_abs":"Abstract Background Observational studies showed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attacks universally and its most menacing progression uniquely endangers the elderly with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether COVID-19 is causally related to increasing susceptibility and severity of atrial fibrillation (AF), the main form of CVD, remains still unknown. Methods The study aims to investigate the bidirectional causal relations of COVID-19 with AF using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Results MR evidence suggested genetically predicted severe COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher risk of AF (odds ratio [OR], 1.041; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.007-1.076; P = 0.017), while genetically predicted AF was not causally associated with severe COVID-19 (OR, 0.831; 95% CI, 1.619-1.115; P=0.217). There was limited evidence to support association of genetically proxied COVID-19 with risk of AF (OR, 1.051; 95% CI, 0.991-1.114; P=0.097), and vice versa (OR, 0.163; 95% CI, 0.004-6.790; P=0.341). MR-Egger indicated no evidence of pleiotropic bias. Conclusion Overall, severe COVID-19 may causally affect AF through independent biological pathway. Survivors from severe COVID-19 might be of high risk of AF in the future.

Here we test the suitability of different RNA extraction methods for integration into a diagnostic workflow for coronavirus testing. Methods: We applied six RNA extraction methods on the same 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples and quantified their results by subsequent reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of three viral genes. These methods included a) column-based extraction, b) phenol-chloroform extraction, as well as c) extraction using magnetic beads (i.e., one commercial kit as well as three different magnetic beads in combination with home-brewed buffers and solutions). Results: We achieved diagnostic-quality RT-PCR results with all methods, and there was no significant difference between the tested methods, except for one magnetic bead protocol with home-brewed buffers, in which the number of positive tested genes was significantly lower. Conclusions: Five of the six RNA extraction methods are interchangeable in a diagnostic workflow. Since some methods are more scalable than others, and have comparable results on RT-PCR quantitation, they may be more amenable to high-throughput sample processing pipelines.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ossia M Eichhoff","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland; Faculty of Medicine, University of Zurich, 8006 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elisa Bellini","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland Switzerland; Faculty of Medicine, University of Zurich, 8006 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto Lienhard","author_inst":"ADMED Microbiologie, 2300 La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Wendelin J.

Overproduction of cytokines triggered by COVID-19 infection, known as \"cytokine storm\", is a highly risk factor associated with disease severity. However, how COVID-19 infection induce cytokine storm is still largely unknown. Accumulating in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that gut is also susceptible to COVID19 infection: Human intestinal organoids, an in vitro model which mimic the specific cell type and spatial structure of the intestine, were susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection; A significant fraction of patients reported gut symptoms; Viral RNA may persist for more than 30 days and infectious virus could be isolated in fecal samples. The gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the host immune system with symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms. The bacteria resident in our gastrointestinal tract, known as gut microbiota, is important to maintain the homeostasis of our immune system. While imbalance of gut microbiota, or dysbiosis, is associated with multiple inflammation diseases5. It's possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to alternation of gut microbiota thus worsen the host symptom. IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced multiple enteric cells, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), immune cells as well as enteric nervous system, and was shown to increase in the serum of COVID-19 patients. Immunoglobin A (IgA) is mainly produced in the mucosal surfaces, in humans 40-60mg kg-1 day-1 than all other immunoglobulin isotypes combined, and at least 80% of all plasma cells are located in the intestinal lamina propria. Recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the serum is positively correlate with the disease severity in COVID-19 patients11.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. Methods We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using NPS and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. Results In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence, 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva. Conclusion Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity.

In such cases, the ability to rapidly and objectively determine a patient's acuity and predict near-term care needs is a major challenge. At issue is the clinician's ability to correctly identify patients at risk for subsequent rapid clinical deterioration. Data-driven tools that can support such determinations in real-time may be a valuable adjunct to clinician judgement during COVID-19 surges. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the Rothman Index (RI) predictive model in distinguishing the risk of subsequent deterioration or elevated care needs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital admission. Methods: We evaluated the initial RI score on admission to predict COVID-19 patient risk for 216 COVID-19 patients discharged from March 21st to June 7th, 2020 at Sinai LifeBridge Hospital and 1,453 COVID-19 patients discharged from any of Yale New Haven Health System's Yale New Haven, Bridgeport, and Greenwich hospitals from April 1st to April 28th, 2020. In-hospital mortality as a function of age and RI on admission for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were compared. AUC values using each COVID-19 patient's initial RI on admission to predict in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU utilization were computed, as were precision and recall for mortality prediction at specific RI thresholds. Results: The RI computed at the time of admission provides a high degree of objective discrimination to differentiate the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations at the outset of hospitalization. The high risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 20-30% of the COVID-19 positive population with mortality rates from 40-50%. The low risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 40%-55% of the population with mortality rates ranging from 1%-8%. Of note is that COVID-19 patients who present with heightened but generally unremarkable acuity can be identified early as having considerably elevated risk for subsequent physiological deterioration. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated mortality rates compared to non-COVID-19 medical service patients and may be subject to rapid deterioration following hospital admission. A lack of predictive indicators for identifying patients at high risk of subsequent deterioration or death can pose a challenge to clinicians. The RI has excellent performance characteristics when stratifying risk among COVID-19 patients at the time of admission. The RI can assist clinicians in real-time with a high degree of objective discrimination by segmenting the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations. This supports rapid and optimal patient bed assignment and resource allocation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Beals","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jaime Barnes","author_inst":"Sinai LifeBridge Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Durand","author_inst":"Sinai LifeBridge Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joan Rimar","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Donohue","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mahfuz Hoq","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Bridgeport Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathy Belk","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California Irvine Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Rothman","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174326","rel_title":"Topological data analysis model for the spread of the coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174326","rel_abs":"We apply topological data analysis, specifically the Mapper algorithm, to the U.S. COVID-19 data.

At the same time, they implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to curtail local spread. We assess the risk of importation of COVID-19 in locations that are at that point without infection or where local chains of transmission have extinguished, and evaluate the role of quarantine in this risk. ## Methods A stochastic $SLIAR$ epidemic model is used. The effect of the rate, size, and nature of importations is studied and compared to that of NPI on the risk of importation-induced local transmission chains. The effect of quarantine on the rate of importations is assessed, as well as its efficacy as a function of its duration. ## Results The rate of importations plays a critical role in determining the risk that case importations lead to local transmission chains, more so than local transmission characteristics, i.e., strength of NPI. The latter influences the severity of the outbreaks. Quarantine after arrival in a location is an efficacious way to reduce the rate of importations. ## Conclusions Locations that see no or low level local transmission should ensure that the rate of importations remains low. A high level of compliance with post-arrival quarantine followed by testing achieves this objective with less of an impact than travel restrictions or bans.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julien Arino","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Bajeux","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Portet","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"James Watmough","author_inst":"University of New Brunswick"},{"author_name":"Thomas Donohue","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mahfuz Hoq","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Bridgeport Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathy Belk","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California Irvine Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Rothman","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20173799","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and the model for predicting the occurrence of critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study.","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20173799","rel_abs":"Background: The present study aim to comprehensively report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients and to develop a multi-feature fusion model for predicting the critical ill probability.

Conclusions: The prevalence of critical ill was relatively high and the model may help the clinicians to identify the patients with high risk for developing the critical ill, thus to conduct timely and targeted treatment to reduce the mortality rate.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Ouyang","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng Shan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaling Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Miaomiao Qi","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Xia","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Dongqing Gu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ben Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20173179","rel_title":"Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Covid-19 pandemic: a global socioeconomic analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20173179","rel_abs":"Socioeconomic achievement of WASH (access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene) services are being acknowledged as anticipatory actors, indispensable in safeguarding health during this Covid19 pandemic. However, on a global scale, it is currently not clear whether deprivation or non obtainability of which of the various WASH services are closely related to Covid19 dynamics and up to which degree. We have analyzed data (March to June 2020) related to five Covid19 indicators for most of the countries in the world with indicators of safe water, sanitation and hygiene to understand this. We have found a strong positive correlation between lesser effects of Covid19 and better access to safe water, sanitation as well as hygiene throughout this time for most of the indicators. However, some indicators show the opposite nature of the relationship, for which we have given probable explanation accordingly. The hypothesis of an inversely proportional association between Covid-19 and poor WASH facilities on a global scale is confirmed in this study. We propose that this study should be perceived as an expanded comprehensive view on the complexities of WASH and Covid19 interrelationships, which could help to shape an agenda for research into some unanswered questions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ajishnu Roy","author_inst":"Presidency University"},{"author_name":"Aman Basu","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Studies, Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Science), Visva-Bharati, West Bengal - 731235, India"},{"author_name":"Kousik Pramanick","author_inst":"Integrative Biology Research Unit, Department of Life Sciences, Presidency University, 86\/1, College Street, Kolkata - 700073, India"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaling Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Miaomiao Qi","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Xia","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Dongqing Gu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ben Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20147595","rel_title":"The operational impact of deploying SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in countries of the WHO African Region","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20147595","rel_abs":"Background: After SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available, they will be deployed to many countries with limited immunization systems. Methods: We conducted a cold chain capacity assessment of a simulated country in the WHO African Region. We combined region-specific data regarding immunization, population, healthcare workforce, and cold storage capacity (upper and lower range and quartile values for national and subnational levels). We used seasonal influenza vaccines as proxies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We evaluated the increase in vaccine doses to be administered, doses administered per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for SARS-CoV-2 campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. Findings: Compared to routine immunization, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would increase monthly doses administered when targeting risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (29.9%), chronic diseases patients (101.5%), and healthcare workers (1.2%). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase doses administered per vaccinator for risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (32.5%), chronic diseases patients (110.4%), or healthcare workers (1.4%). Routine vaccine volumes already exceed national level storage capacity for at least 75% of African Region countries, but subnational levels would have sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in all but the lower 25% of African Region countries. Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold chain capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would add volume to national level stores already at their limits, but substantial capacity exists at subnational levels for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Immediate attention to strengthening delivery systems is essential to support pandemic vaccine responses in the African Region.

Hence, this study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among ophthalmic HCP towards COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of lockdown among ophthalmic HCP including consultant ophthalmologist, resident, optometrist, ophthalmic assistant, nursing staff, and other paramedics of eye care centers in Nepal. The KAP questionnaire was designed and distributed online. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test, Pearson correlation, and binary logistic regression. All tests were performed at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 694 participants, the majority were male (59.1%) from the age group 31-40 years (41.5%) and tertiary eye center (68.9%). Among ophthalmic HCP, there were 29.8% consultants ophthalmologist, 22.6% residents, 23.3% optometrist, 15% ophthalmic assistant, and 9.2% other ophthalmic paramedics, 11.7% working as front-liners in COVID-19 centers. Findings showed, 98.1% had good knowledge, 59.4% had a positive attitude and only 13.3% had good practice regarding COVID-19. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated the age of HCP to be a significant determinant of good knowledge (Crude Odds Ratio (COR)=0.72, 95%CI=0.62-0.82), positive attitude (COR=0.92, 95%CI=0.90-0.94) and good practice (COR=1.16, 95%CI=1.10-1.21). Lower odds of poor practice was seen among junior resident (COR=0.26, 95% CI=0.14-0.47) and higher odds of poor practice was seen among HCP with job experience of 5-10 years (COR=2.38, 95% CI=1.23-4.60) towards COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The majority of ophthalmic HCP have good knowledge, insufficient positive attitude, and inadequate evidence-based practice towards the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal.

As universities re-open, it is imperative to understand the added value of measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Methods. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of common public health interventions used by universities to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We use a Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations, cycling once per day. The model computes changes in infection among interacting groups of university affiliates both on and off campus. Interventions are compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines at three different levels of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university in terms of incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results. When there are 100 infectious cases per 100,000 people in the community (0.1%), a symptom-checking mobile application is cost-effective relative to CDC guidelines alone. If the community active infectious case rate reaches 1%, providing high quality, 2-ply masks will be cost-saving. As the community prevalence rate of infectious cases reaches 2%, thermal imaging cameras cost $965,070\/QALY gained (95% credible interval [CrI] = $198,821 QALY gained, $2.15 million\/QALY gained). One-time PCR testing on entry costs $1.08 million\/QALY gained (95% CrI = $170,703 QALY gained, $3.33 million\/QALY gained). Weekly PCR testing costs $820,119 \/QALY gained (95% CrI = $452,673 QALY gained, $1.68 million\/QALY gained). Upgrades to ventilation systems or installation of far-UVC light systems will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000\/QALY gained if aerosols account for 86% of all on-campus transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. The value of commonly used interventions for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 varies greatly with the rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zafar Zafari","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Katia Korvizhkin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins"},{"author_name":"Lee Goldman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Peter Muennig","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Bikram Adhikari","author_inst":"B.P.

Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, and preprints up to July 20, 2020. We included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CST. We pooled adjusted effect estimates of mortality and other outcomes using a random effect model, among studies at low or moderate risk for bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Results: Out of 1067 citations screened for eligibility, one RCT and 19 cohort studies were included (16,977 hospitalized patients). Ten studies (1 RCT and 9 cohorts) with 10,278 patients examined the effect of CST on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.69-1.22, I2=81.94 %). This effect was observed across all stages of disease severity. Four cohort studies examined the effect of CST on composite outcome of death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation need. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.41(0.23-0.73, I2=78.69%). Six cohort studies examined the effect of CST on delayed viral clearance. The pooled adjusted RR was 1.47(95% CI 1.11-1.93, I2=43.38%). Conclusion: Heterogeneous and low certainty cumulative evidence suggests that CST lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality while possibly delaying viral clearance in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Because of the discordant results between the single RCT and observational studies, more research should continue to identify the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients population that could benefit from CST.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haytham Tlayjeh","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City"},{"author_name":"Olaa Mhish","author_inst":"Alfaisal University"},{"author_name":"Mushira Enani","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Alya Alruwaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Rana Tleyjeh","author_inst":"Alfaisal University"},{"author_name":"Lukman Thalib","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Leslie Hassett","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Arabi","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Imad Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele","author_inst":"Independent Consultant"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Neuzil","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20171405","rel_title":"OpenSAFELY: Do adults prescribed Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have an increased risk of death from COVID-19?","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20171405","rel_abs":"Importance: There has been speculation that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may negatively affect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, yet clinical evidence is limited.

Setting: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used routine clinical data from >17 million patients in England linked to death data from the Office for National Statistics. Participants: Study 1: General population (people with an NSAID prescription in the last three years). Study 2: people with rheumatoid arthritis\/osteoarthritis. Exposures: Current NSAID prescription within the 4 months before 1st March 2020. Main Outcome and Measure: We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 related death in people currently prescribed NSAIDs, compared with those not currently prescribed NSAIDs, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and other medications. Results: In Study 1, we included 535,519 current NSAID users and 1,924,095 non-users in the general population. The crude HR for current use was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46), versus non-use. We observed no evidence of difference in risk of COVID-19 related death associated with current use (HR, 0.95, 95% CI, 0.80-1.13) in the fully adjusted model.

Since there are no proven vaccine and treatment in place against the disease, controlling strategy mainly rely on preventive measures. However, data on the extent of implementing physical distancing and other preventive measures were under estimated. This study, therefore, investigated these gaps among people in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a community based cross-sectional study in Arba Minch town; from 15-30 June 2020. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and checklist. Then, data were cleaned, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.4.2, and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Results Of the total participants (459), 43.6% achieved above the mean score (6) on preventive measures of COVID-19. Only 29.8% of participants kept the recommended physical distance, and surprisingly, in all public gathering places the distance was not kept totally. In addition, of the total participants, only 37.7% had face-mask use practice; 20.5% had hand sanitizer use practice, and 13.1% were measuring their body temperature every two weeks. Moreover, 42.5% of participants avoided attendance in public gatherings; 44.7% stopped touching their nose, eye and mouth; 55.6% practiced stay-at-home; and 60% had frequent hand washing practice. Majority of participants (66.7%) practiced covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing; 68.2% had treatment seeking behavior if they experience flue like symptoms; 69.1% practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms; and 89.3% avoided hand shaking. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town. Thus, an urgent call for action is demanding to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 as early as possible before it brings a devastating impact.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mekuria Asnakew Asfaw","author_inst":"Arba Minch University"},{"author_name":"Tsegaye Yohannes","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Chuchu Churko","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Alemayehu Bekele","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Teklu Wegayehu","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

The European Commission has outlined its commitment to reducing health inequalities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a disruptive event with global, national, and local effects on every aspect of a society's life. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify and display health (in)equality induced by COVID-19 over time and on different geographic scales (global, continental, national, regional). We aimed to perform a study of (in)equality regarding COVID-19 related incidences and deaths using the Gini index (GI) that was developed to explore inequality in wealth within or between nations. The GI is a relative measure which quantifies the ratio of the mean absolute difference between observations and their mean: GI=0 describes a situation where everybody owns the same, GI=1 corresponds to one person owning the entire wealth of a society. A specific focus of our analysis is the (in)equality of case-fatality rates. We use global, nation- and statewide data to evaluate the heterogeneity at different levels. We also reflect on the suitability of the Gini index to monitor equality aspects of the pandemic. Data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic show a considerable amount of heterogeneity in the global distribution of incidences and deaths. Only few countries contribute largely to the total incidence and death toll. Inequality may result from heterogeneous reporting systems, heterogeneous policy making to fight the pandemic, heterogeneous health systems, and demographic structures. Inequality decreases when going from continental to national or regional levels. Time trends on national level reflect local outbreaks. There is heterogeneity in case fatality rates, too. There is also a specific numeric artefact of the GI: Even if many smaller regions have no COVID-19 related deaths at all, and one region has low (but still non-negligible) number of deaths the corresponding GI is near to 1. We used the Gini index to reflect inequality between incidence and death rates of nations or geographic regions. The interpretation of the differences between reported GIs is not straightforward. However, combined with the information presented by maps, the GI is a useful tool.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsi Manz","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Mansmann","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Chuchu Churko","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Alemayehu Bekele","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Teklu Wegayehu","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Saliva was evaluated as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test on the cobas 6800 instrument. Methods: Saliva specimens submitted from various patient populations under investigation for COVID-19 from March-July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and vortexed with glass beads. The processed saliva samples were tested using a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (LightMix) in comparison to the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test. Results: 22\/64 (34.4%) of the saliva samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the LightMix and cobas assays were 100%. There was no cross-contamination of samples observed on the cobas 6800. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas 6800 (1\/128, 0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs\/VTM and plasma samples. Conclusions: Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas 6800, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nancy Matic","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Tanya Lawson","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Gordon Ritchie","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Stefanovic","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Victor Leung","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Champagne","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Marc G.

In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known. Methods We conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness. Results Expert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5..55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4..55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2..27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers. Conclusions We interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen RJ Sparks","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"William P Aspinall","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Roger Cooke","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jenni Barclay","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jane Scarrow","author_inst":"University of Grenada"},{"author_name":"Christopher F.

The two main components of the simulation model are the stochastic modeling of the admission of new patients and the patient flow through the hospital facilities. For the patient arrival process, we analyze different models based on growth curves of the twenty most affected countries (until June 15) and propose the use of the Gompertz curve. The length of stay is divided into several stages, each one modeled separately. We analyze the starting of the simulation model, which requires different procedures depending on the information available about the patients currently hospitalized. We also report the use of this simulation model during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Autonomous Community of Navarre, in Spain.

Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of 1,500 UK adults, recruited from an existing online research panel. Data were collected between 14th and 17th July 2020. We used linear regression analyses to investigate associations between intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available to you and socio-demographic factors, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccine attitudes and beliefs, attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19, and attitudes and beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccination. Results: 64% of participants reported being likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19; 27% were unsure and 9% reported being unlikely to be vaccinated. Personal and clinical characteristics, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccination beliefs, and beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 and a COVID-19 vaccination explained 77% of the variance in vaccination intention. Intention to be vaccinated was associated with more positive general COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, weaker beliefs that the vaccination would cause side effects or be unsafe, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 to others but not oneself, older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019\/20). Conclusions: Despite uncertainty around the details of a COVID-19 vaccination, most participants reported intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Actual uptake will likely be lower. Vaccination intention reflects general vaccine beliefs and attitudes.

In March 2020 New York City became the USA epicenter for the pandemic. On March 27, 2020 a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was immobilized, and physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed peribronchial cuffing with bronchiectasis, and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, though persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs. This case series describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of tigers and lions infected with SARS-CoV-2, and describes the duration of viral RNA fecal shedding in these cases. This report documents the first known natural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals in the USA, and is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in non-domestic felids.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susan L.

Binding of the viral spike protein (SARS-2-S) to cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates host cell infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to ACE2, the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to HDL and that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake pathway to facilitate its entry. SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues. These findings revealed a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry and could provide a new target to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Congwen Wei","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Luming Wan","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Qiulin Yan","author_inst":"Institute of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Yanhong Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Sun","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaopan Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Gong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Fan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, the 960th Hospital of PLA, Jinan 250031, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Yang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Third Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, P.R.

Nsp10 and Nsp16 form a complex responsible for the capping of mRNA at the 5' terminus. In the methylation reaction the S-adenosyl-L-methionine serves as the donor of the methyl group that is transferred to Cap-0 at the first transcribed nucleotide to create Cap-1. The presence of Cap-1 makes viral RNAs mimic the host transcripts and prevents their degradation. To investigate the 2'-O methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10\/16, we applied fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) which allows for physiological temperature data collection from thousands of crystals, significantly reducing the x-ray dose while maintaining a biologically relevant temperature. We determined crystal structures of Nsp10\/16 that revealed the states before and after the methylation reaction, for the first time illustrating coronavirus Nsp10\/16 complexes with the m7GpppAm2'-O Cap-1, where 2'OH of ribose is methylated. We compare these structures with structures of Nsp10\/16 at 297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal. This data provide important mechanistic insight and can be used to design small molecules that inhibit viral RNA maturation making SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to host innate response.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mateusz Wilamowski","author_inst":"UChicago"},{"author_name":"Darren Sherrell","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"George Minasov","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Youngchang Kim","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Ludmilla Shuvalova","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Alex Lavens","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ryan Chard","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Natalia Maltseva","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Monica Rosas-Lemus","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nicklaus Saint","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ian T Foster","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Karolina Michalska","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Karla J Satchell","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Joachimiak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Huilong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Peng Du","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Yulong Zong","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Yin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Wanchuan Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Peng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Haotian Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd.

The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. Many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we highlight the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabateeshan Mathavarajah","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Amina K.
