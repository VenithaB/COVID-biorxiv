Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used (1) RNA transcript standards, (2) full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, (3) pre-COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) clinical samples from COVID-19 patients to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of the qRT-PCR primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 virus copies per reaction, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charite) confirmatory primer-probe set which has low sensitivity. Our findings characterize the limitations of currently used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. Twitter reflected the clear, structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify potential sources of misinformation as well as key actors (especially early adopters) and influencers. Conclusions: Traditional and social media not only reflect reality, but also create it. Polish authorities, having a reliable analysis of the perception of the problem, could optimally prepare and manage the social dimension of the current epidemic and future ones. Due to filter bubbles observed on Twitter, public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected. For greater penetration, it might be necessary to diversify information channels to reach as many people as possible which might already be happening. Moreover, it might be necessary to prevent the spread of disinformation, which is now possible due to the special law on combating COVID-2019.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrzej Jarynowski","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Research"},{"author_name":"Monika Wojta-Kempa","author_inst":"Affiliation: Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health Science, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland"},{"author_name":"Vitaly Belik","author_inst":"Affiliation: System Modeling Group, Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Joseph R Fauver","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Isabel M.

Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Mohit Manoj Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard H Rand","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Awadhesh Kumar Singh","author_inst":"GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Anoop Misra","author_inst":"Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaney C.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel epidemic model called SEIR-HC, which is a novel epidemic model with two different social circles. Using the model alongside the exclusive optimization algorithm, the spread process of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city is reproduced and then the propagation characteristics and unknown data are estimated. Furthermore, the control measures implemented in Wuhan are assessed and the control methodology of COVID-19 is discussed to provide guidance for limiting the epidemic spread.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongjun Zhu","author_inst":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications"},{"author_name":"Mohit Manoj Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard H Rand","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Awadhesh Kumar Singh","author_inst":"GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Anoop Misra","author_inst":"Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaney C.

Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Casey M Zipfel","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bansal","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Richard H Rand","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Awadhesh Kumar Singh","author_inst":"GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Anoop Misra","author_inst":"Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaney C.

Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical.. Our model is easily modified to take other aspects of the socio-pandemic interaction into account.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Axel G Rossberg","author_inst":"School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Robert J.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented and cascading threat to the health and economic prosperity of the world's population. Objectives. To understand whether the institutional and cultural context influences the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods. At the ecological level, regression coefficients are examined to figure out contextual variables influencing the pandemic's exponential growth rate across 96 countries. Results. While a strong institutional context is negatively associated with the outbreak (B = -0.55 ... -0.64, p < 0.001), the pandemic's growth rate is steeper in countries with a quality education system (B = 0.33, p < 0.001). Countries with an older population are more affected (B = 0.46, p < 0.001). Societies with individualistic (rather than collectivistic) values experience a flatter rate of pathogen proliferation (B = -0.31, p < 0.001), similarly for higher levels of power distance (B = -0.32, p < 0.001). Hedonistic values, that is seeking indulgence and not enduring restraints, are positively related to the outbreak (B = 0.23, p = 0.001). Conclusions. The results emphasize the need for public policy makers to pay close attention to the institutional and cultural context in their respective countries when instigating measures aimed at constricting the pandemic's growth.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wolfgang Messner","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Robert J.

However, specific antiviral drugs are still unavailable, and pateints are managed by multiple complementary treatments. Methods The electronic medical records of COVID-19 patients where basic information, complete blood count, coagulation profile, inflammatory cytokines and serum biochemical indicators in 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and 21 without LMWH) that were retrospectively analyzed to compare and evaluate the effect of LMWH treatment on disease progression. Findings 42 patients with COVID-19 treated at the hospital between February 1 and March 15, 2020, were selected for the study, of which 21 underwent LMWH treatment (LMWH group), and 21 did not (Control), during hospitalization. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.011, respectively). Changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.002;p=0.035). Strikingly, in the LMWH group, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (p=0.006). Besides, the changes in IL-6 levels in the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (p=0.031). Interpretation LMWH improves the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing IL-6 and increasing lymphocyte %. It appears that LMWH can be used as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19, paving the way for a subsequent well-controlled clinical trial.

Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1\/2\/2020 and 3\/25\/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists. Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were analyzed. Instances of notes referencing depression or anxiety decreased 75-81% in outpatient settings with onset of coronavirus in March 2019, and by 44-45% in emergency departments. In adjusted logistic regression, presence of individual psychiatric symptoms in outpatient notes was associated with significant decreases in likelihood of coronavirus testing (for depression, OR=0.636, 95% CI 0.606-0.667). Conversely, presence of violence in an emergency department note was associated with greater likelihood of testing (OR=1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761). Conclusions and Relevance: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms in both outpatient and emergency department settings diminished sharply in the context of increasing coronavirus infection in Massachusetts, suggesting that efforts to provide additional resources to manage psychiatric symptoms will be needed.

Hence, early surveillance and public health emergency disposal are considered crucial to curb this emerging infectious disease. However, studies that investigated the early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China are relatively few. We aimed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for prevention and control between COVID-19 and H7N9 avian influenza, which was commended by the international community, in China. Methods: A case-comparison study was conducted using a set of six key time nodes to form a reference framework for evaluating early surveillance and public health emergency disposal between H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai, China and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Findings: A report to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, for the first hospitalized patient was sent after 6 and 20 days for H7N9 avian influenza and COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the pathogen was identified faster in the case of COVID-19 than in the case of H7N9 avian influenza (12 days vs. 31 days). The government response regarding COVID-19 was 10 days later than that regarding avian influenza. The entire process of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal lasted 5 days longer in COVID-19 than in H7N9 avian influenza (46 days vs. 41 days). Conclusions: The identification of the unknown pathogen improved in China between the outbreaks of avian influenza and COVID-19. The longer emergency disposal period in the case of COVID-19 could be attributed to the government's slower response to the epidemic. Improving public health emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of emerging infectious diseases and public health crisis in the future.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiantian Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenming Shi","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ge Bai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ruiming Dai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Li Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"YIHUI LIU","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), Wuhan, P.R.

Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs). Clearly, the strategy will have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sake J de Vlas","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luc E.

The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19.

While detailed epidemiological models are certainly needed, I suggest here an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries at the John Hopkins University database that became the worldwide reference for the pandemics. I show that, after few days from the beginning of the outbreak, the apparent death rate can be extrapolated to infinite time through regularized regression such as rescaled ridge regression. The variation from country to country of these extrapolated death rates appears to depend almost only (r^2=0.91) on the ratio between performed tests and detected cases even when the instantaneous apparent lethality rates are as different as 9% in Italy and 0.4% in Germany. Extrapolating to the limit of infinite number of tests, I obtain a death rate of 0.012+\/- 0.012, in agreement with other estimates. The inverse relationship between the extrapolated death rate and the intensity tests allows estimating that more than 50% of cases were undetected in most countries, with more than 90% undetected cases in countries severely hit by the epidemics such as Italy. Finally, I propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and deceased persons as an indicator that can anticipate the halting of the epidemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ugo Bastolla","author_inst":"CSIC"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Shakibi","author_inst":"California State University Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Takanao Tanaka","author_inst":"Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary D'Alton","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric J Forman","author_inst":"Columbia University Fertility Center"},{"author_name":"Zev Williams","author_inst":"Columbia University Fertility Center"},{"author_name":"Li Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"YIHUI LIU","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST), Wuhan, P.R.

We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. Regardless of the best fitting law, many countries can be shown to follow a common trajectory that is similar to Italy (the epicenter at the time of analysis), but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with \"younger\" epidemics, i.e. countries where the epidemic started more recently, tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that were closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may be a natural progression of the epidemic in each country. On the practical side, this indicates that (i) even in the absence of strict social distancing interventions, exponential growth is not an accurate predictor of longer term infection spread, and (ii) a deviation from exponential spread and a reduction of estimated doubling times do not necessarily indicate successful interventions, which are instead indicated by a transition to a reduced power or by a deviation from power law behavior.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia L.

Methods Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID-19 HCWs) from a single-center. Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively. Follow-up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020. Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed. Findings A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs. COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs. Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk. An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number =1.27 [1.06, 1.61]. By reducing the average contact rate per HCW by a 1.35 factor and susceptibility by a 1.40 factor, we can avoid an outbreak of the basic case among HCWs. Interpretation Poor sleep quality and high working pressure were positively associated with high risks of COVID-19. A novel IBM of COVID-19 transmission is suitable for simulating different outbreak patterns in a hospital setting.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yansen Bai Sr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qimin Huang Sr.","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Han Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"David Gurarie","author_inst":"Center for Global Health and Diseases, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station"},{"author_name":"Fei Fan","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary Ann Horn","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xu","author_inst":"Computer and Data Science Department, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Anirban Mondal","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospitaol, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jiang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel J.

At present, we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The findings are presented and discussed by different clinical characteristics. Therefore, our review may provide guidance for clinical decision-making and optimizes resource allocation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lizhen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"mao yaqian","author_inst":"Department of endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Han Wang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"David Gurarie","author_inst":"Center for Global Health and Diseases, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, College Station"},{"author_name":"Fei Fan","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary Ann Horn","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xu","author_inst":"Computer and Data Science Department, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Anirban Mondal","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospitaol, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jiang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel J.

Design: A pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China Patients: A total of 42 adults with severe COVID-19. Interventions: Participants in the CHM plus standard care group received CHM and standard care, and the control group received standard care alone. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment at 7 days. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]; 21 [50%] were aged [&ge;] 65 years; and 35 [83%] women, 42 (100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454). Three (2 from the CHM plus group and 1 from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 18% (5) vs 14% (2), 71% (20) vs 64% (9), and 0% (0) vs 7% (1) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. CHM effects in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong-an Ye","author_inst":"Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"G-CHAMPS collaborative group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Yian Kim Tan","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Sean Wei Xiang Ong","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Marcus Gum","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Sok Kiang Lau","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Sutjipto","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Pei Hua Lee","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Than The Son","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Barnaby E.

As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide. In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate. In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing, quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections. Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease. System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and explain changing systems. The system dynamics approach can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to test the effect of different control measures. The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA(R) from Iseesystems) that can be customized to any area\/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios. Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections and ultimately, fatalities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"CESAR BORDEHORE","author_inst":"Universidad de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Miriam Navarro","author_inst":"University of Alicante"},{"author_name":"Zaida Herrador","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ministry of Health, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eva S.

We predicted the binding affinity between 9-mer and 15-mer peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome for 9,360 class I and 8,445 class II HLA alleles, respectively. We identified 368,145 unique combinations of peptide-HLA complexes (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity less than 500nM, and observed significant overlap between class I and II predicted pMHCs. Using simulated populations derived from worldwide HLA frequency data, we identified sets of epitopes predicted in at least 90% of the population in 57 countries. We also developed a method to prioritize pMHCs for specific populations.

The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product.

The NCOVID-19 virus is spread among individuals through close communication in the form of droplets, not via airborne. Those individuals are at risk of infection who are in close contact with a NCOVID-19 patient or who take care of NCOVID-19 patients. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of any infection in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of basic knowledge and all procedures concerning prevention and protection from NCOVID-19. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the awareness level of healthcare workers toward NCOVID-2019 in Pakistan. Material and Methods A questionnaire was generated according to WHO information that was circulated among the healthcare workers of different hospitals and medical institutes of Pakistan. Calculated sample size was 650. Conclusion Healthcare workers have insufficient knowledge of preventive measures and infection control. The authorities must take initiatives on urgent basis to increase the awareness among the healthcare workers and general public also so that the drastic circumstances can be avoided in the developing country like Pakistan.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ambrina Qureshi","author_inst":"Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bushra Imdad","author_inst":"Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Uzair Abbas","author_inst":"Dow University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amit Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Indore"},{"author_name":"Anusha Kalbasi","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Arinze Umera","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Uzal Umar","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Simeon Omale","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Nnadi","author_inst":"Plateau State University, Bokkos"},{"author_name":"John Chinyere Aguiyi","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Donald K.

As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies. These delays are likely to produce significant, on-going harm to public health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Adolph","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenya Amano","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Bree Bang-Jensen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nancy Fullman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John Wilkerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Arinze Umera","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Uzal Umar","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Simeon Omale","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Nnadi","author_inst":"Plateau State University, Bokkos"},{"author_name":"John Chinyere Aguiyi","author_inst":"African Centre of Excellence in Phytomedicine Research and development (ACEPRD), University of Jos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Donald K.
