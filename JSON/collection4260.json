We examined if serum levels of ACE2, the cellular entry point for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were altered in these high-risk groups. Methods: Associations of serum ACE2 levels to hypertension, T2D, obesity, CHD, smokers and males in a single center population-based study of 5457 Icelanders from the Age, Gene\/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) of the elderly (mean age 75+\/-6 years). Results: Smokers, males, and individuals with T2D or obesity have altered serum levels of ACE2 that may influence productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in these high-risk groups. Conclusion: ACE2 levels are upregulated in some patient groups with comorbidities linked to COVID-19 and as such may have an emerging role as a circulating biomarker for severity of outcome in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valur Emilsson","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Elias F Gudmundsson","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Thor Aspelund","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Brynjolfur G Jonsson","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gudjonsson","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Lenore J Launer","author_inst":"Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD 20892-9205, USA"},{"author_name":"John R Lamb","author_inst":"GNF Novartis, 10675 John Jay Hopkins Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA"},{"author_name":"Valborg Gudmundsdottir","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Lori L Jennings","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, 22 Windsor Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA"},{"author_name":"Vilmundur Gudnason","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20122176","rel_title":"What variables can better predict the number of infections and deaths worldwide by SARS-CoV-2?

We also studied if the predictive power of these variables changed during a 4 months period (March, April, May and June). We approached data in two different ways, cumulative data and non-cumulative data. The number of deaths by Covid-19 can always be predicted with great accuracy from the number of infected, regardless of the characteristics of the country. Inbound tourism emerged as the variable that best predicts the number of infected (and, consequently, the number of deaths) happening in the different countries. Electricity consumption and air pollution of a country (CO2 emissions, nitrous oxide and methane) are also capable of predicting, with great precision, the number of infections and deaths from Covid-19. Characteristics such as the area and population of a country can also predict, although to a lesser extent, the number of infected and dead. All predictive variables remained significant through time. In contrast, a series of variables, which in principle would seem to have a greater influence on the evolution of Covid-19 (hospital bed density, Physicians per 1000 people, Researches in R & D, urban population, etc.), turned out to have very little -or none- predictive power. Our results explain why countries that opted for travel restrictions and social withdrawal policies at a very early stage of the pandemic outbreak, obtained better results. Preventive policies proved to be the key, rather than having large hospital and medical resources.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Garcia Garcia de Alcaniz","author_inst":"Veterinary Faculty Complutense University Madrid Genetics Department"},{"author_name":"Julia Romero-Lopez","author_inst":"Veterinary Faculty Complutense University Madrid Genetics Department"},{"author_name":"Rocio P.

There is no vaccine or antivirus drug found against this virus while multiple research groups are actively working on a suitable candidate. The only available mode of minimizing the disease burden has been to control its transmission among the population. Since the occurrence of first COVID 19 local case on 11 March 2020, the government of Sri Lanka introduced serious social distancing and public health interventions in its fullest capacity as a developing nation to effectively combat with the disease spread. This study focuses to develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of this novel disease using an extended version of an SEIR compartmental structure considering the heterogeneity of cases such as asymptomatic, symptomatic with mild indications and the cases required intensive care treatments. All the measures and interventions are in progress with a significantly large social and economic cost, thus, optimal control techniques are used to identify the most appropriate strategies to minimize this cost. The results of the simulations prove that optimal control measures can be worked out as the epidemic curves are flattened while delaying the outbreak so that the health system might not be under pressure to treat and care the patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tharindu Wickramaarachchi Sr.","author_inst":"The Open University of sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Sanjeewa Perera Sr.","author_inst":"University of Colombo"},{"author_name":"Rocio P.

The first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by the contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and quickly turned into a pandemic. In Brazil, the first case occurred on January 23rd, 2020 but was officially reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health on February 25th. Since then, the number of deaths and people infected by COVID-19 in Brazil have been steadily increasing. Despite the underreporting of coronavirus cases by government agencies across the country, the State of Sao Paulo has the highest rate among all Brazilian States. Thus, it is essential to detect which areas contain the highest concentration of COVID-19 to implement public policies, to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. To identify these critical areas, we utilized daily confirmed case data from the Brasil.IO website between February 25th, 2020 to May 5th, 2020; which were aggregated to the municipality level. A prospective space-time scan statistic was applied to evaluate possible active clusters in three different time periods. The results visualize the space-time evolution and dynamics of COVID-19 clusters in the State of Sao Paulo. Since the first study period, the results highlight approximately 4.6 times the number of municipalities belonging to a significant cluster with a RR>1 on May 5th. These results can inform health authorities and public management to take the necessary measures to minimize the transmission of COVID-19 and track the evolution of significant space-time clusters.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Vicente Ferreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro"},{"author_name":"Marcos R Martines","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Rogerio H Toppa","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Luiza M Assuncao","author_inst":"State University of Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Michael Richard Desjardins","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eric M Delmelle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"John R Lamb","author_inst":"GNF Novartis, 10675 John Jay Hopkins Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA"},{"author_name":"Valborg Gudmundsdottir","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"},{"author_name":"Lori L Jennings","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, 22 Windsor Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA"},{"author_name":"Vilmundur Gudnason","author_inst":"Icelandic Heart Association"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20121830","rel_title":"Effect of gamma sterilization on filtering efficiency of various respiratory face-masks","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20121830","rel_abs":"Three types of respiratory masks viz N95, non-woven fabric and double layer cotton cloth are being used as an essential inhalation protective measure against COVID-19 by suppressing the entry of respiratory droplets.

In this paper, we propose a Flexible, Accurate and Speedy Test (FAST), which is faster and more accurate than any existing tests. FAST first forms small close contact subgroups, e.g. families and friends. It then pools subgroups to form larger groups before RT-PCR test is done. FAST needs a similar number of tests to Technion's method, but sharply reduces the FNR to a negligible level. For example, FAST brings down the number of false negatives in USA to just 2000, and it is seven times faster than individual testing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linjiajie Fang","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shen Ling","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Bing-Yi Jing","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qing Yang","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"V.

We present here an analysis of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, and explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number R0 to a target value R0target < 1, but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target R0target < 1, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests\/day to the number of new cases\/day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts of an infectious person, which would be high in densely populated regions with low levels of SD. We point out that, apart from R0, an important quantity is the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics which provides a more complete understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. Weak intervention strategies (that reduce R0 but not to a value less than 1) can reduce the peak values of infections and the asymptotic affected population. We provide simple analytic expressions for these in terms of the disease parameters and apply them in the Indian context to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic. We find that the predictions strongly depend on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arghya Das","author_inst":"International centre for theoretical sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Dhar","author_inst":"International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Anupam Kundu","author_inst":"International centre for theoretical sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Srashti Goyal","author_inst":"International centre for theoretical sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Lydia Z.

We assessed socio-demographic, professional, health and behavior parameters. The primary goal was to evaluate changes in urologists ' clinical practice and income after two months of COVID-19. We also looked at geographical differences based on the incidence rates of COVID-19 in different states. Results: Among 766 urologists who completed the survey, a reduction [&ge;] 50% of patient visits, elective and emergency surgeries was reported by 83.2%, 89.6% and 54.8%, respectively. An income reduction of [&ge;] 50% was reported by 54.3%. Measures to reduce costs were implemented by most. Video consultations were performed by 38.7%. Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (32.9%), reduced physical activity (60.0%), increased alcoholic intake (39.9%) and reduced sexual activity (34.9%). Finally, 13.5% of Brazilian urologists were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and about one third required hospitalization. Urologists from the highest COVID-19 incidence states were at a higher risk to have a reduction of patient visits and non-essential surgeries (OR=2.95, 95% CI 1.86 - 4.75; p < 0.0001) and of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR=4.36 95% CI 1.74 - 10.54, p = 0.012). Conclusions: COVID-19 produced massive disturbances in Brazilian urologists' practice, with major reductions in patient visits and surgical procedures. Distressing consequences were also observed on physicians' income, health and personal lives. These findings are probably applicable to other medical specialties.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristiano M Gomes","author_inst":"Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Luciano Favorito","author_inst":"Unidade de Pesquisa Urogenital, Rio de Janeiro State University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o Victor T Henriques","author_inst":"Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alfredo F Canalini","author_inst":"Division of Urology, Rio de Janeiro State University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Karin M.

The present work may serve as reference for resolving future lines of infection in the area and Europe especially after resumption of passenger flight connections to Athens and Greece during summer of 2020.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikolaos Spanakis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Katerina Kassela","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikolas Dovrolis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Maria Bampali","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Elisavet Gatzidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Athanasia Kafasi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Elisavet Froukala","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Stavropoulou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Lilakos","author_inst":"ANTISEL SA & Haematology Clinic, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Stavroula Veletza","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Athanasios Tsakris","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Karakasiliotis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.135806","rel_title":"A novel in-cell ELISA assay allows rapid and automated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 to analyse neutralizing antibodies and antiviral compounds","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.135806","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the most pressing medical and socioeconomic challenge. Constituting important correlates of protection, determination of virus-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is indispensable for convalescent plasma selection, vaccine candidate evaluation, and immunity certificates. In contrast to standard serology ELISAs, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) are laborious, time-consuming, expensive, and restricted to specialized laboratories. To replace microscopic counting-based SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs by a novel assay exempt from genetically modified viruses, which are inapplicable in most diagnostics departments, we established a simple, rapid, and automated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay employing an in-cell ELISA (icELISA) approach.\n\nAfter optimization of various parameters such as virus-specific antibodies, cell lines, virus doses, and duration of infection, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells became amenable as direct antigen source for quantitative icELISA. Using commercially available nucleocapsid protein-specific antibodies, viral infection could easily be quantified in human and highly permissive Vero E6 cells by icELISA. Antiviral agents such as human sera containing NAbs or antiviral interferons dose-dependently reduced the SARS-CoV-2-specific signal. Applying increased infectious doses, the icNT was superior to PRNT in discriminating convalescent sera with high from those with intermediate neutralizing capacities.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 icELISA test allows rapid (<48h in total, read-out in seconds) and automated quantification of virus infection in cell culture to evaluate the efficacy of NAbs as well as antiviral drugs, using reagents and equipment present in most routine diagnostics departments. We propose the icELISA and the icNT for COVID-19 research and diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lara Schoeler","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Vu Thuy Khanh Le-Trilling","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mareike Eilbrecht","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Denise Mennerich","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Olympia E.

The Spike (S) protein of the virus forms projections on the virion surface responsible for host cell attachment and penetration. This viral glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor in infected cells and, to be active, must be cleaved to two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2(3,4). For SARS-CoV-2 the cleavage is catalysed by furin, a host cell protease, which cleaves the S protein precursor at a specific sequence motif that generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg (RRAR) C-terminal sequence on S1. This sequence motif conforms to the C-end rule (CendR), which means that the C-terminal sequence may allow the protein to associate with cell surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors5. Here we demonstrate using immunoprecipitation, site-specific mutagenesis, structural modelling, and antibody blockade that, in addition to engaging the known receptor ACE2, S1 can bind to NRP1 through the canonical CendR mechanism. This interaction enhances infection by SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. NRP1 thus serves as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provides a therapeutic target for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James L Daly","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Boris Simonetti","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Carlos Anton Plagaro","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Maia Kavanagh Williamson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Deborah K Shoemark","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Lorena Simon-Gracia","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Katja Klein","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Michael Bauer","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Reka Hollandi","author_inst":"Biological Research Centre, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Urs F Greber","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Peter Horvath","author_inst":"Biological Research Centre,"},{"author_name":"Richard B Sessions","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Julian A Hiscox","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"David A Matthews","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Davidson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Peter J Cullen","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Yohei Yamauchi","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121301","rel_title":"Class I HLA allele restricted antigenic coverage for Spike and N proteins is associated with divergent outcomes for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121301","rel_abs":"The world is dealing with the worst pandemics ever.

The number of deaths per million inhabitants inversely correlated with the antigen coverage of peptides derived from viral protein S, while a direct correlation was observed for those derived from viral protein N, highlighting a potential risk group carrying HLAs associated with the latter. In addition, we identified 7 potential antigens bearing at least one amino acid of the small insertion that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from previous coronavirus strains.

We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the aggregation process of the spike receptor protein to ACE2 in long-time enhanced MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we find that the spike receptor protein does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates due to an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to the spike receptor domain, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2, so that the activation of the spike protein receptor might be inhibited in this case.

The virus crossed the species barrier and established in the human population taking advantage of the spike protein high affinity for the ACE receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. The Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) are highly immunogenic structural proteins and most commercial COVID-19 diagnostic assays target these proteins. In an unpredictable epidemic, it is essential to know about their genetic variability. The objective of this study was to describe the substitution frequency of the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in South America. A total of 504 amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from seven South American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, and Colombia), reported as of June 3, and corresponding to samples collected between March and April 2020, were compared through substitution matrices using the Muscle algorithm in MEGA X. Forty-three sequences from 13 Colombian departments were obtained in this study using the Oxford Nanopore and Illumina MiSeq technologies, following the amplicon-based ARTIC network protocol. The substitutions D614G in S and R203K\/G204R in N were the most frequent in South America, observed in 83% and 34% of the sequences respectively. Strikingly, genomes with the conserved position D614 were almost completely replaced by genomes with the G614 substitution between March to April, 2020. A similar replacement pattern was observed with R203K\/G204R although more marked in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, suggesting similar introduction history and\/or control strategies of SARS-CoV-2 in these countries.

We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human\/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/135004v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc6599org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1725a45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84a233org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b4c7aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christof C Smith","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah Entwistle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Caryn Willis","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Steven Vensko","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Beck","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jason Garness","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Maria Sambade","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Eric Routh","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kelly Olsen","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Julia Kodysh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carsten Haber","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Heiss","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Volker Stadler","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Erik Garrison","author_inst":"University of California - Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Oliver C Grant","author_inst":"University of Georgia - Athens"},{"author_name":"Robert Woods","author_inst":"University of Georgia - Athens"},{"author_name":"Mark Heise","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Benjamin G Vincent","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexander Rubinsteyn","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.131144","rel_title":"SARS-CoV2 Testing: The Limit of Detection Matters","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.131144","rel_abs":"Resolving the COVID-19 pandemic requires diagnostic testing to determine which individuals are infected and which are not. The current gold standard is to perform RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. Best-in-class assays demonstrate a limit of detection (LoD) of ~100 copies of viral RNA per milliliter of transport media. However, LoDs of currently approved assays vary over 10,000-fold. Assays with higher LoDs will miss more infected patients, resulting in more false negatives. However, the false-negative rate for a given LoD remains unknown. Here we address this question using over 27,500 test results for patients from across our healthcare network tested using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA. These results suggest that each 10-fold increase in LoD is expected to increase the false negative rate by 13%, missing an additional one in eight infected patients. The highest LoDs on the market will miss a majority of infected patients, with false negative rates as high as 70%. These results suggest that choice of assay has meaningful clinical and epidemiological consequences. The limit of detection matters.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramy Arnaout","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Rose Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ghee Rye Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Cody Callahan","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christina F Yen","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kenneth P Smith","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rohit Arora","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Kirby","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kelly Olsen","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Julia Kodysh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carsten Haber","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Heiss","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Volker Stadler","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Erik Garrison","author_inst":"University of California - Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Oliver C Grant","author_inst":"University of Georgia - Athens"},{"author_name":"Robert Woods","author_inst":"University of Georgia - Athens"},{"author_name":"Mark Heise","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Benjamin G Vincent","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexander Rubinsteyn","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.134379","rel_title":"The Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein restricts SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.134379","rel_abs":"Recent evidence shows that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly sensitive to interferons (IFNs).

Here, we show that Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) that specifically targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA sequences restricts SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that ZAP and its cofactors KHNYN and TRIM25 are expressed in human lung cells. Type I, II and III IFNs all strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and further induced ZAP expression. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives from bats show the strongest CpG suppression among all known human and bat coronaviruses, respectively. Nevertheless, knock-down of ZAP significantly increased SARS-CoV-2 production in lung cells, particularly upon treatment with IFN- or IFN-{gamma}.

Genetic variants which influence behavioural or immune responses to pathogens, selected for by pathogen pressure, may influence this variability. Two relevant polymorphisms in this context are the s allele of the serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) and the G allele of the interleukin-6 gene (IL-6 rs1800795). Methods: The frequencies of the 5-HTTLPR s allele and IL-6 rs1800795 G allele were obtained from published data. The correlations between these allele frequencies and the prevalence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were examined across 44 nations. Results: The IL-6 rs1800795 G allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence ({rho} = -0.466, p < 0.01) and mortality ({rho} = -0.591, p<0.001) across nations. The 5-HTTLPR s allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality rates ({rho} = -0.437, p = 0.023). Conclusions: These results suggest that a significant relationship exists between genetic variants that influence behavioural and immune responses to pathogens and indices of the impact of COVID-19 across nations. Further investigation of these variants and their correlates may permit the development of better preventive or therapeutic strategies in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ravi Philip Rajkumar","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Matsumura","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Kana Yamamoto","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Erika Yamashita","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Kazutaka Hosoda","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Tamae Hamaki","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Eiji Kusumi","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Saruchi Wadhwa","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishu Tyagi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saman Fatihi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Uma Sharma","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hemlata Lall","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Meena Datta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poonam Gupta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Saini","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aarti Tiwari","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bibhash Nandi","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra Kumar","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Satyabrata Bag","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanshi Deepanshi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Rathore","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Jatana","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Varun Jaiswal","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Simrita Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Singh","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manju Bala","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120923","rel_title":"Trajectories of depression and anxiety during enforced isolation due to COVID-19: longitudinal analyses of 59,318 adults in the UK with and without diagnosed mental illness","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120923","rel_abs":"Background: There is currently major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. A number of studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries prior to and during enforced isolation (lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims: This study explored trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced using data from England, and compared the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. Methods: Data from 36,520 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a well-stratified panel study weighted to population proportions collecting data weekly during the COVID-19 pandemic) were analysed from 23\/03\/2020-09\/08\/2020. Latent growth models were fitted accounting for socio-demographic and health covariates. Results: 22.6% of the sample had scores indicating moderate-severe anxiety, and 25.1% indicating moderate-severe depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in the England. The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period, with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced. Being female or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. Conclusions: As countries face potential future lockdowns, these data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety are in the early stages of lockdown but decline fairly rapidly as individuals adapt to circumstances. They also suggest the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to lockdown measures being brought in to try and reduce distress and highlight that emotionally vulnerable groups have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Feifei Bu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Erika Yamashita","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Kazutaka Hosoda","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Tamae Hamaki","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Eiji Kusumi","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Saruchi Wadhwa","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishu Tyagi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saman Fatihi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Uma Sharma","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hemlata Lall","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Meena Datta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poonam Gupta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Saini","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aarti Tiwari","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bibhash Nandi","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra Kumar","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Satyabrata Bag","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanshi Deepanshi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Rathore","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Jatana","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Varun Jaiswal","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Simrita Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Singh","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manju Bala","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120790","rel_title":"Assessing capacity to social distance and neighborhood-level health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120790","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded disproportionate impacts on communities of color in New York City (NYC). Researchers have noted that social disadvantage may result in limited capacity to socially distance, and consequent disparities. Here, we investigate the role of neighborhood social disadvantage on the ability to socially distance, infections, and mortality. We combine Census Bureau and NYC open data with SARS-CoV-2 testing data using supervised dimensionality-reduction with Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sums regression. The result is a ZIP code-level index with relative weights for social factors facilitating infection risk. We find a positive association between neighborhood social disadvantage and infections, adjusting for the number of tests administered. Neighborhood infection risk is also associated with capacity to socially isolate, as measured by NYC subway data. Finally, infection risk is associated with COVID-19-related mortality. These analyses support that differences in capacity to socially isolate is a credible pathway between disadvantage and COVID-19 disparities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Carrion","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Elena Colicino","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nicolo Foppa Pedretti","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Johnathan Rush","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kodi B.
