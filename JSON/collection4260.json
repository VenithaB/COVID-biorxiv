The necessity of keeping open and accessible public commercial establishments such as supermarkets or pharmacies increases during the pandemic provided that distancing rules and crowd control are satisfied. Herein, using agent-based models, we explore the potential spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 considering the case of a small size supermarket. For diverse distancing rules and number of simultaneous users (customers), we question flexible and limited movement policies, guiding the flow and interactions of users in place. Results indicate that a guided, limited in movement and well-organized policy combined with a distance rule of at least 1 m between users and a small number of them (15) may aid in the mitigation of potential new contagions in more than 90% compared to the usual policy of flexible movement with more users (30) which may reach up to 64% of mitigation of potential new infections under the same distancing conditions. This study may guide novel strategies for the mitigation of the current COVID-19 pandemic, at any stage, and prevention of future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gustavo Hernandez Mejia","author_inst":"Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies"},{"author_name":"Esteban A.

Assumptions about the presence and relative importance of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission are based on case reports, the failing of quarantine measures aimed at sequestering ill patients, viral dynamic studies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 production peaks before symptoms appear, and modeling evidence that calculates serial interval between successive generations of infection. In aggregate, these data offer compelling evidence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, but individually these studies have notable shortcomings that undermine their conclusions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, highlight limitations of recent studies, and propose experiments that, if conducted, would provide a more definitive analysis of the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed using search filters that relate to asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission as well as serial interval and viral dynamics. We focused on studies that provided primary clinical data. Results 34 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review: 11 case reports pertaining to asymptomatic transmission, 9 viral kinetic studies, 13 serial interval studies, and 1 study with viral kinetics and serial interval. Conclusion Different approaches to determining the presence and prevalence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission have notable shortcomings, which were highlighted in this review and limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions. Conducting high quality studies with the aim of understanding the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission is instrumental to developing the most informed policies on reopening our cities, states, and countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina Savvides","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Siegel","author_inst":"Stanford University Department Microbiology and Immunology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129221","rel_title":"Assessment of spread of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and concomitant serology in children in a region heavily affected by COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129221","rel_abs":"Background. Several studies indicated that children seem to be less frequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and potentially less contagious. To examine the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we combined both RT-PCR testing and serology in children in the most affected region in France, during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods. From April 14, 2020 to May 12, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional prospective, multicenter study. Healthy controls and pauci-symptomatic children from birth to age 15 years were enrolled by 27 ambulatory pediatricians. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and a microsample of blood for micro-method serology. Results. Among the 605 children, 322 (53.2%) were asymptomatic and 283 (46.8%) symptomatic. RT-PCR testing and serology were positive for 11 (1.8%) and 65 (10.7%) of all children, respectively. Only 3 children were RT-PCR-positive without any antibody response have been detected. The frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in children with positive serology than those with a negative one (12.3% vs 0.6%, p<0.001). Contact with a person with proven COVID-19 increased the odds of positivity on RT-PCR (OR 7.8, 95% confidence interval [1.5; 40.7]) and serology (15.1 [6.6; 34.6]). Conclusion. In area heavily affected by COVID-19, after the peak of the first epidemic wave and during the lockdown, the rate of children with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was very low (1.8%), but the rate of positive on serology was higher (10.7%). Most of PCR positive children had at the same time, positive serology suggesting a low risk of transmission.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Camille Jung","author_inst":"CRC CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Naim Ouldali","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Sellam","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Christophe Batard","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Cahn-Sellem","author_inst":"AFPA"},{"author_name":"Annie Elbez","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Alain Wollner","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Olivier Romain","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Francois Corrard","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Said Aberrane","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Soismier","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Rita Creidy","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Mounira Smati-Lafarge","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Odile Launay","author_inst":"Cochin hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Varon","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Corinne Levy","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20122762","rel_title":"Global research trend in the treatment of the new Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) : bibliometric analysis.","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20122762","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused worldwide concern and has become a major medical problem. Vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of this outbreak. This study aims to used bibliometric methods to identify research trends in the domain of therapeutics and vaccines to cure patients with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. The Web of Science Core Collection database was retrieved for articles on therapeutic approaches to coronavirus disease management published between January 1, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Identified and analyzed the data included title, corresponding author, language, publication time, publication type, research focus. A total of 1569 articles on coronavirus therapeutic means from 84 countries were published in 620 journals. We note the remarkable progressive increase in the number of publications related to research on therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. The United States provided the largest number of articles (405), followed by China (364). Journal of Medical Virology published most of them (n=40). 1005 (64.05%) were articles, 286 (18.23%) were letters, 230 (14.66%) were reviews. The terms \"COVID- 19\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\" or \"Coronavirus\" or \"hydroxychloroquine\" or \"chloroquine\" or \"2019-nCOV\" or \"ACE2\" or \"treatment\" or \"remdesivir\" or \"pneumonia\" were most frequently used, as shown in the density visualization map. A network analysis based on keyword co-occurrence revealed five distinct types of studies: clinical, biological, epidemiological, pandemic management, and therapeutics (vaccines and treatments). COVID-19 is a major disease that has had an impact on international public health at the global level. Several avenues for treatment and vaccines have been explored. Most of them focus on older drugs used to treat other diseases that have been effective for other types of coronaviruses. There is a discrepancy in the results obtained from the studies of the drugs included in this study. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate older drugs and develop new treatment options.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxime Descartes Mbogning Fonkou","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite"},{"author_name":"Abdourahamane YACOUBA","author_inst":"Universite Abdou Moumouni"},{"author_name":"Naim Ouldali","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Sellam","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Christophe Batard","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Cahn-Sellem","author_inst":"AFPA"},{"author_name":"Annie Elbez","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Alain Wollner","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Olivier Romain","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Francois Corrard","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Said Aberrane","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Soismier","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Rita Creidy","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Mounira Smati-Lafarge","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Odile Launay","author_inst":"Cochin hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Varon","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Corinne Levy","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129247","rel_title":"Multiplex Isothermal Amplification Coupled with Nanopore Sequencing for Rapid Detection and Mutation Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129247","rel_abs":"Molecular testing and surveillance of the spread and mutation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are critical public health measures to combat the pandemic.

Based on this, we developed NIRVANA (Nanopore sequencing of Isothermal Rapid Viral Amplification for Near real-time Analysis) to detect viral sequences and monitor mutations in multiple regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome for up to 96 patients at a time. NIRVANA uses a newly developed algorithm for on-the-fly data analysis during Nanopore sequencing. The whole workflow can be completed in as short as 3.5 hours, and all reactions can be done in a simple heating block.

Although the situation is rapidly evolving, with datasets being continually corrected or updated, it is crucial to understand what factors may be driving transmission through different populations. While studies are beginning to highlight specific parameters that may be playing a role, few have attempted to thoroughly estimate the relative importance of these disparate variables that likely include: climate, population demographics, and imposed state interventions. In this report, we compiled a database of more than 28 potentially explanatory variables for each of the 50 U.S. states through early May 2020. Using a combination of traditional statistical and modern machine learning approaches, we identified those variables that were the most statistically significant, and, those that were the most important. These variables were chosen to be fiduciaries of a range of possible drivers for COVID-19 deaths in the USA. We found that population-weighted density (PWD), some \"stay at home\" metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation, race\/ethnicity, and chronic low respiratory death rate, were all statistically significant. Of these, PWD and mobility metrics dominated. This suggests that the biggest impact on COVID-19 deaths was, at least initially, a function of where you lived, and not what you did. However, clearly, increasing social distancing has the net effect of (at least temporarily) reducing the effective PWD. Our results strongly support the idea that the loosening of \"lock-down\" orders should be tailored to the local PWD. In contrast to these variables, while still statistically significant, race\/ethnicity, health, and climate effects could only account for a few percent of the variability in deaths. Where associations were anticipated but were not found, we discuss how limitations in the parameters chosen may mask a contribution that might otherwise be present.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pete Riley","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Allison Riley","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"James Turtle","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Sara Mfarrej","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Fadwa S Alofi","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Asim Khogeer","author_inst":"Plan and Research Department, General Directorate of Health Affairs Makkah Region, MOH, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Anwar M Hashem","author_inst":"Vaccines and Immunotherapy Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Naif A.M.

Communicating the same scenario in different ways (framing) has been found to have a large impact on people's evaluations and behavior in the contexts of social behavior, risk taking and health care. We find that framing matters for people's assessment of the benefits of NPIs. In two commonly used frames, most subjects in our experiment drastically underestimate the number of cases NPIs avoid. Framing growth in terms of doubling times, rather than growth rates, reduces bias. When the scenario is framed in terms of time gained, rather than cases avoided, the median subject assesses the benefit of NPIs correctly. These findings suggest changes that public health authorities can adopt to better communicate the exponential spread of infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Schonger","author_inst":"ETH Zurich and HSLU"},{"author_name":"Daniela Sele","author_inst":"ETH-Bereich Hochschulen"},{"author_name":"James Turtle","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Sara Mfarrej","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Fadwa S Alofi","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Asim Khogeer","author_inst":"Plan and Research Department, General Directorate of Health Affairs Makkah Region, MOH, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Anwar M Hashem","author_inst":"Vaccines and Immunotherapy Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Naif A.M.

Here, we have identified distinct members of the family of polyether ionophore antibiotics with potent ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathogenicity in cells. Several compounds from this class displayed more than 100-fold selectivity between viral-induced cytopathogenicity and inhibition of cell viability, however the compound X-206 displayed >500-fold selectivity and was furthermore able to inhibit viral replication even at sub-nM levels. The antiviral mechanism of the polyether ionophores is currently not understood in detail. We demonstrate, through unbiased bioactivity profiling, that their effects on the host cells differ from those of cationic amphiphiles such as hydroxychloroquine. Collectively, our data suggest that polyether ionophore antibiotics should be subject to further investigations as potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esben B.

The viral spike, which mediates entry into cells by interacting with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is the primary target of most vaccines in development. These vaccines aim to elicit protective immunity against the glycoprotein by use of inactivated virus, vector-mediated delivery of the antigen in vivo, or by direct immunization with the purified antigen following expression in a heterologous system. These approaches are mostly dependent on the growth of mammalian or insect cells, which requires a sophisticated infrastructure that is not generally available in developing countries due to the incumbent costs which are prohibitive. Plant-based subunit vaccine production has long been considered as a cheaper alternative, although low expression yields and differences along the secretory pathway to mammalian cells have posed a challenge to producing certain viral glycoproteins. Recent advances that have enabled many of these constraints to be addressed include expressing the requisite human proteins in plants to support the maturation of the protein of interest. In this study we investigated these approaches to support the production of a soluble and putatively trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike mimetic in Nicotiana benthamiana via transient Agrobacterium-mediated expression. The co-expression of human calreticulin dramatically improved the accumulation of the viral spike, which was barely detectable in the absence of the co-expressed accessory protein. The viral antigen was efficiently processed even in the absence of co-expressed furin, suggesting that processing may have occurred at the secondary cleavage site and was mediated by an endogenous plant protease. In contrast, the spike was not efficiently processed when expressed in mammalian cells as a control, although the co-expression of furin improved processing considerably. This study demonstrates the feasibility of molecular engineering to improve the production of viral glycoproteins in plants, and supports plant-based production of SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines and reagents for serological assays.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emmanuel Aubrey Margolin","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Matthew Verbeek","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Ann Meyers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Rosamund Chapman","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Anna-Lise Williamson","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Edward Rybicki","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Ting Yuan","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Kanako Mori","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Axel Guzman Solis","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Masahiro Yamashita","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Lawrence J.

Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity. Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS, and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection. The vaccine is designed in silico by following a reverse vaccinology method acknowledging its antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity. The vaccine candidate that we have designed as a result of this work shows promising result indicating its potential capability of simulating an immune response.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muniba Faiza","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Review"},{"author_name":"Tariq Abdullah","author_inst":"IQL Technologies Pvt.

positive-sense RNA virus families within the Nidovirales order, which are further classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Coronaviruses have an extensive range of natural hosts and are known to be responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases in multiple species. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has unleashed a global threat to public health and the economy. Coronaviruses are extensively present in birds and mammals, with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), being the reservoir for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that seems to have resulted from a zoonotic spillover to the human host, causing respiratory infections, lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS). About six coronavirus serotypes are linked with the disease in humans, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh CoV to infect humans. We analyzed the genome sequence of CoV-2 from isolates derived from China as well from India and encountered minute variations in their sequence. A cladogram analysis revealed the predominant strain circulating in India belongs to the A2a clad. We took one such strain (MT012098) and performed a rigorous in-silico genotypic and antigenic analysis to identify its relatedness to other strains. Further, we also performed a detailed prediction for B and T cell epitopes using BepiPred 2.0 server and NetCTL 1.2 server (DTU Bioinformatics), respectively. We hope this information may assist in an effective vaccine designing program against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruby Dhar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Akhauri Yash Sinha","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Ashikh A Seethy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sri Anusha Matta","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Karthikeyan Pethusamy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Trymbak Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sunil Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Indrani Mukherjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sajib Sarkar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Minocha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kakali Purkayastha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Jai Bhagwan Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Paine","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Subhradip Karmakar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple all atom molecular dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanat Ali","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Ranjit Vijayan","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Ashikh A Seethy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sri Anusha Matta","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Karthikeyan Pethusamy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Trymbak Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sunil Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Indrani Mukherjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sajib Sarkar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Minocha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kakali Purkayastha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Jai Bhagwan Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Paine","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Subhradip Karmakar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

Methods: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. Results: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. Conclusion: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonia Johnson","author_inst":"NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit, Division of

early diagnosis of COVID-19 due to it gives both fast and accurate results. This is very important to help decision making of clinicians for quick isolation and appropriate patient treatment. In this study, we combine methods such as segmentation, data augmentation and the generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the effectiveness of learning models. We obtain the best performance with 99% accuracy for lung segmentation. Using the above improvements we get the highest rates in terms of accuracy (99.8%), precision (99.8%), recall (99.8%), f1-score (99.8%) and roc acu (99.9979%) with deep learning methods in this paper. Also we compare popular deep learning-based frameworks such as VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2 for automatic COVID-19 classification. The DenseNet169 amongst deep convolutional neural networks achieves the best performance with 99.8% accuracy. The second-best learner is InceptionResNetV2 with accuracy of 99.65\\%.

Some sera exhibited cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV (76.12%), MERS-CoV (17.91%), or both (10.45%). Interestingly, individuals recovered from severe disease (severe group) had nAbs with binding and neutralization titers higher than non-severe group. Severe group appeared a rapid increase of lymphocytes and a high proportion of circulating CXCR3+ Tfh cells. Interestingly, the later were spike-specific and positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 nAb titers. All subjects had no autoimmunity.

COVID-19 is a priority to maintain a safe and functioning healthcare system. The risk of transmitting COVID-19 to family members is a source of stress for many. Objective: To describe and compare HCW and non-HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, as well as the frequency of COVID-19 among HCWs household members. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario which captures all COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study comparing demographic, exposure, and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with COVID-19 as of 14 May 2020. We calculated rates of infections over time and determined the frequency of within household transmissions using natural language processing based on residential address. Exposures and Outcomes: We contrasted age, gender, comorbidities, clinical presentation (including asymptomatic and presymptomatic), exposure histories including nosocomial transmission, and clinical outcomes between HCWs and non-HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Results: There were 4,230 (17.5%) HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, of whom 20.2% were nurses, 2.3% were physicians, and the remaining 77.4% other specialties. HCWs were more likely to be between 30-60 years of age and female. HCWs were more likely to present asymptomatically (8.1% versus 7.0%, p=0.010) or with atypical symptoms (17.8% versus 10.5%, p<0.001). The mortality among HCWs was 0.2% compared to 10.5% of non-HCWs. HCWs commonly had exposures to a confirmed case or outbreak (74.1%), however only 3.1% were confirmed to be nosocomial. The rate of new infections was 5.5 times higher in HCWs than non-HCWs, but mirrored the epidemic curve. We identified 391 (9.8%) probable secondary household transmissions and 143 (3.6%) acquisitions. Children <19 years comprised 14.6% of secondary cases compared to only 4.2% of the primary cases. Conclusions and Relevance: HCWs represent a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario but with low confirmed numbers of nosocomial transmission. The data support substantial testing bias and under-ascertainment of general population cases. Protecting HCWs through appropriate personal protective equipment and physical distancing from colleagues is paramount.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin L

venous thromboembolism and there are multiple data regarding high incidence of venous thrombosis in critical COVID-19 patients, however reports on this complication in less severe patients are not widely available. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and to assess the prevalence of DVT with lung computerized tomography (lung CT) exams, clinical information and lab data. This study examined 75 consecutive patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, with specific exclusions. METHODS Almost all patients (pts) admitted to our hospital in the first half of May underwent comprehensive vein ultrasonography. 75 pts (aged 27-92 y, median - 63 y, 36 males and 39 females) with moderate to severe COVID-19 were included in our study. RESULTS Spontaneous echo contrast (decreased blood velocity and blood stasis) was detected in common femoral veins in 53 pts (70.7%). DVT was found in 15 pts (20%). The vast majority of those with DVT (13 pts, 86.7%) had thrombi only in calf veins and ileofemoral thrombosis was detected in 2 pts with DVT (13.3%). There was no significant observed difference between DVT and non-DVT patients with respect to age, underlying diseases, lung CT scores and SpaO2 at admission. There was also no significant observed difference between DVT and non-DVT patients with respect to both \"time from symptoms onset to admission\" and with respect to the majority of lab data. However, a significant difference was observed in D-dimer level (1.87 +\/- 1.62 vs 0.51 +\/- 0,4 mcg\/mL p<0.0001) and C-reactive protein (116.9 +\/- 83,6 and 65.1 +\/- 64.98 mg\/L, p = 0.014) for patients with DVT and patients without DVT respectably (Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the level of D-dimer >\/= 0.69 mcg\/mL is the predictor of DVT with a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of 77.6%, p < 0.001 (AUC area under curve = 0.7944). Logistic regression confirmed that D-dimer is an independent predictor of DVT and patients with D-dimer >\/= 0.69 mcg\/mL have odds ratio (OR) of developing DVT = 5.1 (confidence interval [CI] 1.9 - 13.5)). CONCLUSION Patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 show high incidence of DVT, indicating that moderate to severe COVID-19 patients may require an early administration of anticoagulation therapy as part of their treatment.

Based on this, we build a model including an additional compartment of infectious individuals who stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported serial interval, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. We find that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed so far, but has different implications for the future predictions in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures. Considering the role of modeling in important decisions such as easing lockdown measures and adjusting hospital capacity, we believe that it is critically important to consider a chronically infectious population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burcu Tepekule","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Anthony Hauser","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Viacheslav Nikolaevich Kachalov","author_inst":"University of Zurich, University Hospital of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sara Andresen","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Scheier","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Peter W.

infectious disease with a relatively large virus incubation period in the affected people who may be asymptomatic. Therefore, to reduce the transmission of this pathogen, several countries have taken many intervention measures. In this paper, we show that the impact of these measures in India is different from several other countries. It is shown that an early lockdown in late March 2020 changed the initial exponential growth curve of COVID-19 to a linear one, but a surge in the number of cases from late April 2020 brought India back to a quadratic trajectory. A regional analysis shows the disparate impact of the intervention in different states. It is further shown that the number of reported infections correlates with the number of tests, and therefore regions with limited diagnostics resources may not have a realistic estimate of the virus spread. This insufficiency of diagnostic test data is also reflected in an increasing positivity rate for India nearly 2.5 months after the lockdown, inconsistent with the trends observed for other geographical regions. Nonetheless, future projections are made using different epidemiological models based on the available data, and a comparative study is presented. In the absence of a reliable estimate of the true number of infections, these projections will have a limited accuracy: with that limitation, the most optimistic prediction suggests a continuing virus transmission through September 2020.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajesh Ranjan","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Anthony Hauser","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Viacheslav Nikolaevich Kachalov","author_inst":"University of Zurich, University Hospital of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sara Andresen","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Scheier","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Peter W.

with COVID-19 Mortality","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129825","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Introduction: Recent studies show cigarette smokers are markedly under-represented among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in over a dozen countries. It is unclear if this may be related to confounding factors such as age distribution, access to care, and inaccurate records. We hypothesized that these concerns could be avoided by studying smoking prevalence in relation to COVID-19 mortality. Since climate has been identified as a factor in COVID-19, we studied groups of countries with relatively comparable temperatures. Methods: The 20 hottest and 20 coldest countries in the Johns Hopkins Mortality Analysis database with a minimum mortality rate of .3 deaths\/100,000 were selected on the basis of the average temperatures of their largest city. Mortality rates were determined as of May 1, 2020 and correlated with national smoking rate adjusting for sex ratio, obesity, temperature, and elderly population. Results: A highly significant inverse correlation between current daily smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality rate was noted for the group of hot countries (R=-.718, p = .0002), cold countries (R=-.567, p=.0046), and the combined group (R=-.324, p=.0207). However, after adjustments only the regression for hot countries and the combined group remained significant. In hot countries, for each percentage point increase in smoking rate mortality decreased by .147 per 100,000 population (95% CI .102- 192, p=.0066). This resulted in mortality rates several-fold elevated in the countries with the lowest smoking rates relative to the highest smoking rates. In the combined group, mortality decreased by .257 per 100,000 population (95% CI .175-.339, p=.0034). Discussion: These findings add support to the finding of an inverse relationship between current smoking and seriously symptomatic COVID-19. However, we conclude that the difference in mortality between the highest and lowest smoking countries appears too large to be due primarily to the effects of smoking per se. A potentially beneficial effect of smoking is surprising, but compatible with a number of hypothetical mechanisms which deserve exploration: 1) Studies show smoking alters ACE2 expression which may affect COVID-19 infection or its progression to serious lung pathology. 2) Nicotine has anti-inflammatory activity and also appears to alter ACE2 expression. 3) Nitric oxide in cigarette smoke is known to be effective in treating pulmonary hypertension and has shown in vitro antiviral effects including against SARS-CoV-2. 4) Smoking has complicated effects on the immune system involving both up and down regulation, any of which might alone or in concert antagonize progression of COVID-19. 5) Smokers are exposed to hot vapors which may stimulate immunity in the respiratory tract by various heat-related mechanisms (e.g. heat shock proteins). Studies of steam and sauna treatments have shown efficacy in other viral respiratory conditions. At this time there is no clear evidence that smoking is protective against COVID-19, so the established recommendations to avoid smoking should be emphasized. The interaction of smoking and COVID-19 will only be reliably determined by carefully designed prospective study, and there is reason to believe that there are unknown confounds that may be spuriously suggesting a protective effect of smoking. However, the magnitude of the apparent inverse association of COVID-19 and smoking and its myriad clinical implications suggest the importance of further investigation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael J Norden","author_inst":"U of Washington (retired)"},{"author_name":"David H.

recent months, the entire world is facing a dramatic health emergency caused by the diffusion of a hitherto unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the efforts, the understanding of the many facets of the pandemic is still rather limited. In the present manuscript, we have monitored the evolution of the lethality rate in Italy by using the data collected over the last three months. Our data indicate that there is a striking correlation between the number of infected people of a certain week and the deaths of the following one. Despite the overall simplicity of the applied approach and its many approximations, the analysis of the Italian scenario provides some interesting insights into the pandemic. Indeed, we have found that the lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the last two months. This implies that the reduction of the deaths is strictly connected to the decrease of cases. Unfortunately, the present study does not support the idea that the virus potency has lowered in the last weeks, as our data demonstrate that the likelihood of a fatal outcome after the infection has not decreased in the recent outbreak evolution. Moreover, we show that the lethality rate is still very high in the country ({approx}13.5%). Since this number is remarkably higher if compared to the actual lethality estimates made worldwide, this finding suggests that the number of detected cases may be a gross underestimation of the actual infected people, likely due to the presence of a significant number of non-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals in the population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicole Balasco","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging - CNR"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo d'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Smaldone","author_inst":"IRCCS - SDN"},{"author_name":"Luigi Vitagliano","author_inst":"Italian National Research Council"},{"author_name":"Thomas Scheier","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Peter W.

Given that little immunity has developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact rates within and between populations carries substantial risks. Using a Bayesian epidemiological model, we estimate the leeway to reopen in a range of national and regional jurisdictions that have experienced different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimate the risks associated with different levels of reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We find widely varying leeway to reopen, high risks of exceeding past peak sizes, and high possible burdens per introduced case per week, up to hundreds in some jurisdictions. We recommend a cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong monitoring for changes in transmission.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean C.

Facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. We analyze the performance of a screening strategy proposed in Tuscany (Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. Methods. We simulate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity=0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. Results. Assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11167.6 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1. Costs and false negatives increase with the prevalence. Conclusions. The analyzed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low. The cost and effectiveness of the screening strategies should be evaluated in the actual context of the epidemic, accounting for the fact that it may change over time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michela Baccini","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Mattei","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Emilia Rocco","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giulia Vannucci","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Fabrizia Mealli","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Rebeca C.

The model reached an excellent fit to the data. I then simulated the post-confinement epidemic under several scenarios. The model shows that (in the absence of a vaccine) a second wave is likely inevitable and will arrive soon, and that a strategy of adaptive confinement may be effective to control it. The model also shows that just a few days delay in starting the confinement may have caused and excess of thousands of deaths in Spain.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisco de Castro","author_inst":"Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Mattei","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Emilia Rocco","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giulia Vannucci","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Fabrizia Mealli","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Rebeca C.

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases exceeded 3 million worldwide and 1 million in the US with an estimated fatality rate of more than 7 percent. Because the patterns of the occurrence of new confirmed cases and deaths over time are complex and seemingly country-specific, estimating the long-term pandemic spread is challenging. I developed a simple transformation algorithm to investigate the characteristics of the case and death time series per nation, and described the universal similarities observed in the transformed time series of 19 nations in the Group of Twenty (G20). To investigate the universal similarities among the cumulative profiles of confirmed cases and deaths of 19 individual nations in the G20, a transformation algorithm of the time series data sets was developed with open-source software programs. The algorithm was used to extract and analyze statistical information from daily updated COVID-19 pandemic data sets from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Two new parameters for each nation were suggested as factors for time-shifting and time-scaling to define reduced time, which was used to quantify the degree of universal similarities among nations. After the cumulative confirmed case and death profiles of a nation were transformed by using reduced time, most of the 19 nations, with few exceptions, had transformed profiles that closely converged to those of Italy after the onset of cases and deaths. The initial profiles of the cumulative confirmed cases per nation universally showed 3 - 4 week latency periods, during which the total number of cases remained at approximately ten. The latency period of the cumulative number of deaths was approximately half the latency number of cumulative cases, and subsequent uncontrollable increases in human deaths seemed unavoidable because the coronavirus had already widely spread. Immediate governmental actions, including responsive public-health policy-making and enforcement, are observed to be critical to minimize (and possibly stop) further infections and subsequent deaths. In the pandemic spread of infectious viral diseases, such as COVID-19 studied in this work, different nations show dissimilar and seemingly uncorrelated time series profiles of infected cases and deaths. After these statistical phenomena were viewed as identical events occurring at a distinct rate in each country, the reported algorithm of the data transformation using the reduced time revealed a nation-independent, universal profile (especially initial periods of the pandemic spread) from which a nation-specific, predictive estimation could be made and used to assist in immediate public-health policy-making.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert S Kim","author_inst":"University of Hawaii at Manoa"},{"author_name":"Siegfried Burggraf","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Czibere","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Tobias Fleige","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Michael Spannagl","author_inst":"Haemophilia Treatment Centre, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich"},{"author_name":"David Watts","author_inst":"School of Medical Sciences and Photon Science Institute, University of Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Marc Becker","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Naveed Z.

containment of the disease and breaks in the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The present situation demands countries to scale up their testing and design innovative strategies to conserve diagnostic kits and reagents. The pooling of samples saves time, manpower, and most importantly diagnostic kits and reagents. In the present study, we tried to define the pool size that could be applied with acceptable confidence for testing. Material and methods- We used repeatedly tested positive clinical sample elutes having different levels of SARS CoV 2 RNA and negative sample elutes to prepare seven series of 11 pools each, having pool sizes ranging from 2 to 48 samples to estimate the optimal pool size. Each pool had one positive sample elute in different compositions. All the pools were tested by SARS CoV 2 RT-qPCR. Results- Out of the 77 pools, only 53 (68.8%) were found positive. The sensitivity of pools of 2 to 48 samples was decreased from 100% (95% CL; 98.4-100) to 41.41% (95% CL; 34.9-48.1). The maximum size of the pool with acceptable sensitivity (>95%) was found to be of 6 samples. For the pool size of 6 samples, the sensitivity was 97.8% and the efficiency of pooling was 0.38. Conclusion- The pooling of samples is a practical way for scaling up testing and ultimately containing the further spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ARVIND KHODARE","author_inst":"INSTITUTE OF LIVER AND BILIARY SCIENCES"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Padhi","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ekta Gupta","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reshu Agarwal","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Dubey","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar Sarin","author_inst":"INSTITUTE OF LIVER AND BILIARY SCIENCES"},{"author_name":"Marc Becker","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Naveed Z.
