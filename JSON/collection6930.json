Pakistani strain MT240479 (Gilgit1-Pak) was found in close proximity to MT184913 (CruiseA-USA), while the second Pakistani strain MT262993 (Manga-Pak) was neighboring to MT039887 (WI-USA) strain in the constructed cladogram in this article. Afterward, four whole genome SARS-nCoV2 strain sequences were taken for variant calling analysis, those who appeared nearest relative in the earlier cladogram constructed a week time ago. Among those two Pakistani strains each of 29,836 bases were compared against MT263429 from (WI-USA) of 29,889 bases and MT259229 (Wuhan-China) of 29,864 bases. We identified 31 variants in both Pakistani strains, (Manga-Pak vs USA=2del+7SNPs, Manga-Pak vs Chinese=2del+2SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs USA=10SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs Chinese=8SNPs), which caused alteration in ORF1ab, ORF1a and N genes with having functions of viral replication and translation, host innate immunity and viral capsid formation respectively. These novel variants are assumed to be liable for low mortality rate in Pakistan with 385 as compared to USA with 63,871 and China with 4,633 deaths by May 01, 2020. However functional effects of these variants need further confirmatory studies. Moreover, mutated N & ORF1a proteins in Pakistani strains were also analyzed by 3D structure modelling, which give another dimension of comparing these alterations at amino acid level. In a nutshell, these novel variants are assumed to be linked with reduced mortality of COVID-19 in Pakistan along with other influencing factors, these novel variants would also be useful to understand the virulence of this virus and to develop indigenous vaccines and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rashid Saif","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Tania Mahmood","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Aniqa Ejaz","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saeeda Zia","author_inst":"National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Abdul Rasheed Qureshi","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Chest Hospital, Ferozpure Road, Lahore, Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.072330","rel_title":"Rampant C->U hypermutation in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses - causes and consequences for their short and long evolutionary trajectories","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.072330","rel_abs":"The pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread. To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a dataset of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, commensurate with a mid-range coronavirus substitution rate of 3x10-4 substitutions\/site\/year. Almost half of sequence changes were C->U transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between C->U and U->C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C->U transitions underpinned almost half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants, and occurred preferentially in both 5U\/A and 3U\/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses (U>>A>G>>C) and low G+C contents may represent long term effects of prolonged C->U hypermutation in their hosts.\n\nImportanceThe evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short and long term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favoured mutational hotspots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represents a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks that are typically used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3SY, UK."},{"author_name":"Tania Mahmood","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Aniqa Ejaz","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Educational Complex, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saeeda Zia","author_inst":"National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Abdul Rasheed Qureshi","author_inst":"Gulab Devi Chest Hospital, Ferozpure Road, Lahore, Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083055","rel_title":"A comparison of health care worker-collected foam and polyester nasal swabs in convalescent COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083055","rel_abs":"Background: The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases and testing has created supply shortages at various points in the testing workflow. As of April 15, 2020 FDA recommendations only allowed for the use of nasopharyngeal, flocked mid turbinate, or foam nasal swabs, all of which are in very low supply. Polyester swabs are more readily available and mass producible. We compare the performance of polyester and foam swabs stored in different transport media. Methods: Both polyester and foam nasal swabs were collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients at a single visit. Using the foam nasal swabs as the comparator, sensitivity of the polyester swabs in each media were calculated, three by three tables were constructed to measure concordance, and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. Findings: 126 visits had polyester and foam swabs stored in viral transport media (VTM), 51 had polyester and foam swabs stored in saline, and 63 had a foam swab in VTM and a polyester swab stored in a dry tube. Using nasal foam swabs as a comparator, polyester nasal swabs had a sensitivity of 86*5% when both samples were stored in VTM, 86*7% when both samples were stored in saline, and 72*4% when the polyester swab was stored dry and the foam swab was stored in VTM. Polyester and foam Ct values from the same visit were correlated, but polyester swabs showed decreased performance for cases with a viral load near the detection threshold and higher Ct values on average. Interpretation: Polyester nasal swabs showed a reduction in performance from foam nasal swabs, but may still provide a viable sample collection method given the current supply shortages and public health emergency.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian Hart","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Po Tu","author_inst":"The Everett Clinic"},{"author_name":"Rachel Jennings","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Prateek Verma","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Leah Padgett","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Douglas Rains","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Ethan Berke","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082917","rel_title":"Tuberculosis and COVID-19 in 2020: lessons from the past viral outbreaks and possible future outcomes","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082917","rel_abs":"Background. The threat of contagious infectious diseases is constantly evolving, as demographic explosion, travel globalization and changes in human lifestyle increase the risk of spreading pathogens, leading to accelerated changes in disease landscape. Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results. PubMed electronic database was requested for relevant articles linking TB, influenza and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (with a focus on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from the past outbreaks (other coronaviruses), as well as influenza pandemic \/ seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions. Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their harmful synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Radu Crisan-Dabija","author_inst":"University of Medicine and Pharmacy \"Grigore T.

Post-mortem analyses revealed diffuse alveolar damage in both the acute and organizing phases, with a predominantly CD68+ inflammatory infiltrate. Serum was positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, suggesting that viral infection predated administration of ICI-therapy and may have contributed to a more fulminant clinical presentation.

Initially, we intended to create and validate an ML software solution able to discriminate on the basis of the CXR between SARS-CoV-2-induced bronchopneumonia and other bronchopneumonia etiologies. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and arXiv databases using the following search terms [\"artificial intelligence\" OR \"deep learning\" OR \"neural networks\"], AND [\"COVID-19\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\"] AND [\"chest X-ray\" OR \"CXR\" OR \"X-ray\"] found 14 recent studies. Most of them declared to be able to confidently identify COVID-19 based on CXRs using deep neural networks. Firstly, weaknesses of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions were analyzed, tackling the issues with datasets (from both medical and technical points of view) and the vulnerability of used algorithms. Then, arguments were provided for why our study design is stronger and more realistic than the previously quoted papers, balancing the possible false expectations with facts. The authors consider that the potential of AI use in COVID-19 diagnosis on CXR is real. However, scientific community should be careful in interpreting statements, results and conclusions regarding AI use in imaging. It is therefore necessary to adopt standards for research and publication of data, because it seems that in the recent months scientific reality suffered manipulations and distortions. Also, a call for responsible approaches to the imaging methods in COVID-19 is raised. It seems mandatory to follow some rigorous approaches in order to provide with adequate results in daily routine. In addition, the authors intended to raise public awareness about the quality of AI protocols and algorithms and to encourage public sharing of as many CXR images with common quality standards.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandru Burlacu","author_inst":"Head of Department of Interventional Cardiology - Cardiovascular Diseases Institute, and \"Grigore T.

Methods: In this retrospective single center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID 19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death . Results: 212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe CONUT group than in the moderate, mild , and normal CONUT groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95%CI (1.124 10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI(0.581 0.896),P=0.003) were independent predictors of all cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95% CI(2.147 273.327), p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81%; AUC 0.753; 95% CI(0.644 0.862);respectively).The PNI cutoff value was 40.58 (81.80 and 66.20%; AUC 0.778; 95% CI(0.686 0.809); respectively).We use PNI and the COUNT score to assess malnutrition, which can have a prognosis effect of COVID 19 patients.

Drastic measures of social distancing are enforced in society and healthcare systems are being pushed to and over their limits. Objectives : To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 by applying AI to chest CT and evaluate validation performance. Methods : In this retrospective multi-site study, a fully automated AI framework was developed to extract radiomics features from volumetric chest CT exams to learn the detection pattern of COVID-19 patients. We analysed the data from 181 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as 1200 other non-COVID-19 control patients to build and assess the performance of the model. The datasets were collected from 2 different hospital sites of the CHU Liege, Belgium. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results : 1381 patients were included in this study. The average age was 64.4 and 63.8 years with a gender balance of 56% and 52% male in the COVID-19 and control group, respectively. The final curated dataset used for model construction and validation consisted of chest CT scans of 892 patients. The model sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the test set (training 80% and test 20% of patients) were 78.94% and 91.09%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.9398 (95% CI: 0.875-1). The negative predictive value of the algorithm was found to be larger than 97%. Conclusions : Benchmarked against RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19, our AI framework can accurately differentiate COVID-19 from routine clinical conditions in a fully automated fashion. Thus, providing rapid accurate diagnosis in patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, facilitating the timely implementation of isolation procedures and early intervention.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julien Guiot","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Akshayaa Vaidyanathan","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium, The D-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, GROW School for Oncology, Maastricht University, "},{"author_name":"Louis Deprez","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Fadila Zerka","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium, The D-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, GROW School for Oncology, Maastricht University, "},{"author_name":"Denis Danthine","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Anne-Noelle Frix","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marie Thys","author_inst":"Department of Medico-Economic Information, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Monique Henket","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Gregory Canivet","author_inst":"Department of Computer Applications, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stephane Mathieu","author_inst":"Department of Computer Applications, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Eva Eftaxia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lambin","author_inst":"The D-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine, GROW School for Oncology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Nathan Tsoutzidis","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Miraglio","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sean Walsh","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Michel Moutschen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium Michel"},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20085910","rel_title":"Validation of an extraction-free RT-PCR protocol for detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20085910","rel_abs":"In light of supply chain failures for reagents and consumables needed for purification of nucleic acid for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR, we aim to verify the performance and utility of a non-extraction protocol for RT-PCR (\"direct RT-PCR\").

We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from commercial suppliers. Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures. Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform. VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least four months at room temperature.

The anticoagulant actions of nebulised heparin limit fibrin deposition and progression of lung injury. Serendipitously, unfractionated heparin also inactivates the SARS CoV 2 virus and prevents its entry into mammalian cells. Nebulisation of heparin may therefore limit both fibrin mediated lung injury and inhibit pulmonary infection by SARS CoV 2. For these reasons we have initiated a multicentre international trial of nebulised heparin in patients with COVID 19. Methods and intervention: Mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed or strongly suspected SARS CoV 2 infection, hypoxaemia and an acute pulmonary opacity in at least one lung quadrant on chest Xray, will be randomised to nebulised heparin 25,000 Units every 6 hours or standard care for up to 10 days while mechanically ventilated. The primary outcome is the time to separation from invasive ventilation to day 28, where non survivors to day 28 are treated as though not separated from invasive ventilation. Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol has been submitted to the human research and ethics committee of St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Submission is pending in other jurisdictions.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with serious threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed to review the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. Also, we focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear to not have higher risks of infection and worse outcome in COVID-19 than the general population, in attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods. PubMed electronic database was interogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L alternate receptor and phosphorylated  subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny including \"cytokine storm\" prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, viral endocytosis inhibition. Conclusions. Using current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Iolanda Valentina Popa","author_inst":"Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Iasi, Romania and 'Grigore T.

Nearly ten percent of reported coronavirus infections in Italy occurred in healthcare workers. This study aimed to understand physicians access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and to information about their use, risk perception and strategies adopted to prevent contracting the infection. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional, online self-reported survey implemented between March 31 and April 5 2020 of Italian physicians. Results Responses were received from 529 physicians, only 13% of which reported to have access to PPE every time they need them. Approximately half of the physicians reported that the information received about the use of PPE was either clear (47%) or complete (54%). Risk perception about contracting the infection was influenced by receiving adequate information on the use of PPE. Access to adequate information on the use of PPE was associated with better ability to perform donning and doffing procedures [OR=2.2 95% C.I. 1.7-2.8] and reduced perception of risk [OR=0.5, 95% C.I. 0.4-0.6]. Conclusions Results from this rapid survey indicate that while ramping up supplies on PPE for healthcare workers is certainly of mandatory importance, adequate training and clear instructions are just as important.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elena Savoia","author_inst":"Emergency Preparedness Research, Evaluation, & Practice (EPREP) program, Division of Policy Translation & Leadership Development, Harvard T.H.

The population weight adjusted estimate was 0.21 (95%CI: 0.14-0.29) and test performance adjusted prevalence was 0.33 (95%CI: 0.28-0.39). Based on these estimates the range of infected people in this province would be between 518000 and 777000. Conclusion: The population seropositivity prevalence of COVID-19 virus infection indicated that the asymptomatic infection is much higher than the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. This estimate can be used to better detect infection fatality rate and decide for public policy guidelines.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Shakiba","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyed Saeed Hashemi Nazari","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Fardin Mehrabian","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyed Mahmoud Rezvani","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Zahra Ghasempour","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Abtin Heidarzadeh","author_inst":"Guilan university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Jose-Manuel Vaquero","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"Doris Folini","author_inst":"Institute for Atmosphere and Climate (IAC), ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Manuel Anton","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078709","rel_title":"Extensive testing may reduce COVID-19 mortality: a lesson from northern Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078709","rel_abs":"We examined data on the progression of COVID-19 epidemics in four regions in northern Italy.

Since we observed clinical and histopathological similarities between COVID-19 and lung manifestations of connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD) in our clinical practice, aim of the present study is to analyze a possible role of autoimmunity in SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Methods: In this prospective, single-center trial, we enrolled 22 consecutive patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in March and April, 2020. We performed high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and full laboratory testing including autoantibody (AAB) screening (anti-ANA, SS-B\/La, Scl-70, Jo-1, CENP-B, PM-Scl). Transbronchial biopsies as well as post mortem tissue samples were obtained from 3 and 2 cases, respectively, and subsequent histopathologic analysis with special emphasis on characterization of interstitial lung disease was performed. Results: Twelve of 22 patients (54.5%) were male and median age was 69.0 (range: 28-88). 11 (50.0%) patients had to be undergo intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Intubation with ventilation was required in 10\/22 cases (46%). Median follow-up was 26 days. Clinical and serological parameters were comparable to previous reports. Radiological and histopathological findings were highly heterogeneous including patterns reminiscent of CTD-ILD. AAB titers [&ge;]1:100 were detected in 10\/11 (91.9%) COVID-19 patients who required ICU treatment, but in 4\/11 (36.4%) patients with mild clinical course (p=0.024). Patients with AABs tended to require invasive ventilation and showed significantly more severe complications (64.3% vs. 12.5%, p=0.031). Overall COVID-19-related mortality was 18.2% among hospitalized patients at our institution. Conclusion: Our findings point out serological, radiological and histomorphological similarities between COVID-19-associated ARDS and acute exacerbation of CTD-ILD. While the exact mechanism is still unknown, we postulate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might trigger or simulate a form of organ-specific autoimmunity in predisposed patients. The detection of autoantibodies might identify patients who profit from immunosuppressive therapy to prevent the development of respiratory failure.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Gagiannis","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Julie Steinestel","author_inst":"Clinic of Urology, University Hospital Augsburg"},{"author_name":"Carsten Hackenbroch","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Michael Hannemann","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Vincent G Umathum","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Niklas Gebauer","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcel Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Hanno M Witte","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Konrad Steinestel","author_inst":"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20078329","rel_title":"Population-scale testing can suppress the spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20078329","rel_abs":"We propose an additional intervention that would contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, offer more protection for people working in essential jobs, and help guide an eventual reopening of society. The intervention is based on: (1) testing every individual (2) repeatedly, and (3) isolation of infected individuals. We show here that at a sufficient rate of testing and isolation, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. The approach does not rely on strong and\/or unrealistic assumptions about test accuracy, compliance to isolation, population structure or epidemiological parameters, and its success can be monitored in real time by measuring the change of the test positivity rate over time. In addition to the rate of compliance and false negatives, the required rate of testing is dependent on the design of the testing regime, with concurrent testing outperforming random sampling of individuals. Provided that results are reported rapidly, the test frequency required to suppress an epidemic is linear with respect to R0, to the infectious period, and to the fraction of susceptible individuals. Importantly, the testing regime would be effective at any level of prevalence, and additive to other interventions such as contact tracing and social distancing. It would also be robust to failure, as even in the case where the testing rate would be insufficient to collapse the epidemic, it would still reduce the number of infected individuals in the population, improving both public health and economic conditions. A mass-produced, disposable antigen or RNA test that could be used at home would be ideal, due to the optimal performance of concurrent tests that return immediate results.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jussi Taipale","author_inst":"University  of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Paul Romer","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Sten Linnarsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael Hannemann","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Vincent G Umathum","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Niklas Gebauer","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcel Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Hanno M Witte","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Konrad Steinestel","author_inst":"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078717","rel_title":"Full lockdown policies in Western Europe countries have no evident impacts on the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078717","rel_abs":"This phenomenological study assesses the impacts of full lockdown strategies applied in Italy, France, Spain and United Kingdom, on the slowdown of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak.

RESULTS: The projected total death toll will be 261680 (392520 to 183176) which represents the 0.003 % of world population. This number amounts to 0.054 deaths per 1000, while the mean in the world (all causes) is 7.7. The daily peak of deaths (7270 (+\/-500)) happened the 15 (+\/- 3) of April, meaning that we are in descending curve of the pandemic. The outbreak will end completely the 23th (+\/-3) of June. However, already on 9th (+\/- 3) of May, 2 sigma; (95.45%) of the deaths will have be occured. The projected death toll is much lower (5-10 times) than those forecasted by the Imperial College Group (ICG) even considering the best scenario of total suppression of virus transmission. Using actual mortality rates it is possible to back calculate which number of infected individuals would produce such mortality. The death toll arises from a number of infected individuals between 53 (worst case) and 3.3 million. The calculated number of infected individuals is significantly lower than that calculated by ICG (227.5 millions) with suppression.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"cesar| a barbero","author_inst":"IITEMA-UNRC"},{"author_name":"Paul Romer","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Sten Linnarsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael Hannemann","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Vincent G Umathum","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Niklas Gebauer","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcel Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Hanno M Witte","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Konrad Steinestel","author_inst":"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20078618","rel_title":"Nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic COVID-19: A cross-sectional investigation of US general public beliefs, attitudes, and actions","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20078618","rel_abs":"Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) represent the primary mitigation strategy for pandemic COVID-19. Despite this, many government agencies and members of the general public may be resistant to NPI adoption. We sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs regarding various NPIs and self-reported adoption of NPIs, and explore associations between NPI performance and the baseline characteristics of respondents. We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and with a belief that the NPIs were not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p<0.0001). Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility, as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bella Nichole Kantor","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kantor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sten Linnarsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael Hannemann","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Vincent G Umathum","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Niklas Gebauer","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcel Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Hanno M Witte","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Oncology, Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"Konrad Steinestel","author_inst":"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20079756","rel_title":"Racial, Economic and Health Inequality and COVID-19 Infection in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20079756","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: There is preliminary evidence of racial and social-economic disparities in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health and economic inequality in the United States. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population: 102,178,117 [median: 73,447, IQR: 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts). Findings: The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1,981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing. Interpretation: The observed inequality might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care.

Using a transmission model, we examined how serology can be implemented to allow seropositive individuals to resume more normal levels of social interaction while offsetting the risks. We simulated the use of widespread serological testing with realistic assay characteristics, in which seropositive individuals partially restore their social contacts and act as immunological shields. If social distancing is relaxed by 50% at the same time that quarterly serological screening is initiated, approximately 120,000 deaths could be averted and a quarter of the US population could be released from social distancing in the first year of the epidemic, compared to a scenario without serological testing. This strategy has the potential to substantially flatten the COVID-19 epidemic curve while also allowing a substantial number of individuals to safely return to social and economic interactions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alicia Nicole Mullis Kraay","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kristin Nelson","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Conan Zhao","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Lopman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Shima Shahjouei","author_inst":"Geisinger Health System"},{"author_name":"Jiang Li","author_inst":"Geisinger Health System"},{"author_name":"Ramin Zand","author_inst":"Geisinger Health System"},{"author_name":"Konrad Steinestel","author_inst":"Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm"},{"author_name":"John Moran","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, South Australia."},{"author_name":"Frank Van Haren","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Canberra Hospital, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gordon Doig","author_inst":"Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sachin Gupta","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Angajendra Ghosh","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simone Said","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Santamaria","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"author_name":"Renaud Louis","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Paul Meunier","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Vos","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ralph Leijenaar","author_inst":"Oncoradiomics SA, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Lovinfosse","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Medicine and Oncological Imaging, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081836","rel_title":"Social Distancing Has Merely Stabilized COVID-19 in the US","rel_date":"2020-04-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081836","rel_abs":"Social distancing measures, with varying degrees of restriction, have been imposed around the world in order to stem the spread of COVID-19.

We find that social distancing is associated with a statistically-significant reduction in the doubling rate for all but three states. At the same time, we do not find significant evidence that social distancing has resulted in a reduction in the number of daily confirmed cases. Instead, social distancing has merely stabilized the spread of the disease.

This has necessitated the exploration of alternative diagnostic options to alleviate supply chain issues.\n\nAimTo establish and validate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\nMethodologyWe used a commercial RT-LAMP mastermix from OptiGene Ltd in combination with a primer set designed to detect the CDC N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene. A single-tube, single-step fluorescence assay was implemented whereby as little as 1 L of universal transport medium (UTM) directly from a nasopharyngeal swab could be used as template, bypassing the requirement for RNA purification. Amplification and detection could be conducted in any thermocycler capable of holding 65{degrees}C for 30 minutes and measure fluorescence in the FAM channel at one-minute intervals.\n\nResultsAssay evaluation by assessment of 157 clinical specimens previously screened by E-gene RT-qPCR revealed assay sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 100%, respectively. Results were fast, with an average time-to-positive (Tp) for 93 clinical samples of 14 minutes (SD {+\/-}7 minutes). Using dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into UTM, we also evaluated assay performance against FDA guidelines for implementation of emergency-use diagnostics and established a limit-of-detection of 54 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 per ml (TCID50 mL-1), with satisfactory assay sensitivity and specificity. A comparison of 20 clinical specimens between four laboratories showed excellent interlaboratory concordance; performing equally well on three different, commonly used thermocyclers, pointing to the robustness of the assay.\n\nConclusionWith a simplified workflow, N1-STOP-LAMP is a powerful, scalable option for specific and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and an additional resource in the diagnostic armamentarium against COVID-19.\n\n3.

Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions. The current study examined these factors in 2,174 Australian residents. An online survey was completed between 2-9 March 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in Australia (which subsequently occurred). Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents' expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with engagement with health-protective behaviours. These findings offer potential pathways for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate Faasse","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Jill M Newby","author_inst":"UNSW"},{"author_name":"Julie L.

The feasibility of rapid clinical-grade manufacturing of virus-specific T cells from convalescent donors has not been demonstrated for this or prior pandemics. Methods One unit of whole blood was collected from each convalescent donor following standard blood bank practices. After the plasma was separated and stored separately, the leukocytes were stimulated using overlapping peptides of SARS-CoV-2, covering the immunodominant sequence domains of the S protein and the complete sequence of the N and M proteins. Thereafter, functionally reactive cells were enriched overnight using an automated device capturing IFN{gamma}-secreting cells. Findings From 1x10[9] leukocytes, 0.56 to 1.16x10[6] IFN{gamma}+ T cells were produced from each of the first two donors. Most of the T cells (64% to 71%) were IFN{gamma}+, with preferential enrichment of CD56+ T cells, effector memory T cells, and effector memory RA+ T cells. TCRV{beta} spectratyping revealed oligoclonal distribution, with over-representation of subfamilies including V{beta}3, V{beta}16 and V{beta}17. With just two donors, the probability that a recipient in the same ethnic group would share at least one donor HLA allele or one haplotype could be as high as >90% and >30%, respectively. Interpretations This study is limited by small number of donors and absence of recipient data; however, crucial first proof-of-principle data are provided demonstrating the feasibility of clinical-grade production of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for urgent clinical use, conceivably with plasma therapy concurrently. Our data showing that virus-specific T cells can be detected easily after brief stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides suggest that a parallel diagnostic assay can be developed alongside serology testing.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wing Leung","author_inst":"KKH, SingHealth Duke-NUS"},{"author_name":"Teck Guan Soh","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yeh Ching Linn","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek-Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiashen Loh","author_inst":"Sengkang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marieta Chan","author_inst":"Health Sciences Authority"},{"author_name":"Wee Joo Chng","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liang Piu Koh","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Li-Mei Poon","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"King Pan Ng","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Chik Hong Kuick","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Thuan Tong Tan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lip Kun Tan","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michaela Su-fern Seng","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan L.
