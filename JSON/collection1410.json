Among these, antibodies and vaccines are particularly attractive because of their high specificity, low probability of drug-drug interaction, and potentially long-standing protective effects. While the threat at hand justifies the pace of research, the implementation of therapeutic strategies cannot be exempted from safety considerations. There are several potential adverse events reported after the vaccination or antibody therapy, but two are of utmost importance: antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, the depletion or exhaustion of T-cells has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This observation suggests a potential role of vaccines eliciting cellular immunity, which might simultaneously limit the risk of ADE and CSS. Such risk was proposed to be associated with FcR-induced activation of proinflammatory macrophages (M1) by Fu et al. 2020 and Iwasaki et al. 2020. All aspects of the newly developed vaccine (including the route of administration, delivery system, and adjuvant selection) may affect its effectiveness and safety. In this work we use a novel in silico approach (based on AI and bioinformatics methods) developed to support the design of epitope-based vaccines. We evaluated the capabilities of our method for predicting the immunogenicity of epitopes. Next, the results of our approach were compared with other vaccine-design strategies reported in the literature. The risk of immuno-toxicity was also assessed. The analysis of epitope conservation among other Coronaviridae was carried out in order to facilitate the selection of peptides shared across different SARS-CoV-2 strains and which might be conserved in emerging zootic coronavirus strains. Finally, the potential applicability of the selected epitopes for the development of a vaccine eliciting cellular immunity for COVID-19 was discussed, highlighting the benefits and challenges of such an approach.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni Mazzocco","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Iga Niemiec","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Alexander Myronov","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland; Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Piotr Skoczylas","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Jan Kaczmarczyk","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Anna Sanecka-Duin","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Gruba","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland; Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Paulina Kr\u00f3l","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Micha\u0142 Drwal","author_inst":"Ardigen, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marian Szczepanik","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Pyr\u0107","author_inst":"Virogenetics Laboratory of Virology, Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Piotr St\u0119pniak","author_inst":"Ardigen"},{"author_name":"Alex Espinosa","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Wesley Wu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"- CLIAHUB Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Debra A Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andreas Puschnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Norma Neff","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Vida Ahyong","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Steve Miller","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ayscue","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Tato","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Simon Paul","author_inst":"Madera County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Emily Dawn Crawford","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.267724","rel_title":"Epitopes targeted by T cells in convalescent COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.267724","rel_abs":"There is growing evidence pointing to the protective role of T cells against COVID-19.

We developed a cell line with inducible ACE2 expression to confirm that D614G more efficiently enters cells with ACE2 levels spanning the different primary cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Using a new assay for crosslinking and directly extracting Spike trimers from the pseudovirus surface, we found an increase in trimerization efficiency and viral incorporation of D614G protomers. Our findings suggest that D614G increases infection of cells expressing a wide range of ACE2, and informs the mechanism underlying enhanced entry.

Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site ({Delta}PRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the {Delta}PRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the {Delta}PRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT50 titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2 assays.\n\nImportanceAs COVID-19 has impacted the world, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and causes virulence offers potential pathways to disrupt its disease. By removing the furin cleavage site, we demonstrate the importance of this insertion to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the findings with Vero cells indicate the likelihood of cell culture adaptations in virus stocks that can influence reagent generation and interpretation of a wide range of data including neutralization and drug efficacy. Overall, our work highlights the importance of this key motif in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.\n\nArticle SummaryA deletion of the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 amplifies replication in Vero cells, but attenuates replication in respiratory cells and pathogenesis in vivo. Loss of the furin site also reduces susceptibility to neutralization in vitro.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryan A Johnson","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Birte Kalveram","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kumari G Lokugamage","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Antonio Muruato","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jing Zou","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xianwen Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Terry Juelich","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Smith","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Lihong Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Craig Schindewolf","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Michelle N Vu","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Abigail Vanderheiden","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Scott Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Mehul Suthar","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Laurence Routh","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

To gain entry, the virus uses its spike protein to bind to host hACE-2 receptors on the host cell surface and mediate fusion between viral and cell membranes. As initial steps leading to virus entry involves significant changes in protein conformation as well as in the electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the spike-hACE-2 complex, we explored the sensitivity of the interaction to changes in ionic strength through computational simulations and surface plasmon resonance. We identified two regions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), E1 and E2, which interact differently with hACE-2. At high salt concentration, E2-mediated interactions are weakened but are compensated by strengthening E1-mediated hydrophobic interactions. These results provide a detailed molecular understanding of spike RBD\/hACE-2 complex formation and stability under a wide range of ionic strengths.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=192 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/267351v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a7dc02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d3c78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d09c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db78a9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anacleto Silva de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose D.

This population experiences a higher proportion of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses than the general population and has been shown to have a high morbidity and mortality in relation to COVID-19. Methods We examined the number of hospital discharges to all Welsh adult care homes and the subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring over an 18 week period 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on the incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics (including size, type of provision and health board). Results A total of 1068 care homes were monitored; 330 homes experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, and 511 homes received a discharge from hospital over the study period. The exposure to discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.49, p = 0.28), after adjusting for care home size, which was by far the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison to homes of <10 residents were: 3.4 (2.0, 5.8) for 10-24 residents; 8.3 (5.0, 13.8) for 25-49 residents; and 17.3 (9.6, 31.1) for homes of 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were very similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison to periods when homes were unexposed. Conclusion Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.

Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April-May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer\/COVID-19 patients experience.\n\nAuthor SummaryCancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and non-cancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients. The high number of minor variations can result in the selection of immune escape variants, resistance to potential drugs, and\/or increased pathogenicity. The impact of this higher intrahost variability over time warrants further investigation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliana Siqueira","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Cancer"},{"author_name":"Livia  R.

Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of COVID-19. We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex RT-PCR on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S-amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swab) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (3 hospitals and 3 public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID-hospital, but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplets traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions and faecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by RT-PCR. Monitoring fomites can support evaluation of indirect transmission risks for Coronavirus or other flu-like viruses in the environment.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Piana","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Maria Eugenia Colucci","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Federica Valeriani","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Unit of Public Health-Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biotechnologies, University of Rome Foro Italico"},{"author_name":"Adriano Marcolongo","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Sotgiu","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Cesira Pasquarella","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Lory Marika Margarucci","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Unit of Public Health-Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biotechnologies, University of Rome Foro Italico"},{"author_name":"Andrea Petrucca","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Gianfranceschi","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, Unit of Public Health-Laboratory of Epidemiology and Biotechnologies, University of Rome Foro Italico"},{"author_name":"Sergio Babudieri","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Pietro Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

To determine the impact of school reopening with varying levels of operating capacity and face-mask adherence, we used an agent-based model calibrated to and validated against multiple data types from the state of Indiana, USA. In our model, transmission can occur in schools, workplaces, community settings, and households, all of which are structured in a realistic way according to state geography and demography. Using this model, we quantified the burden of COVID-19 on K-12 students, teachers, their families, and the general population under alternative scenarios about school reopening. In our primary analysis, we considered three levels of school operating capacity (50%, 75%, and 100%) and three assumptions about face-mask adherence in schools (50%, 75%, and 100%). Under a scenario in which schools operate remotely, we projected 45,579 (95% CrI: 14,109-132,546) infections and 790 (95% CrI: 176-1680) deaths between August 24 and December 31. Reopening at 100% capacity with 50% face-mask adherence in schools resulted in a proportional increase of 42.9 (95% CrI: 41.3-44.3) times that number of infections and 9.2 (95% CrI: 8.9-9.5) times that number of deaths. In contrast, operating at 50% capacity with 100% face-mask adherence resulted in only an 11% (95% CrI: 5%-18%) increase in the number of infections compared to the scenario in which schools operate remotely. We conclude that reduced capacity and high face-mask adherence in schools substantially reduce the burden of COVID-19, both among those with direct ties to schools and across the state. As Indiana and other states proceed with school reopening, our results illustrate quantitatively the benefits of safety measures that schools are undertaking, underscoring their value for both schools and their communities.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guido Espana","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean Cavany","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Rachel J Oidtman","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Carly Barbera","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alan Costello","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Anita Lerch","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Marya Poterek","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

Machine learning (ML) based technologies have played a substantial role in solving complex problems, and several organizations have been swift to adopt and customize them in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review on the role of ML as a comprehensive and decisive technology to fight the COVID-19 crisis in the arena of epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease progression. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify all potentially relevant studies published and made available between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020. The search syntax was built using keywords specific to COVID-19 and ML. A total of 128 qualified articles were reviewed and analyzed based on the study objectives. Results: The 128 publications selected were classified into three themes based on ML applications employed to combat the COVID-19 crisis: Computational Epidemiology (CE), Early Detection and Diagnosis (EDD), and Disease Progression (DP). Of the 128 studies, 70 focused on predicting the outbreak, the impact of containment policies, and potential drug discoveries, which were grouped into the CE theme. For the EDD, we grouped forty studies that applied ML techniques to detect the presence of COVID-19 using the patient's radiological images or lab results. Eighteen publications that focused on predicting the disease progression, outcomes (recovery and mortality), Length of Stay (LOS), and number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days for COVID-19 positive patients were classified under the DP theme. Conclusions: In this systematic review, we assembled the current COVID-19 literature that utilized ML methods to provide insights into the COVID-19 themes, highlighting the important variables, data types, and available COVID-19 resources that can assist in facilitating clinical and translational research.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hafsa Bareen Syeda","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahanazuddin Syed","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wayne Sexton","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shorabuddin Syed","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Salma Begum","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farhan Syed","author_inst":"Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feliciano Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Arkansas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

Yet, current methods for screening mental health issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, blocked by social stigmas and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in mental health profiles of users through a non-invasive manner. Objective: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. Methods: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental health profiles in terms of these features. Results: Of the 49 participants, 41% (n=20) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the PHQ-9 score > 5) in depression, denoted as DEP; 45% (n=22) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the GAD-7 score > 5) in anxiety, denoted as ANX. Of the 5 features proposed to quantify online behavior changes, statistical significances were found between the DEP and non-DEP groups for all of them (P<.01, effect sizes {eta}2partial ranging between 0.130 to 0.320); statistical significances were found between the ANX and non-ANX groups for 4 of them (P<.02, effect sizes {eta}2partial ranging between 0.115 to 0.231). Significant features included late-night online activities, continuous usages and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs. Conclusions: The results suggested strong discrepancies between college student groups with and without deteriorating mental health conditions in terms of behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube usages during the COVID-19. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anis Zaman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Boyu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Hoque","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Vincent Silenzio","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Henry Kautz","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Farhan Syed","author_inst":"Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feliciano Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Arkansas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

Numerous clinical variables have been retrospectively associated with disease severity, but the predictive value of these variables, and how multiple variables interact to increase risk, remains unclear. Methods: We used machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 severity in 354 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Using clinical variables only collected on or before a patient's COVID-19 positive date (time zero), we sought to classify patients into one of three possible future outcomes: Severe-early (the patient required high levels of oxygen support within 3 days of being tested positive for COVID-19), Severe-late (the patient required high levels of oxygen after 3 days), and Non-severe (the patient never required oxygen support). Results: Our algorithm classified patients into these classes with an AUROC ranging from 70-85%, significantly outperforming prior methods and univariate analyses. Critically, classification accuracy is highest when using a potpourri of clinical variables -- including patient demographics, pre-existing diagnoses, laboratory and radiological work, and underlying cancer type -- suggesting that COVID-19 in cancer patients comes with numerous, combinatorial risk factors. Conclusions: Overall, we provide a computational tool that can identify high-risk patients early in their disease progression, which could aid in clinical decision-making and selecting treatment options.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saket Navlakha","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sejal Morjaria","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Rocio Perez-Johnston","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Allen Zhang","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Ying Taur","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Farhan Syed","author_inst":"Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feliciano Yu Jr.","author_inst":"Arkansas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Tran","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Annaliese Wieler","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M Moore","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Ermo","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Assunta Bizzarro","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University Hospital, University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Scienze biotecnologiche di base, cliniche intensivologiche e perioperatorie-Sezione di Microbiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Azara","author_inst":"Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Romano","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Simmaco","author_inst":"Sant Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"University of Rome \"Foro Italico\""},{"author_name":"Ping Laurence Ren","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Ku","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang An","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Kari Debbink","author_inst":"Bowie State University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Alexander N.

Academic\/practical relevance: Vaccine is one of the most effective interventions to contain the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the initial supply of the COVID-19 vaccine will be limited. An urgent problem for the government is to determine who to get the first dose of the future COVID-19 vaccine. Methodology: We use epidemic data from New York City to calibrate an age-structured SAPHIRE model that captures the disease dynamics within and across various age groups. The model and data allow us to derive effective static and dynamic vaccine allocation policies minimizing the number of confirmed cases or the numbers of deaths. Results: The optimal static policies achieve a much smaller number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to other static benchmark policies including the pro rata policy. Dynamic allocation policies, including various versions of the myopic policy, significantly improve on static policies. Managerial implications: For static policies, our numerical study shows that prioritizing the older groups is beneficial to reduce deaths while prioritizing younger groups is beneficial to avert infections.

At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 578 randomly selected health care workers (HCW) from Hospital Clinic de Barcelona was 11.2%. Methods. A follow-up survey one month after the baseline (April-May 2020) measured SARS-CoV-2 infection by real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and IgM, IgA, IgG and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by Luminex. Prevalence of infection was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and\/or antibody seropositivity. Results. The cumulative prevalence of infection at month 1 was 14.9% (84\/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82\/565) for IgM and\/or IgG and\/or IgA. We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection at baseline (501) and two participants seroreverted for IgM and\/or IgG and\/or IgA. Among seropositive participants at baseline, IgM and IgA levels generally declined at month 1 (antibody decay rates of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.40-0.60) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.26-0.44)), respectively. Eight percent of the participants seroreverted for IgM and 11% for IgA. Subjects reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and laboratory and other technicians had higher risk of infection. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG2, followed by IgG3, with higher levels of IgG1, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the importance of a continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW, particularly in high risk groups. The decay of IgA and IgM levels have implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gemma Moncunill","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Santano","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alfons Jimenez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Marta Vidal","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Marta Tortajada","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sergi Sanz","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Susana Mendez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Anna Llupia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Ruth Aguilar","author_inst":"ISglobal"},{"author_name":"Selena Alonso","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Pau Cistero","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Choliz","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Angeline Cruz","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Silvia Fochs","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Chenjerai Jairoce","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Jochen Hecht","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Montserrat Lamoglia","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Mikel Martinez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Javier Moreno","author_inst":"ISglobal"},{"author_name":"Robert Mitchell","author_inst":"ISglobal"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ortega","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Nuria Pey","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Laura Puyol","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Marta Ribes","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Neus Rosell","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sotomayor","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Sara Torres","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Sarah Williams","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Sonia Barroso","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Anna Vilella","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Antoni Trilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Pilar Varela","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic"},{"author_name":"Carlota Dobano","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alberto L Garcia-Basteiro","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.23.20179408","rel_title":"Declining SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity with time and dependence on clinical features: consequences for control","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.23.20179408","rel_abs":"Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on upper respiratory tract (URT) samples is the primary method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections and guide public health measures, with a supportive role for serology.

In the present study, Bayesian statistical modeling was used to retrospectively determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2 serology in 644 COVID-19-suspected patients with varying degrees of disease severity and duration. The sensitivity of RT-PCR ranged between 79-95%; while increasing with disease severity, it decreased rapidly over time in mild COVID-19 cases. Negative URT RT-PCR results should therefore be interpreted in the context of clinical characteristics, especially with regard to containment of viral transmission based on the 'test, trace and isolate' principle.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Barbara J.M.

Recent studies have provided valuable insights regarding the dynamics of the antibody response in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. However, the information regarding the dynamics of the serological and cellular memory in COVID-19 recovered patients in scarce. It is imperative to determine the persistence of humoral memory in COVID-19 recovered patients as it will help to evaluate the susceptibility of recovered patients to re-infection. Here, we describe the dynamics of both the SARS-CoV-2 specific serological and B cell response in COVID-19 recovered patients. We found that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients mount a robust antibody response following infection however, the serological memory decays in recovered patients over the period of 6 months. On the other hand, the B cell response as observed in the SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cell compartment, was found to be stable over time. Moreover, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific B cell plasmablasts was found to be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels. These data, suggests that the differentiation of short-lived plasmablasts to become long-lived plasma cells is impaired and the main contributor of antibody production are the short-lived plasmablasts. Overall, our data provides insights regarding the humoral memory persistence in recovered COVID-19 patients. Notwithstanding the insights from this study, it is still to be determined if the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells can be considered as a correlate of protection in the absence of serological memory.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Vaisman-Mentesh","author_inst":"1The Shmunis School of Biomedicine and Cancer Research, George S.

In the Philippines, with a large population of overseas Filipino contract workers (OFWs), as well as foreign workers in the local online gaming industry and visitors from nearby countries, the first reported cases were from a Chinese couple visiting the country in mid-January 2020. Three months on, by mid-March, the COVID-19 cases in the Philippines had reached its first 100, before it exploded to the present 178,022 cases (as of August 20, 2020). Here, we report a genomic survey of six (6) whole genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus collected from COVID-19 patients seen at the Philippine General Hospital, the major referral hospital for COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila at about the time the Philippines had over a hundred cases. Analysis of commonly observed variants did not reveal a clear pattern of the virus evolving towards a more infectious and severe strain. When combined with other available viral sequences from the Philippines and from GISAID, phylogenomic analysis reveal that the sequenced Philippine isolates can be classified into three primary groups based on collection dates and possible infection sources: (1) January samples collected in the early phases of the pandemic that are closely associated with isolates from Wuhan, China; (2) March samples that are mainly linked to the M\/V Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak; and (3) June samples that clustered with European isolates, one of which already harbor the globally prevalent D614G mutation which initially circulated in Europe. The presence of community-acquired viral transmission amidst compulsory and strict quarantine protocols, particularly for repatriated Filipino workers, highlights the need for a refinement of the quarantine, testing, and tracing strategies currently being implemented to adapt to the current pandemic situation.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francis A.

However, seroprevalence studies have been scarce in South East Asia including India, which, as of now, carries the third largest burden of confirmed cases in the world. The present study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody among hospitalized patients at one of the largest government hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India, recruited consecutive patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or CB-NAAT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels targeting recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS CoV-2 were estimated in serum samples by the ELISA method. Results: A total of 212 hospitalized patients were recruited in the study with mean age (+\/-SD) of 41.2 (+\/-15.4) years and 55% male population. Positive serology against SARS CoV-2 was detected in 19.8% patients(95% CI 14.7-25.8). Residency in Delhi conferred a higher frequency of seropositivity 26.5% (95% CI 19.3-34.7) as compared to that of other states 8% (95% CI 3.0-16.4) with p-value 0.001. No particular age groups or socio-economic strata showed a higher proportion of seropositivity. Conclusion: Around, one-fifth of hospitalized patients, who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 before, demonstrated seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2. While there was no significant difference in the different age groups and socio-economic classes; residence in Delhi was associated with increased risk (relative risk of 3.62, 95% CI 1.59-8.21) Key Words: SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody, Seroprevalence, Hospitalized patient, COVID-19","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Animesh Ray","author_inst":"All India Institute Of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute Of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Souvick Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana"},{"author_name":"Farha Mehdi","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Batra","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana"},{"author_name":"Aakansha Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ayush Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bhavesh M","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Sahni","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chaithra R","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shubham Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chitrakshi Nagpal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gagantej B H","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Umang Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kartikeya Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ranveer Singh Jadon","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashish Datt Upadhyay","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Nischal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naval K Vikram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"R M Pandey","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Alessandra C.

Methods: We developed an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission among healthcare workers in a hospital setting. We calibrated the model using data of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital unit in Wuhan in a Bayesian framework. The calibrated model was used to simulate different intervention scenarios and estimate the impact of different interventions on outbreak size and workday loss. Results: We estimated that work-related stress increases susceptibility to COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers by 52% (90% Credible Interval (CrI): 16.4% - 93.0%). The use of high efficacy facial masks was shown to be able to reduce infection cases and workday loss by 80% (90% CrI: 73.1% - 85.7%) and 87% (CrI: 80.0% - 92.5%), respectively. The use of social distancing alone, through reduced contacts between healthcare workers, had a marginal impact on the outbreak. A strict quarantine policy with the isolation of symptomatic cases and a high fraction of pre-symptomatic\/ asymptomatic cases (via contact tracing or high test rate), could only prolong outbreak duration with minimal impact on the outbreak size. Our results indicated that a quarantine policy should be coupled with other interventions to achieve its effect. The effectiveness of all these interventions was shown to increase with their early implementation. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital's non-COVID-19 unit can be controlled or mitigated by the use of existing non-pharmaceutical measures.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qimin Huang","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Anirban Mondal","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mary Ann Horn","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Fei Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"David Gurarie","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Shubham Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chitrakshi Nagpal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gagantej B H","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Umang Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kartikeya Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ranveer Singh Jadon","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ashish Datt Upadhyay","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Nischal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naval K Vikram","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"R M Pandey","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Alessandra C.

While acute and intermediate interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively, long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remained to be analyzed. Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully capable to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon TCR stimulation. Collectively, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of immune signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"jia liu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuecheng Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua Wang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Ziwei Li","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Deng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Liu jing","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shue Xiong","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Junyi He","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Guo","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Gennadiy Zelinskyy","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Sutter","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Menne","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Feng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Shaira A.

This influences all the parameters that govern the statistical models used for controlling the infection. Purpose: This work proposes two models based on experimental data. The Logistic Model it is used to obtain three parameters of the epidemic cycle of COVID-19, namely: the final count for the total infected, the daily infection rate and the lag time. Complimentary, a novel inventory model is proposed to calculate the number of infective persons, as well as to determine the incubation period. Methods: The data on epidemic cycles of Germany, Italy, and Sweden are treated previously by the Moving Average Method with Initial value (MAMI), then a variation of the Logistic Model, obtained through curve-fitting, is used to obtain the three parameters. The inventory model is introduced to calculate the actual number of infected persons and the behavior of the incubation period is analyzed. Results: After comparing data from the three countries it is possible to determine the actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles for each one, determine the size of the incubation period, as well as to determine the total number of infective persons during the cycle. Conclusions: The actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles in the countries analyzed are determined, the total number of infected is determined, and it is statistically proven that the incubation cycle for Sars-CoV-2 is five days.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rogerio Atem De Carvalho","author_inst":"Instituto Federal Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Atem De Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Berg de Almeida","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Botucatu School of Medicine, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP).

Here we report biological and epidemiological aspects of this mutation. Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we were able to confirm that the G614 variant of the Spike protein is markedly more infectious than the ancestral D614 variant. We demonstrate by molecular modelling that the replacement of aspartate by glycine in position 614 facilitates the transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To understand whether the increased infectivity of the D614 variant explains its epidemiological success, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G\/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D\/P variant. There was no significant correlation between reported COVID mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G\/L variant. However, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, the G\/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sten Ilmj\u00e4rv","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Fabien Abdul","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Silvia Acosta-Guti\u00e9rrez","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London; Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London; Institute of Structural and Molecula"},{"author_name":"Carolina Estarellas","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Galdadas","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London"},{"author_name":"Marina Casimir","author_inst":"Neurix SA"},{"author_name":"Marco Alessandrini","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Francesco Luigi Gervasio","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Karl-Heinz Krause","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva; Division of Infectious Disease and Dept. of Diagnostics, Geneva University Ho"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Gennadiy Zelinskyy","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Sutter","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Menne","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Feng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Shaira A.

While evidence suggests masks help curb the spread of respiratory pathogens, research is limited. Face masks have quickly become a topic of public debate as government mandates have started requiring their use. Here we investigate the association between self-reported mask wearing, social distancing and community SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States, as well as the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. Methods: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered June 3 through July 31, 2020 via web platform. Surveys queried individuals' likelihood to wear a face mask to the grocery store or with family and friends. Responses (N=378,207) were aggregated by week and state and combined with measures of the instantaneous reproductive number (Rt), social distancing proxies, respondent demographics and other potential sources of confounding. We fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask wearing and community transmission control (Rt <1) for each state and week. Multiple sensitivity analyses were considered to corroborate findings across mask wearing definitions, Rt estimators and data sources. Additionally, mask wearing in 12 states was evaluated two weeks before and after statewide mandates. Results: We find an upward trend in mask usage across the U.S., although uptake varies by geography and demographic groups. A multivariate logistic model controlling for social distancing and other variables found a 10% increase in mask wearing was associated with a 3.53 (95% CI: 2.03, 6.43) odds of transmission control (Rt <1). We also find that communities with high mask wearing and social distancing have the highest predicted probability of a controlled epidemic. These positive associations were maintained across sensitivity analyses. Segmented regression analysis of mask wearing found no statistical change following mandates, however the positive trend of increased mask wearing over time was preserved. Conclusion: Widespread utilization of face masks combined with social distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Mask wearing rose separately from government mask mandates, suggesting supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximize mask adoption and disrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially as social distancing measures are relaxed.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Rader","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Laura F White","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Michael R Burns","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jack Chen","author_inst":"SurveyMonkey"},{"author_name":"Joe Brilliant","author_inst":"SurveyMonkey"},{"author_name":"Jon Cohen","author_inst":"SurveyMonkey"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Larry Brilliant","author_inst":"Pandefense Advisors"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Sutter","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Menne","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Feng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Shaira A.

Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 testing is performed during clinical encounters with symptomatic individuals, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance and can effectively surveil communities with less temporal lag than other surveillance methods. However, epidemiologically-defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Methods: Herein we describe methods for developing a geographically-resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky which may have general applicability for cities throughout the United States. This approach was developed by the selection of sampling locations along sewer lines transporting raw wastewater from geographically and demographically distinct areas that correspond with locations where random testing of residents occurs. Conclusions: Development of this protocol for population-level sampling for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater can be utilized to inform consistent wastewater monitoring among cities for up-to-date and geographically-resolved information on COVID-19 prevalence within communities. This information could substantially supplement public health surveillance of COVID-19 and thus serve to better guide targeted mitigation strategies throughout the United States.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ray A Yeager","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Rochelle H Holm","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Kumar Saurabh","author_inst":"James Graham Brown Canter Center, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Joshua L Fuqua","author_inst":"Center for Predictive Medicine, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Daymond Talley","author_inst":"Louisville\/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District, Morris Forman Water Quality Treatment Center"},{"author_name":"Aruni Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Ted R Smith","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Larry Brilliant","author_inst":"Pandefense Advisors"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Sutter","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Menne","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Feng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Shaira A.

Digital surveillance has been shown to be useful to supplement the traditional surveillance. Google Trends  (GT) is one such platform reported to be useful during pandemics of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. Objective: We used GT to correlate the information seeking behaviour regarding COVID-19 of Indians with curiosity and apprehensiveness generated through media coverage as well as status of the epidemic both at national and state levels. Methods: We retrieved GT data between 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020 for India using a comprehensive search strategy. We obtained data on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org websites. We explored the trends of COVID-19 in the form of relative search volume (RSV) from GT platform and correlated them with media reports. We used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between Google search terms and daily new COVID-19 cases and daily tests for 14 days. Results: Peaks in RSV correlated with media coverage or government declarations suggestive of curiosity and apprehensiveness both at national level and high-burden states. High time-lag correlation was observed between both the daily reported number of tests and cases and RSV for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'' and ''lockdown'' at national level. Similar high time-lag correlation was observed for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''Corona'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'', ''lockdown'' in five high-burden states. Conclusion: This study reveals the advantages of infodemiology using GT to monitor an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19 in India. Google searches in India during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reflects mostly curiosity and apprehension of citizens. GT can also complement traditional surveillance in India as well as high burden states.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Parmeshwar D Satpathy","author_inst":"AIIMS BHOPAL"},{"author_name":"Sanjeev Kumar","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Prasad","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Joshua L Fuqua","author_inst":"Center for Predictive Medicine, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Daymond Talley","author_inst":"Louisville\/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District, Morris Forman Water Quality Treatment Center"},{"author_name":"Aruni Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Ted R Smith","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Larry Brilliant","author_inst":"Pandefense Advisors"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Sutter","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Menne","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, Heinrich-Heine-University, University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Feng","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Union hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Shaira A.
