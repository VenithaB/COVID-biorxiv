Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649\/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhong-Yin Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Hang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Yue-Dong Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Yin-Qiao Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Min-Sheng Peng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"David M Irwin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Haipeng Li","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chin"},{"author_name":"Jian Lu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, Center for Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Yiming Bao","author_inst":"National Genomics Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing 100101, China."},{"author_name":"Xuemei Lu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Ya-ping Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.09.243246","rel_title":"Discovery of COVID-19 Inhibitors Targeting the SARS-CoV2 Nsp13 Helicase","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.09.243246","rel_abs":"The raging COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV2 has infected millions of people and killed several hundred thousand patients worldwide.

Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics approaches, we generated structural models of the SARS-CoV2 helicase in its apo- and ATP\/RNA-bound conformations. We performed virtual screening of ~970,000 chemical compounds against the ATP binding site to identify potential inhibitors. Herein, we report docking hits of approved human drugs targeting the ATP binding site. Importantly, two of our top drug hits have significant activity in inhibiting purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 helicase, providing hope that these drugs can be potentially repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark A White","author_inst":"The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Cheng","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Yin-Qiao Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Min-Sheng Peng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"David M Irwin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Haipeng Li","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chin"},{"author_name":"Jian Lu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, Center for Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Yiming Bao","author_inst":"National Genomics Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing 100101, China."},{"author_name":"Xuemei Lu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Ya-ping Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.09.20149286","rel_title":"The effect of public health policies in the transmission of COVID-19 for South American countries","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.09.20149286","rel_abs":"Objectives: The analysis of transmission dynamics is crucial to determine whether mitigation or suppression measures reduce the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study sought to estimate the basic (R0) and time-dependent (Rt) reproduction number of COVID-19 and contrast the public health measures for ten South American countries. Methods: Data was obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Country-specific R0 estimates during the first two weeks of the outbreak and Rt estimates after 90 days were estimated. Results: Countries used a combination of isolation, social distancing, quarantine, and community-wide containment measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 at different points in time. R0 ranged from 1.52 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.99) in Venezuela, to 3.83 (3.04-4.75) in Chile, whereas Rt, after 90 days, ranged from 0.71 (95% credible interval: 0.39-1.05) in Uruguay to 1.20 (1.19-1.20) in Brazil. Different R0 and Rt values may be related to the testing capacity of each country. Conclusion: R0 in the early phase of the outbreak varied across the South American countries. The adopted public health measures in the initial period of the pandemic appear to have reduced Rt over time in each country.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryan Valcarcel","author_inst":"Milken Institute School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jose L Avilez","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"J.

Here, we describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array and induce neutralizing antibody titers roughly ten-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain trimer despite a more than five-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles, especially compared to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S trimer, suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms for inducing potent neutralizing antibody responses and have launched cGMP manufacturing efforts to advance the lead RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the clinic.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra C Walls","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Minh N Pham","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Murphy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Longping V Tse","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Laila Shehata","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chengbo Chen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mary Jane Navarro","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Miranda","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Ravichandran","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John C Kraft","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cassandra Ogohara","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anne Palser","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sara Chalk","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"E-Chiang Lee","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Kepl","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cameron M Chow","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Claire Sydeman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Hodge","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brieann Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jim T Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Thomas B Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Miklos Guttman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kelly K Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah H Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

No effective treatment is currently available for severe COVID-19 disease. One strategy for implementing cell-based immunity involves the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology. Unlike CAR T cells, which need to be developed using primary T cells derived from COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia, clinical success of CAR NK cell immunotherapy is possible through the development of allogeneic, universal, and  off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from a third party, which will significantly broaden the application and reduce costs. Here, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022 (henceforth, CR3022-CAR-NK), a broadly neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and can be activated by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles in vitro. Further, CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells. Thus,  off-the-shelf CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Minh Tuyet Ma","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Saiaditya Badeti","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Ke Geng","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Dongfang Liu","author_inst":"Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Minh N Pham","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Murphy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Longping V Tse","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Laila Shehata","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chengbo Chen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mary Jane Navarro","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Miranda","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Ravichandran","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John C Kraft","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cassandra Ogohara","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anne Palser","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sara Chalk","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"E-Chiang Lee","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Kepl","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cameron M Chow","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Claire Sydeman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Hodge","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brieann Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jim T Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Thomas B Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Miklos Guttman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kelly K Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah H Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg-1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells.

This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma})-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-{gamma} receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs.

Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism.

It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.\n\nImportanceThe large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune responses. Our study contributes to our understanding of the direct immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 by showing that NSP8 suppresses the most upstream sensor of innate immune responses involved in the recognition of viral dsRNA.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziwei Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Fan Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Peihui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojuan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Ersheng Kuang","author_inst":"Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine and Science, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wang","author_inst":"The Advanced Institute for Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Zhang","author_inst":"Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of TCM"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Song Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Huang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junping Wang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Zhao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Anne Palser","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sara Chalk","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"E-Chiang Lee","author_inst":"Kymab Ltd"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Kepl","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cameron M Chow","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Claire Sydeman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Hodge","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brieann Brown","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jim T Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Thomas B Lewis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Miklos Guttman","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kelly K Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah H Fuller","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

In this context, human convalescent plasma has been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the efficacy remains uncertain. Objective: To explore potential signals of efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Design: Open-label, Expanded Access Program (EAP) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with human convalescent plasma. Setting: Multicenter, including 2,807 acute care facilities in the US and territories. Participants: Adult participants enrolled and transfused under the purview of the US Convalescent Plasma EAP program between April 4 and July 4, 2020 who were hospitalized with (or at risk of) severe or life threatening acute COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. Intervention: Transfusion of at least one unit of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma using standard transfusion guidelines at any time during hospitalization. Convalescent plasma was donated by recently-recovered COVID-19 survivors, and the antibody levels in the units collected were unknown at the time of transfusion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seven and thirty-day mortality. Results: The 35,322 transfused patients had heterogeneous demographic and clinical characteristics. This cohort included a high proportion of critically-ill patients, with 52.3% in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 27.5% receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of plasma transfusion. The seven-day mortality rate was 8.7% [95% CI 8.3%-9.2%] in patients transfused within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis but 11.9% [11.4%-12.2%] in patients transfused 4 or more days after diagnosis (p<0.001). Similar findings were observed in 30-day mortality (21.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.0001). Importantly, a gradient of mortality was seen in relation to IgG antibody levels in the transfused plasma. For patients who received high IgG plasma (>18.45 S\/Co), seven-day mortality was 8.9% (6.8%, 11.7%); for recipients of medium IgG plasma (4.62 to 18.45 S\/Co) mortality was 11.6% (10.3%, 13.1%); and for recipients of low IgG plasma (<4.62 S\/Co) mortality was 13.7% (11.1%, 16.8%) (p=0.048). This unadjusted dose-response relationship with IgG was also observed in thirty-day mortality (p=0.021). The pooled relative risk of mortality among patients transfused with high antibody level plasma units was 0.65 [0.47-0.92] for 7 days and 0.77 [0.63-0.94] for 30 days compared to low antibody level plasma units. Conclusions and Relevance: The relationships between reduced mortality and both earlier time to transfusion and higher antibody levels provide signatures of efficacy for convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This information may be informative for the treatment of COVID-19 and design of randomized clinical trials involving convalescent plasma.

A response from N= 351 students (from the most affected state in India), provided a comparative analysis based on the gender, and background to understand the pattern in issues related to mental health during the pandemic. The results show that female students are more concerned about health, and future, and are more prone to psychological issues like feelings of uncertainty, helplessness and outbursts than male students. Urban student population is more mentally affected than their rural counterparts, however time spent on the internet is almost the same despite the difference in infrastructure and resources. Also, there is an increase in need for solitude, being withdrawn and self-harm in male students require attention. A shift in perception from seeing family as a source of support to that of a restriction is indicated, although the benefits of a collectivist society are undisputed. The results indicate that there is overall increased awareness about mental health among the student population and with programs\/strategies focusing on background and gender, a significant improvement is attainable.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kshipra Moghe","author_inst":"Asst Professor of Psychology, Department of Applied Science, College of Engineering Pune, Shivajinagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Disha Kotecha","author_inst":"Final year, Department of Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering, College of Engineering Pune, Shivajinagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Manjusha Patil","author_inst":"Final year, Department of Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering, College of Engineering Pune, Shivajinagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Maayan Eilon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Mor","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amir Shimon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Romano Strobelt","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Maya Shemesh","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Sarel J Fleishman","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ron Diskin","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Katie L Kunze","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Sexton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Juan C Diaz Soto","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Baker","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John R.A.

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study to assess the effect of HCQ and Azithromycin on duration from symptom onset to negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR using nasopharyngeal swab in hospitalized patient with COVID-19. Eighty-five patients were included in the study, 65 in HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) and 20 in non-HCQ group. Measurement of duration from symptom onset to negative PCR and effect of gender, age and disease severity on time to viral clearance was measured. Results: Median time to negative PCR in HCQ group was 23 days (IQR: 9, Mean 24+8, N=65) compared with non-HCQ group, 19 days (IQR: 8, Mean 18+6, N=20), (p <0.05). Forty-one (63%) patients in HCQ group and all patients (100%) in non-HCQ group had mild disease. Multivariate regression model (F=6.8, P<0.002, R2=0.20) shows that being in HCQ group would delay the time to negative PCR by 7 days (95%CI: 2-12) and with every year increase in the age, the time to negative PCR would be delayed by 0.12 days (95%CI: 0.017-0.22). Among HCQ sub-groups, gender and disease severity had no effect on duration (p 0.142 and 0.156 respectively) but older patients >60 year had longer duration compared to patients <60 year of age although p value did not reach significance (p 0.073). Median time to negative PCR in mild-HCQ group (23 days, IQR: 9, Mean 23+8, N=41) was longer when compared with non-HCQ group (p <0.05). On day 28, all patients in non-HCQ group had negative PCR while only 50\/65 (77%) were negative in HCQ group. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin delay SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and it is correlated with older age. Larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarfraz A Saleemi","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Abdulrahman Alrajhi","author_inst":"Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alhajji","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Areej Alfattani","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Scientific Computing.

This study aimed to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on national SAVR and TAVR activity and outcomes. Methods The UK TAVR Registry and the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit were used to identify all TAVR and SAVR procedures in England, between January 2017 and June 2020. The number of isolated AVR, AVR+coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, AVR+other surgery and TAVR procedures per month was calculated. Separate negative binomial regression models were fit to monthly procedural counts, with functions of time as covariates, to estimate the expected change in activity during COVID-19. Results We included 13376 TAVR cases, 12328 isolated AVR cases, 7829 AVR+CABG cases, and 6014 AVR+Other cases. Prior to March 2020 (UK lockdown), monthly TAVR activity was rising, with a slight decrease in SAVR activity during 2019. We observed a rapid and significant drop in TAVR and SAVR activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for elective cases. Cumulatively, over the period March to June 2020, we estimated an expected 2294 (95% CI 1872, 2716) cases of severe aortic stenosis who have not received treatment. Conclusion This study has demonstrated a significant decrease in TAVR and SAVR activity in England following the COVID-19 outbreak. This situation should be monitored closely, to ensure that monthly activity rapidly returns to expected levels. There is potential for significant backlog in the near-to-medium term, and potential for increased mortality in this population.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Glen P Martin","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Nick Curzen","author_inst":"University of Southamptom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Goodwin","author_inst":"South Tees Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Nolan","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lognathen Balacumaraswami","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Peter Ludman","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Kontopantelis","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mamas A Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Sexton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Juan C Diaz Soto","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Baker","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John R.A.

Major components of rabies prevention programs in Latin America leading to these successes have been constant and intense surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. However, vital measures to control COVID-19 in Latin America have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. In this paper, we aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics parameterized for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, where there is an ongoing dog rabies epidemic. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance leading to an increased length of survival of infected dogs could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies and, subsequently, human rabies risk. We examined our results over the best estimate of the basic reproductive number in Arequipa (R0 = 1.44) and a range of plausible values for R0 (1.36 - 2). The rising trend was consistent. It is very possible that COVID-19 will continue to challenge our public health departments in the short- and medium-term. Innovative strategies to conduct dog vaccination and rabies surveillance during these trying times should be considered to safeguard the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies. Resumen (Abstract in Spanish) En las ultimas decadas ha habido un tremendo progreso hacia la eliminacion de la rabia canina en America Latina. Los principales componentes de los programas de prevencion de la rabia en America Latina que condujeron a estos exitos han sido la vigilancia constante e intensa de los perros con rabia y las campanas anuales de vacunacion masiva ininterrumpida. Sin embargo, las medidas esenciales para controlar el COVID-19 en America Latina han tenido el balance negativo de poner en peligro estas actividades de prevencion y eliminacion de rabia. En este articulo, nuestro objetivo fue evaluar el efecto que la interrupcion de la vigilancia de la rabia canina y las campanas de vacunacion masiva de perros tendria en las tendencias de la rabia. Modelamos la dinamica de la rabia canina mediante un modelo deterministico de comportamientos parametrizado para las condiciones que se encuentran en Arequipa, Peru, donde hay una epidemia de rabia canina en curso. Nuestro modelo sugiere que una disminucion en la cobertura de vacunacion canina, asi como una disminucion en la vigilancia (que llevaria a una mayor supervivencia de los perros infectados), podria llevar a un aumento subito de rabia canina y, seguidamente, del riesgo de rabia humana. Examinamos nuestros resultados sobre la mejor estimacion del numero reproductivo basico en Arequipa (R0 = 1.44) y un rango de valores plausibles para R0 (1.36 - 2). La tendencia al alza fue consistente. Es muy posible que el COVID-19 continue desafiando a nuestros departamentos de salud publica a corto y mediano plazo. Por lo tanto, deben considerarse estrategias innovadoras para llevar a cabo la vacunacion de perros y la vigilancia de la rabia durante estos tiempos dificiles para salvaguardar los logros alcanzados en America Latina hacia la eliminacion de la rabia humana mediada por perros.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brinkley Raynor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Elvis W.

While symptom screening has the benefit of reducing the number of infected individuals in the workplace, it raises some inherently difficult privacy issues as a traditional approach requires the employer to collect symptom data from each employee which is essentially medical information. In this paper, we describe a system to implement Cryptographic Anonymous Symptom Screening (CASS) which allows for individuals to perform COVID symptom screening anonymously while avoiding the privacy issues of traditional approaches. In the system, individuals report their symptoms without any identifying information and are issued a completion certificate. This certificate contains a cryptographic code which certifies that the certificate was obtained from the screener after reporting no symptoms. The codes can be verified using a cryptographic algorithm which is publicly available. A standard cryptography approach to implement such a system would be to use digital signatures. Unfortunately, standard digital signatures have some limitations for this application in that the signatures are often hundreds of characters long and if the signature contains the name of the individual, then there is also a risk of compromising privacy. In our approach, we develop and utilize a relaxed digital signature scheme to provide 16 character long codes and handle names using equivalence classes which helps preserve privacy. Both of these extensions technically compromise the security but in a way that is negligible for this application. Our system can either serve the function of standard symptom screening system approaches for employees, but can also extend symptom screening to non-employees such as visitors or customers. In this case, the system can be utilized in retail, restaurants and schools to ensure that everyone in the physical space, including employees, customers, visitors and students have performed symptom screening.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brandon Jew","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Alexis Korb","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Paul Lou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Chiang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ulzee An","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Amit Sahai","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mamas A Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Sexton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Juan C Diaz Soto","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Baker","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John R.A.

Design: A cross-sectional study of care homes, ascertaining perceived disease burden using interviews with care home managers and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in residents and staff using nose and throat swabbing. Setting: 15 Care homes in Essex, United Kingdom, all of which had reported either zero or one case of COVID-19 to the Health Protection Team. Participants: 912 residents and staff of care homes were tested. Residents were eligible to be tested regardless of symptoms. Main outcome measure: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in residents and staff. Results: In the 15 care homes studied, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 23 (5.2%)of 441 residents. Of these 23, 21\/23 (91%) were asymptomatic as reported by the care home managers. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 8\/471 (1.7%) of staff. This differs from that in residents (p=0.003). Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that symptoms, as reported by care home managers, are an insensitive method of defining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes. Viral detection from residents is more common than from staff. Microbiological screening is a more sensitive method for defining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes than managerial reporting of resident symptoms.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Starling","author_inst":"Essex County Council"},{"author_name":"Eleanor White","author_inst":"Essex County Council"},{"author_name":"Danny Showell","author_inst":"Essex County Council"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Smita Kapadia","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ravikumar Balakrishnan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mamas A Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Sexton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Juan C Diaz Soto","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Baker","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John R.A.

Neutrophilia and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators of inflammation are common finds in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. By its action on leukocytes, we propose colchicine as an intervention worthy of being tested. Objective. To evaluate whether the addition of colchicine to standard treatment for COVID-19 results in better outcomes. Methods. We present the interim analysis of a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 38 patients allocated 1:1 from April 11 to July 06, 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The first dose was 1.0 mg whether body weight was [&ge;] 80 kg. Endpoints. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalization; need for admission and length of stay in intensive care units; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints, we assessed: serum C-reactive protein, serum Lactate dehydrogenase and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day zero to day 7; the number, type, and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms. Results. Thirty-five patients (18 for Placebo and 17 for Colchicine) completed the study. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory data at baseline. Median (and interquartile range) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 3.0 (1.5-6.5) days for the Colchicine group and 7.0 (3.0-8.5) days for Placebo group (p = 0.02). Median (IQR) time of hospitalization was 6.0 (4.0-8.5) days for the Colchicine group and 8.5 (5.5-11.0) days for Placebo group (p = 0.03). At day 2, 53% vs 83% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7 the values were 6% vs 39%, in the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). Hospitalization was maintained for 53% vs 78% of patients at day 5 and 6% vs 17% at day 10, for the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). One patient per group needed admission to ICU. No recruited patient died. At day 4, patients of Colchicine group presented significant reduction of serum C-reactive protein compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The majority of adverse events were mild and did not lead to patient withdrawal. Diarrhea was more frequent in the Colchicine group (p = 0.17). Cardiac adverse events were absent. Discussion. The use of colchicine reduced the length of supplemental oxygen therapy and the length of hospitalization. Clinical improvement was in parallel with a reduction on serum levels of C-reactive protein. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Colchicine may be considered a beneficial and not expensive option for COVID-19 treatment. Clinical trials with larger numbers of patients should be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine as an adjunctive therapy for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Isabel F Lopes","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcela C Giannini","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Natalia B Amaral","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maira N Benatti","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Uebe C Rezek","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Laerte L Emrich-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Betania AA Sousa","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sergio CL Almeida","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Luppino-Assad","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flavio P Veras","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ayda Schneider","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Tamara S Rodrigues","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luiz OS Leiria","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Larissa D Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose C Alves-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eurico Arruda Neto","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos H Miranda","author_inst":"Sao Paulo University"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pazin-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria A Martins","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Philippe R Bauer","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Janis E Blair","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nigel S Paneth","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"DeLisa Fairweather","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"R.

The basic probabilistic model estimates likely number of primary schools with one or more infected persons under three different return-to-school circumstances. Inputs to the infection hazard model are: the inventory of children, teachers and support staff; the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community including its spatial variation, and the ratio of adult susceptibility to that of children. Three scenarios of inventory are: the counts on 1st June when schools re-opened to Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children, when approximately one-third of eligible children attended; a scenario assuming a full return of eligible children in those cohorts; and a return of all primary age children, scheduled for September. With a national average prevalence, we find that for the first scenario between 178 and 924 schools out of 16,769 in total (i.e. about 1% and 5.5% respectively) may have infected individuals present, expressed as a 90% credible interval. For the second scenario, the range is between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) schools with one (or more) infected persons, while for the third scenario the range is 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) schools, assuming that the prevalence is the same as it was on 5th June. The range decreases to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools with an infected person if prevalence is one-quarter that of 5th June, and increases to between 2131 (13%) and 9743 (58%) schools for the situation where prevalence increases to 4 times the 5th June level. Net prevalence of COVID-19 in schools is reduced relative to the general community because of the lower susceptibility of primary age children to infection. When regional variations in prevalence and school size distribution are taken into account there is a slight decrease in number of infected schools, but the uncertainty on these projected numbers increases markedly. The probability of having an infected school in a community is proportional to the local prevalence and school size. Analysis of a scenario equivalent to a full return to school with an average national prevalence of 1 in 1700 and spatial prevalence variations, estimated from data for late June, indicates 82% of infected schools would be located in areas where prevalence exceeds the national average. The probability of having multiple infected persons in a school increases markedly in high prevalence areas. Assuming national prevalence characteristic of early June, individual, operational and societal risk will increase if schools re-open fully in September due to both increases in numbers of children and the increased challenges of sustaining mitigation measures. Comparison between incidents in primary schools with positive tests in June and July and our estimates of number of infected schools indicates at least an order of magnitude difference. The much lower number of incidents reflects several factors, including effective reduction in transmission resulting from risk mitigation measure instigated by schools.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen RJ Sparks","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"William P Aspinall","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Roger Cooke","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jane H Scarrow","author_inst":"University of Grenada"},{"author_name":"Maira N Benatti","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Uebe C Rezek","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Laerte L Emrich-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Betania AA Sousa","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sergio CL Almeida","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Luppino-Assad","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flavio P Veras","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ayda Schneider","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Tamara S Rodrigues","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luiz OS Leiria","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Larissa D Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose C Alves-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eurico Arruda Neto","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos H Miranda","author_inst":"Sao Paulo University"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pazin-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria A Martins","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Philippe R Bauer","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Janis E Blair","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nigel S Paneth","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"DeLisa Fairweather","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"R.

Modifying Z\/o\\[t] to allow exponential cutoffs: Z\/E\\[t] = +[G\/o\\ \/ (1 + {gamma}\/o\\ t) ] [exp( - {delta}\/o\\ t - q\/o\\ t^2 ] = Z\/o\\[t] [exp( - {delta}\/o\\ t - q\/o\\ t^2 ] , provides a new Enhanced Initial Model (EIM), which significantly improves datafits, where N\/E\\[t] = exp(+G\/o\\) exp( - Z\/E\\[t] ). Since large variations are present in {rho}\/data\\[t], these models were generalized into an orthogonal function series, to provide additional data fitting parameters: N(Z) = Sum{m = (0, M\/F\\)} g\/m\\ L\/m\\(Z) exp[-Z]. Its first term can give N\/o\\[t] or N\/E\\[t], for Z=Z\/o\\[t] or Z=Z\/E\\[t]. The L\/m\\(Z) are Laguerre Polynomials, with L\/0\\(Z)=1, and {g\/m\\; m= (0, M\/F\\)} are constants derived from each dataset. When {rho}[t]=dN[t]\/dt gradually decreases, using Z\/o\\[t] provided good datafits at small M\/F\\ values, but was inadequate if {rho}[t] decreased faster. For those cases, Z\/E\\[t] was used in the above N(Z) series to give the most general Enhanced Orthogonal Function [EOF] model developed here. Even with M\/F\\=0 and q\/o\\=0, this EOF model fit the Italy CoVID-19 data for {rho}[t] = dN[t]\/dt fairly well. When the {rho}[t] post-peak behavior is not Gaussian, then Z\/E\\[t] with {delta}\/o\\=0, q\/o\\=0; which we call Z\/A\\[t], is also likely to be a sufficient extension of the Z\/o\\[t] model. The EOF model also can model a gradually decreasing {rho}[t] tail using small {{delta}\/o\\, q\/o\\} values [with 6 Figures].","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genghmun Eng","author_inst":"Retired Scientist"},{"author_name":"William P Aspinall","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Roger Cooke","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jane H Scarrow","author_inst":"University of Grenada"},{"author_name":"Maira N Benatti","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Uebe C Rezek","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Laerte L Emrich-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Betania AA Sousa","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sergio CL Almeida","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Luppino-Assad","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flavio P Veras","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ayda Schneider","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Tamara S Rodrigues","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luiz OS Leiria","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Larissa D Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose C Alves-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eurico Arruda Neto","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos H Miranda","author_inst":"Sao Paulo University"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pazin-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria A Martins","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Philippe R Bauer","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Janis E Blair","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nigel S Paneth","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"DeLisa Fairweather","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"R.

While many institutions have released return-to-campus plans designed to reduce viral spread and to rapidly identify outbreaks should they occur, in many cases communications by college administrators have been opaque. To contribute to an evaluation of university preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed a crucial element: COVID-19 on-campus testing. We examined testing plans at more than 500 colleges and universities throughout the US, and collated statistics, as well as narratives from publicly facing websites. We discovered a highly variable and muddled state of COVID-19 testing plans among US institutions of higher education that has been shaped by discrepancies between scientific studies and federal guidelines. We highlight cases of divergence between university testing plans and public health best practices, as well as potential bioethical issues.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"A.

While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine laboratory parameters are emerging, little is known about the impact of sex and age on these profiles. Methods: We performed multidimensional analysis of millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178,887 individuals, of which 33,266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These included complete blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and others. Results: COVID-19 induced more alterations in the laboratory parameters in males compared to females between 13 and 60 years old, in contrast to older individuals, where several parameters were altered by COVID-19 in both men and women. Biomarkers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, were increased especially in older men with COVID-19, whereas other markers such as abnormal liver function tests were common across several age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and eosinophils were also more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) displayed alterations in the coagulation system, and higher levels of neutrophils, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), among others. Discussion: Our study uncovers the laboratory profile of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients that underly discrepancies influenced by aging and biological sex. These profiles directly link COVID-19 disease presentation to an intricate interplay between sex, age and the immune response.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe ten-Caten","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Patricia Gonzalez-Dias","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Icaro Castro","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Ogava","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jeevan Giddaluru","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Juan CS Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Felipe Martins","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Andre NA Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Andre G Costa-Martins","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose D Araujo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana C Viegas","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sandra Farsky","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"D'Or institute for Research and Education"},{"author_name":"Anna S Levin","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Pia S Pannaraj","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Thushan I de Silva","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Paola Minoprio","author_inst":"Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Bezerril Andrade","author_inst":"FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"Fabiano P da Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Philippe R Bauer","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Janis E Blair","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nigel S Paneth","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"DeLisa Fairweather","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"R.

Salivary testing, the most convenient way to measure sIgA, has been used to characterize mucosal immune responses to many viral infections including SARS, MERS, influenza, HIV, and RSV. However, its role has not yet been characterized in the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report development and validation of a rapid immunoassay for measuring salivary IgA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and report quantitative results in both pre-COVID-19 and muco-converted subjects. Methods: We developed and refined a specific test for salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2 on the Brevitest platform, a rapid immunoassay system designed for point-of-care use. A qualitative test was validated as per FDA guidelines with saliva obtained from subjects prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We also generated a quantitative measure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA. Time taken for saliva self-collection was measured and its ease-of-use assessed. Results: We successfully validated a qualitative salivary assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies, with positive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respectively, and no observable cross-reactivity with any of seven potential confounders. Pre-COVID-19 saliva samples showed an 8-fold range of IgA concentrations, suggesting a broad continuum of natural antibody resistance against the novel virus, though at levels lower than that observed in COVID-19 PCR-confirmed subjects. Samples from muco-positive subjects also shown a ~9-fold variation in salivary IgA levels, with elevated salivary IgA observed beyond three months after onset of symptoms. We observed a correlation (r=0.4405) between salivary IgA levels and COVID-19 disease severity. In anecdotal observations, we observed individuals who exhibited antibodies early in the course of their disease, contemporaneously with a positive PCR test, as well as individuals who muco-converted despite no known direct exposure to a COVID-19 patient, no symptoms, and negative molecular and\/or serum antibody tests. Salivary collection took 5-10 minutes, and was reported as being easy (mean of 1.1 on a scale of 1 to 10). Implications: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA, plays an important role in host defense against respiratory pathogens, and our early data suggest it may do so in COVID-19. Salivary IgA, an accessible marker of mucosal immunity, may be a useful indicator of several key parameters including individual and community immune response, disease severity, clinical risk, and herd immunity. The non-invasive nature and ease of saliva collection facilitates its potential use as a biomarker for ongoing patient assessment and management, as well as a community surveillance tool. By measuring mucosal immune responses directly and systemic immune responses indirectly, salivary IgA could be useful in developing and deploying a vaccine(s) against COVID-19. Quantitative IgA assessment could also potentially serve as a tool to segment the population into different risk categories and inform individual and collective decisions relating to appropriate activities and vaccine prioritization\/delivery. These data reinforce the importance of further investigation into the role of mucosal immunity and IgA in host responses against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Atul Varadhachary","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Dev Chatterjee","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Javier Garza","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Robert Patrick Garr","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Christopher Foley","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Andrea Ford Letkeman","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"John Dean","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"David Haug","author_inst":"Arctas Capital Group"},{"author_name":"Juliet Breeze","author_inst":"Next Level Urgent Care"},{"author_name":"Robbyn Traylor","author_inst":"Next Level Urgent Care"},{"author_name":"Andrew Malek","author_inst":"Alchemy Industrial, LLC"},{"author_name":"Rohan Nath","author_inst":"APC Health, LLC"},{"author_name":"Leo Linbeck III","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"D'Or institute for Research and Education"},{"author_name":"Anna S Levin","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Pia S Pannaraj","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Thushan I de Silva","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Paola Minoprio","author_inst":"Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Bezerril Andrade","author_inst":"FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"Fabiano P da Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Philippe R Bauer","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Janis E Blair","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Nigel S Paneth","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"DeLisa Fairweather","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"R.

Covid-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 46,000 confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in prisoners hospitalized with Covid-19. Methods: An observational study of all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 10 and May 10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models were used to investigate primary outcomes. Results: Of the 706 hospitalized Covid-19 patients (mean age 66.7 +\/- 16.1 years, 57% males, and 44% black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9% vs. 18.7%), required vasopressors (24.1% vs. 9.9%), and intubated (25.0% vs. 15.2%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted inpatient mortality (29.6% vs. 20.1%) and 30-day mortality (34.3% vs. 24.6%). In the adjusted models, prisoner status was associated with higher in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07 to 3.57) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.98). Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized Covid-19 patients, prisoner status was associated with more severe clinical presentation, higher rates of ICU admissions, vasopressors requirement, intubation, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed M Altibi","author_inst":"Henry Ford Allegiance Health"},{"author_name":"Pallavi Bhargava","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Henry Ford Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hassan Liaqat","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Henry Ford Allegiance Hospital, Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Alexander A.

Disease progression, transmission, and clinical outcomes data were from published literature and national databases. We examined surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [Re] 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9). Costs were from a health care sector perspective; time horizon was 4 months. Setting & Participants: Simulated cohort of 2,258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston. Interventions: We assessed combinations of daily symptom screening with same-day polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of screen-positive individuals, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternate care sites [ACSs] for mild\/moderate COVID-19 management, and moving people from shelters to temporary housing, compared to no intervention. Main Outcomes: Infections, hospital-days, costs, and cost-effectiveness. Results: Compared to no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for those with pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild\/moderate disease leads to 37% fewer infections and 46% lower costs when Re=2.6, 75% fewer infections and 72% lower costs when Re=1.3, and 51% fewer infections and 51% lower costs when Re=0.9. Adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreases infections in all epidemic scenarios, with incremental cost per case prevented of $1,000 (Re=2.6), $27,000 (Re=1.3), and $71,000 (Re=0.9). In all scenarios, moving shelter residents to temporary housing with universal PCR testing every 2 weeks is most effective but substantially more costly than other options. Results are most sensitive to the cost and sensitivity of PCR testing and the efficacy of ACSs in preventing transmission. Conclusions & Relevance: Daily symptom screening and ACSs for sheltered homeless adults will substantially decrease COVID-19 cases and reduce costs compared to no intervention. In a surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreases cases at modest incremental cost and should be considered.

Increasingly, it is becoming clear that childcare centers must be (at least partially) operational in order to further mitigate the socially debilitating challenges related to pandemic induced closures. However, proposals to safely reopen childcare while limiting COVID-19 outbreaks remain understudied, and there is a pressing need for evidence-based scrutiny of the plans that are being proposed. Thus, in order to support safe childcare reopening procedures, the present study employed an agent-based modeling approach to generate predictions surrounding risk of COVID-19 infection and student-days lost within a hypothetical childcare center hosting 50 children and educators. Based on existing proposals for childcare and school reopening in Ontario, Canada, six distinct room configurations were evaluated that varied in terms of child-to-educator ratio (15:2, 8:2, 7:3), and family clustering (siblings together vs. random assignment). The results for the 15:2 random assignment configuration are relevant to early childhood education in Ontario primary schools, which require two educators per classroom. High versus low transmission rates were also contrasted, keeping with the putative benefit of infection control measures within centers, yielding a total of 12 distinct scenarios. Simulations revealed that the 7:3 siblings together configuration demonstrated the lowest risk, whereas centres hosting classrooms with more children (15:2) experienced 3 to 5 times as many COVID-19 cases. Across scenarios, having less students per class and grouping siblings together almost always results in significantly lower peaks for number of active infected and infectious cases in the institution. Importantly, the total student-days lost to classroom closure were between 5 and 8 times higher in the 15:2 ratios than for 8:2 or 7:3. These results suggest that current proposals for childcare reopening could be enhanced for safety by considering lower ratios and sibling groupings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brendon Phillips","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Dillon Browne","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Madhur Anand","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Chris Bauch","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Lynn Ly","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Stuart Reid","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Turner","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Sissel Juul","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Jessie Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program"},{"author_name":"Anne M.

This study aimed to provide data on demographics and clinical features of a hospitalized patient population who were confirmed with infection by our in-house (CDI) real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Methods We included consecutive patients who were admitted to Hackensack Meridian Health system hospitals with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 at Hackensack University Medical Center by the CDI virus test between March 12, 2020, and April 8, 2020. Clinical data and viral testing results were collected and analyzed for characteristics associated with outcomes, as well as the correlation with viral load. Results A total of 722 patients were included in the study, with a median age of 63 (interquartile range (IQR), 51-75) and 272 (37.7%) females. Mortality of this case series was 25.8%, with a statistically significant linear increase observed from age 40 to [&ge;]80 by 10-year intervals. Viral load, as indicated by the cycle of threshold (Ct) values from the RT-PCR test, was significantly higher in the oldest patient group ([&ge;]80), and inversely correlated with survival.

We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates. Ultimately, the number of excess COVID-19 cases produced by the evacuation depends on the ability of destination counties to meet evacuee needs while minimizing virus exposure through public health directives.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sen Pei","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Kristina A.
