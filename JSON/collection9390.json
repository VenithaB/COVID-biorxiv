In this report, we re-analyzed the computational approaches and findings presented in two recent manuscripts by Ji et al. (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/jmv.25682) and by Pradhan et al. (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/2020.01.30.927871), which concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions shared a unique similarity to HIV-1. Results from our re-implementation of the analyses, built on larger-scale datasets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, do not support the conclusions proposed by these manuscripts. Based on our analyses and existing data of coronaviruses, we concluded that the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV are more likely to be mammals and birds than snakes, and that the \"novel insertions\" observed in the spike protein are naturally evolved from bat coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chengxin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Huang","author_inst":"Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Eric W Bell","author_inst":"Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Xiaogen Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"contradictory results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.05.20020792","rel_title":"Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against introductions of 2019-nCoV","rel_date":"2020-02-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.05.20020792","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has spread to 23 countries from China. Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marius Gilbert","author_inst":"Universite Libre de Bruxelles"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Valdano","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Boelle","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric D'Ortenzio","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"INSERM, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Serge Paul Eholie","author_inst":"Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Treichville, Abidjan, Ivory Coast"},{"author_name":"Mathias Altmann","author_inst":"IDLIC, Bordeaux, France"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Moritz U.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Shanmeizi Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Zhiyao Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Yiping Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Surgery , Guangzhou women and Children's Medical Center , Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510623, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neonatology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Centre, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510623, China"},{"author_name":"Meng Lin","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Xu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Bing Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zuo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Zhanghua Chen","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Departments of Medical Biology and Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbou"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"},{"author_name":"Haibin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University, Gu"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.05.920009","rel_title":"A database resource for Genome-wide dynamics analysis of Coronaviruses on a historical and global scale","rel_date":"2020-02-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.05.920009","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak of a new zoonotic origin Coronavirus has ring the bell for the potential spread of epidemic Coronavirus crossing the species.

We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Boldog","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Tamas Tekeli","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Vizi","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Attila Denes","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Ferenc Bartha","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Gergely Rost","author_inst":"University of Szeged"},{"author_name":"Manyun Liu","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sylvia K.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yadi Zhou","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hou","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Shen","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yin Huang","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"William Martin","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Feixiong Cheng","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Manyun Liu","author_inst":"Georgia Southern University Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sylvia K.

Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings could explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiang He","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Qin Ran","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Anying Xiong","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Junyi Wang","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Dehong Wu","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Feng Chen","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Guoping Li","author_inst":"Chengdu Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Kimberlyn M.

Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shengjie Lai","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Nick Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Alexander Watts","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Xin Lu","author_inst":"National University of Defense Technology, Changsha"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Yang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"Bluedot"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"WorldPop, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Lone Simonsen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Cecile G.

This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000).

If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years.

We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jie Wu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jing Lu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenznen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Feng Ruan","author_inst":"Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lirong Zou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Haojie Zhong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingtao Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuguang Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiang Yu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiong Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xing Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuhuang Liao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenznen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Songjian Xiao","author_inst":"Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Nanshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingchao Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhuang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lijun Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huihong Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.01.20019984","rel_title":"Estimating the risk on outbreak spreading of 2019-nCoV in China using transportation data","rel_date":"2020-02-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.01.20019984","rel_abs":"A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hsiang-Yu Yuan","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"M.

Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, NIH"},{"author_name":"Jenny Chen","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, NIH, Bethesda MD USA"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, NIH, Bethesda MD USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhu","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Jia","author_inst":"Academic Information Center, China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Tzai-Hung Wen","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenznen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Feng Ruan","author_inst":"Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lirong Zou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Haojie Zhong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingtao Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuguang Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiang Yu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiong Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xing Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuhuang Liao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenznen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Songjian Xiao","author_inst":"Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Nanshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingchao Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhuang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lijun Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huihong Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.02.20020016","rel_title":"The incubation period of 2019-nCoV from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application","rel_date":"2020-02-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.02.20020016","rel_abs":"A novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in China in December, 2019.

ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Chai","author_inst":"Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University;

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gurjit S Randhawa","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Maximillian P.M.

In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Syed Faraz Ahmed","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmed A.

In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shen Lin","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Runnan Shen","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingdong He","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xinhao Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xushun Guo","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lila Kari","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Jian Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University;

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Huang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Herrmann","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin,"},{"author_name":"Jingdong He","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xinhao Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xushun Guo","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lila Kari","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Jian Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University;

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlie Diamond","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID nCoV working group","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nan Fang","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Jia Fan","author_inst":"Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University; Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invas"},{"author_name":"Jiabin Cai","author_inst":"Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University; Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invas"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Fei Lan","author_inst":"Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University; Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invas"},{"author_name":"Yingtao Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuguang Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianpeng Xiao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiang Yu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianxiong Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weilin Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xing Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuhuang Liao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenznen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Songjian Xiao","author_inst":"Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Nanshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yingchao Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhuang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lijun Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Siqing Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guanhao He","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peng Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huihong Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.01.30.20019844","rel_title":"Early evaluation of the Wuhan City travel restrictions in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak","rel_date":"2020-02-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.01.30.20019844","rel_abs":"Respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in China during December 2019. Attempting to contain infection, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January and implemented a national emergency response. Here we evaluate the spread and control of the epidemic based on a unique synthesis of data including case reports, human movement and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by an estimated 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29), delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China. Other cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported 33.3% (11.1-44.4%) fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks (13.0; 7.1-18.8) compared with cities that started control later (20.6; 14.5-26.8). Among interventions investigated here, the most effective were suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings. The national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic and, by 19 February (day 50), had averted hundreds of thousands of cases across China.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huaiyu Tian","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yidan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Chieh-Hsi Wu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bin Chen","author_inst":"University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Moritz U.
