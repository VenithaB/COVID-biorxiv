Interest exits concerning the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) in patients with Covid-19 disease. Objectives. To perform a systematic review on mortality associated to the use of ACEi in patients with Covid 19 disease. Methods. Search in Medline (PubMed), in ISI Web of Knowledge and in medRxiv database; use of other sources. Results. A total of 33 articles were evaluated. Concerning the papers used to produce the meta-analyses, seven studies were selected, five of which were used. These five studies involved a total number of 944 patients treated with ACEi and 5173 not treated with ACEi. Increased mortality was seen in association to the use of ACEi in the context of Covid-19 disease (ACEi users versus non-users; odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.15; P=0.04). When compared to mortality in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, mortality of patients treated with ACEi was not significantly different (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.21; P=0.74). Concerning the remaining reports, different types of data adjustments were used by several authors, after which increased mortality was not seen in association to the use of ACEi in this context. Conclusions. ACEi use could act as a marker of increased mortality risk in some but not all Covid-19 disease settings. The data now presented do not prove a causal relation but argue in favor of carrying out clinical trials studying ACEi in Covid-19 patients, in order to establish the safety of ACEi use in this context.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Pedro L.

The clinical and epidemiologic utilities of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 testing are under debate. Characterizing these assays helps to understand the disease and provides scientific basis for deciding how to best use these assays. The study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM\/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total Antibody Test). Validation included 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 1182 samples from negative controls with potential interferences\/cross-reactions, including 1063 pre-pandemic samples. IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as early as post-symptom onset days 3-4. IgG antibodies were first detected post-onset days 5-6 by SQ assays. The detection rates increased gradually, and SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total detected antibodies from all the PCR-confirmed patients 14 days after symptom onset. Overall agreements between SQ IgM\/IgG and Wondfo Total was 88.5% and between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG was 94.6% (Kappa = 0.75, 0.89). No cross-reaction with other endemic coronavirus infections were identified. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main cross-reactions observed. However, the interferences\/cross-reactions were low. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total and 99.62% for Abbott IgG and 98.87% for SQ IgM. These findings demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological seroprevalence studies.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaolei Lu","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Kimberly J Paiva","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Ricky D Grisson","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip A Chan","author_inst":"Rhode Island Department of Health"},{"author_name":"John Lonks","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ewa King","author_inst":"Rhode Island Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Richard C Huard","author_inst":"Rhode Island Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Diane L Pytel-Parenteau","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Ga Hie Nam","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Yakirevich","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Wei Chou","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Patrick O Byrne","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Christy K Hjorth","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nicole V Johnson","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"John Ludes-Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Annalee W Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Juyeon Park","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nianshuang Wang","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Amengor Dzifa","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jennifier A Maynard","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ilya J Finkelstein","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jason S McLellan","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117614","rel_title":"Assessing the quality, readability and reliability of online information on COVID-19: aninfoveillance observational study","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117614","rel_abs":"Objective: This study aimed to assess the quality, reliability and readability of internet-based information on COVID-19 available on Brazil most used search engines.

There are preliminary studies correlating qRT-PCR results from different materials to clinical outcomes, yet, comparability is limited due to the plethora of different assays used for diagnostics. In this study we evaluate clinical performance and linear range for the SARS-CoV-2 IVD (cobas6800\/8800 system, a fully automated sample-to-result platform) in different clinically relevant matrix materials outside official specifications. Methods: Assay performance was assessed in human plasma, BAL\/BL and transport medium following chemical inactivation. For analytical evaluation, respective matrix materials were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ten-fold dilution series. The efficacy of chemical inactivation by guanidine hydrochloride solution was confirmed in cell culture infectivity experiments. For correlation, a total of 235 predetermined clinical samples including respiratory swabs, plasma and BAL\/BL were subjected to the SARS-CoV-2 IVD test and results were compared. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD showed excellent linearity over five to seven log steps depending on matrix material. Chemical inactivation resulted in a reduction in plaque forming units of at least 3.5 log steps, while having no significant impact on assay performance. Inter-run consistency from three different testing sites demonstrated excellent comparability of RT-PCR results (maximum deviation was 1.53 CT). Clinical evaluation for respiratory swabs showed very good agreement with the comparator assay (Positive agreement 95.7%, negative agreement 98.9%).

Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, and IL-1{beta} in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF- serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF- levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF- levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diane Marie Del Valle","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Seunghee Kim-schulze","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Huang Hsin-hui","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Noam D Beckmann","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nirenberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yonit Lavin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Talia Swartz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aryeh Stock","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marron","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hui Xie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Manish Kumar Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Oliver van Oekelen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric Schadt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Madhu Mazumdar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115691","rel_title":"Intensive COVID-19 testing associated with reduced mortality - an ecological analysis of 108 countries","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115691","rel_abs":"Background Intensive screening and testing for COVID-19 could facilitate early detection and isolation of infected persons and thereby control the size of the epidemic.

Conclusions The results are compatible with the hypothesis that intensive testing and isolation could play a role in reducing COVID-10 mortality rates.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chris Kenyon","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Seunghee Kim-schulze","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Huang Hsin-hui","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Noam D Beckmann","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nirenberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yonit Lavin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Talia Swartz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aryeh Stock","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marron","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hui Xie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Manish Kumar Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Oliver van Oekelen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric Schadt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Madhu Mazumdar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115659","rel_title":"Future scenarios for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland: an age-structured model","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115659","rel_abs":"The recent lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions in Switzerland causes uncertainty about the future of the epidemic.

The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza patients.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip A Mudd","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Chase Crawford","author_inst":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jackson S Turner","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aisha Souquette","author_inst":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Reynolds","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diane Bender","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James P.

Methods: In 2020, we developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination. Results: Simulation experiments revealed that when vaccine efficacy exceeded 70%, coverage exceeded 60%, and vaccination occurred on day 1, the attack rate dropped to 22% with daily cases not exceeding 3.2 million (reproductive rate, R0, 2.5). When R0 was 3.5, the attack rate dropped to 41% with daily cases not exceeding 14.4 million. Increasing coverage to 75% when vaccination occurred by day 90 resulted in 5% attack rate and daily cases not exceeding 258,029when R0 was 2.5 and a 26% attack rate and maximum daily cases of 22.6 million when R0 was 3.5. When vaccination did not occur until day 180, coverage (i.e., those vaccinated plus those otherwise immune) had to reach 100%. A vaccine with an efficacy between 40% and 70% could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher, and in some cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages. Conclusion: Our study found that to either prevent or largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing), the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70%.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah M Bartsch","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Kelly J O'Shea","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Marie C Ferguson","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Maria-Elena Bottazzi","author_inst":"National School of Tropical Medicine and Departments of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarah N Cox","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Strych","author_inst":"National School of Tropical Medicine and Departments of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James A McKinnell","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Clinical Outcomes Research Unit (ID-CORE), Lundquist Institute, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Patrick T.

Several drugs are now being repurposed with the aim of identifying if these drugs provide some level of disease resolution. Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), first developed as an antimalarial therapy. There is increasing concern with regards to the efficacy and safety of these agents. The aims of this review are to systematically identify and collate studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Methods and Findings: Searches for (COVID AND chloroquine [title\/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) and two (COVID AND hydroxychloroquine[title\/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) yielded 272 unique articles. Unique articles were manually checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria and also subjected to a quality appraisal assessment. A total of 19 articles were included in the systematic review. Seventy-five percent of observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy recorded no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes, between COVID-19 patients given a range of CQ and\/or HCQ doses, and the control groups. All clinical trials and 82% of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Seventy-five percent of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects found a greater incidence among patients administered a wide range of CQ and\/or HCQ doses, with QTc prolongation the most common finding, in addition to its consequences of VT and cardiac arrest. Of the total studies using mortality rate as an end-point, 60% reported no significant change in the risk of death, while 30% showed an elevation, and 10% a depression, in treated relative to control patients. Conclusion: The strongest available evidence suggests that, relative to standard in-hospital management of symptoms, the use of CQ and HCQ to treat hospitalised COVID-19 patients has likely been unsafe. At the very least, the poor quality of data failing to find any significant changes in the risk of VT should preclude definitive judgment on drug safety until the completion of high-quality randomised clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Micheal takla","author_inst":"Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kamalan Jeevaratnam","author_inst":"Surrey"},{"author_name":"Francisco Santos-Schneider","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Laurence Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Julien Espeut","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Mellis Alali","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Julie Baptiste","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Lise Cardeur","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115311","rel_title":"A survey of the psychological status of primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Hangzhou China","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115311","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate the presence of social anxiety and depression and the risk factors for them among primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hangzhou China.

Deterioration of the parent-child relationship, less physical activity, irregular work and rest, and negative mood during home quarantine were significant risk factors for depression. Conclusion: Primary school students who were quarantined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic were more likely to have social anxiety but less likely to have depressive symptoms. Poor parent-child relationships, irregularity of work and rest, and epidemic-related problems were the main reasons for psychological problems. Families, schools, and social organizations need to pay more attention to the psychological status of primary school students quarantined at home.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanghao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Li","author_inst":"The Affiliated Xiaoshan First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University"},{"author_name":"Maiyan Zhang","author_inst":"Beigan primary school of Xiaoshan District"},{"author_name":"Bicheng Jin","author_inst":"Greentown Yuhua Primary School of Hangzhou"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Li","author_inst":"Beigan primary school of Xiaoshan District"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Cao","author_inst":"Greentown Yuhua Primary School of Hangzhou"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Changzhong Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117457","rel_title":"Emotional distress and associated sociodemographic risk factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117457","rel_abs":"Background Spain is one of the countries that has been most affected by COVID-19 disease. However, the emotional distress on the Spanish population remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of emotional disorders and related symptoms and to assess the influence of sociodemographic characteristics on this population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey using an online platform. Participation was completely voluntary. Sociodemographic variables were collected and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic were assessed through three questionnaires: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-Panic Disorder (PHQ-PD). Chi-squared statistics were applied to determine the influence of sociodemographic variables on symptom severity and diagnosis. Results Most respondents (n=1753) were female (76.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 (12.9) years; 39.1% were married and 39.5% held a high school degree. Severe and moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression were high (6.5% and 14.3%; 9.9% and 12.9%, respectively) and more than one in four participants (25.7%) experienced a panic attack. A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD; 12.2% for MDD; and 17.2% for PD. Significant risk factors were as follows: female, young adult, single, unemployed, and low income. Conclusion Due to limitations related to the study design (convenience sample), the findings of these study may not be applicable to the general population. Nonetheless, the high prevalence of emotional symptoms and disorders in this sample suggests that mental health interventions are urgently needed in Spain.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roger Munoz-Navarro Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Psychology and Sociology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences University of Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Cano-Vindel Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Experimental Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, Complutense University of Madrid"},{"author_name":"Florian Schmitz Sr.","author_inst":"Institute of Psychology, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Rosario Cabello Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Developmental and Educational Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Granada"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez-Berrocal Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Basic Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Malaga"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Cao","author_inst":"Greentown Yuhua Primary School of Hangzhou"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Changzhong Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117564","rel_title":"Prevalence and acceptance of glove wearing practice among general population when visiting high risk are during local COVID-19 outbreak .","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117564","rel_abs":"Background Healthcare authorities have generally advised against wearing glove by the general population. However, the use of gloves has become a common sight in public places raising the question of the necessity of glove wearing practice by the general population Objective This study aims to investigate the prevalence and types of glove used as well as the acceptance of the glove practice by individuals visiting the high-risk area during Covid-19 pandemic. Setting This prospective observational study was conducted among individuals visiting a wet market and district specialist hospital During Covid-19 pandemic. The required data was recorded based on observation by trained data collectors who were stationed at the strategic entry point. Methods Individuals entering through dedicated entry point were observed for the type, category and practice of wearing personal protective equipment. Inclusion criteria for this study were any individuals entering the facilities from entry points without respiratory symptoms. Exclusion criteria for this study were individuals less than 2 years old, visiting the emergency department, facility staff, individuals who are suspected of multiple entry and individuals who are exiting the treatment facility entrance. Patients were categorized into two groups of acceptable and unacceptable glove practice. The Pearson chi-square was used to test for differences in investigated variables in the univariate setting. Main outcome measure Prevalence, acceptance of glove wearing practice. Results A total of 75 individuals (2.3%) compromising of 45 (60.0%) individuals from hospitals and 30 (40.0%) individuals from wet markets were seen wearing glove amongst 3322 individuals observed during the data collection period. A higher proportion of individuals visiting wet market (30.0%) were observed with unacceptable glove practice compared to individuals visiting the hospital (8.9%), {chi}2 (1) = 5.60, p=.018. Similarly, a Higher proportion of glove use among non-Malay (53.3%) compared to Malay (46.7%) was observed in hospital compared to a higher proportion of glove use among Malay compared to non-Malay (16.7%) visiting wet market, {chi}2 (1) = 10.20, p=.001. As for glove use, we found that male were using more medical-grade glove (78.8%) compared to non-medical grade glove (21.2%) while an equal amount of medical (50.0%) and non-medical grade glove (50.0%) was used among female, {chi}2 (1) = 6.546, p=.011. Besides, we found that higher proportion of individual using medical-grade glove was using medical grade facemask (68.3%) which was similar to the proportion of individuals using non-medical glove was using non-medical facemask (66.7%), {chi}2 (1) = 5.25, p=.022. Conclusion We present the prevalence and characteristics of glove wearing practice in high-risk location during the current COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. Facing a worldwide public health emergency with limited effective clinical treatment, the role of glove-wearing in mitigating COVID-19 transmission is questionable. If needed, the compliance to proper glove-wearing could be improved through targeted public health education","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gobi Hariyanayagam Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sera Selvanthan Sundram Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shargunan Selvanthan Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Fouzia Hanim Abdul Halim","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nor Amirah abdul halim","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nur Syafina Insyirah Zaimi","author_inst":"Ministry of health ,Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Changzhong Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20117390","rel_title":"Trend analysis, modelling and impact assessment of COVID-19 in Nepal","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20117390","rel_abs":"With continued global expansion of COVID-19 transmission and mounting threat of the disease, the timely analysis of its trend in Nepal and forecasting the potential situation in the country has been deemed necessary. We analyzed the trend, modelling and impact assessment of COVID-19 cases of Nepal from 23rd January 2020 to 30th April 2020 to portray the scenario of COVID-19 after the first phase of lockdown. Exponential smoothing state-space and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were constructed to forecast the cases. Susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was fit to estimate the basic reproduction number (Ro) of COVID-19 in Nepal. There has been increase in the number of cases but the overall growth in COVID-19 was not high. Statistical modelling has shown that COVID-19 cases may continue to increase exponentially in Nepal. The basic reproduction number in Nepal being maintained at low level of 1.08 for the period of 23rd January to 30th April 2020 is an indication of effectiveness of lockdown in containing the COVID-19 spread. The models further suggest that COVID-19 might persist until December 2020 with peak cases in August 2020. On the other hand, basic reproduction number of 1.25 was computed for total cases reported for the 22nd March to 30th April 2020 period implying that COVID-19 may remain for at least for a year in the country. Thus, maintaining social distance and stay home policy with an implementation of strict lockdown in COVID-19 affected district is highly recommended.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shital Bhandary","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, Lalitpur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Srijan Lal Shrestha","author_inst":"Central Department of Statistics, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ram Prasad Khatiwada","author_inst":"Central Department of Statistics, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Deep Narayan Shah","author_inst":"Central Department of Environmental Science, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Nabin Narayan Munankarmi","author_inst":"Biotechnology Society Nepal (BSN), Bhaktapur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Megha Raj Banjara","author_inst":"Central Department of Microbiology, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Resham Thapa-Parajuli","author_inst":"Central Department of Economics, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Krishna Das Manandhar","author_inst":"Central Department of Biotechnology, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Rameshwar Adhikari","author_inst":"Research Center for Applied Science and Technology, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Reshma Tuladhar","author_inst":"Tribhuvan University"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20116277","rel_title":"QMRA of SARS-CoV-2 for workers in wastewater treatment plants","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20116277","rel_abs":"Faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a hot topic and additional research is needed to elucidate the risks of the novel coronavirus in sanitation systems.

A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is applied for three COVID-19 scenarios (moderate, aggressive and extreme) to study the effect of different stages of the pandemic, in terms of percentage of infected population, on the probability of infection. Results reveal that estimates of viral loads in sewage at the entrance of WWTPs ranged from 1.03x102 to 1.31x104 GC.mL-1 (0.1 to 13.06 PFU.mL-1, respectively) and that estimated risks for the aggressive and extreme scenarios (6.5x10-3 and 3.1x10-2, respectively) were likely to be above a WHO benchmark of tolerable risk used for virus infection of 10-3 and higher than the risk of infection of E. coli, used herein as common pathogen indicator for a relative comparison, thus reinforcing the concern of sewage systems as a transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2.

The objective of this work is to analyze potential correlation between visual quantification of lesion severity at initial chest CT and clinical outcome in confirmed Covid-19 patients. Materials and Methods From March 5 th to March 21 st , 2020, all consecutive patients that underwent chest CT for clinical suspicion of Covid-19 at a single tertiary center were retrospectively evaluated for inclusion. Patients with lung parenchyma lesions compatible with Covid- 19 and positive RT-PCR were included. Global extensiveness of abnormal lung parenchyma was visually estimated and classified independently by 2 readers, following the European Society of Thoracic Imaging Guidelines. Death and\/or mechanical ventilation within 30 days following the initial chest CT was chosen as the primary hard endpoint. Results 216 patients (124 men, 62 years-old, range 22 ; 94 yo) corresponding to 216 chest CT were included. Correlation between lesion severity and percentage of patients that met the primary endpoint was high, with a coefficient p; of 0.87 (p = 0.05). A greater than 25% involvement was significantly associated with a higher risk of mechanical ventilation or death at 30 days, with a Risk Ratio of 5.00 (95% CI [3.59- 6.99]). Conclusion This retrospective cohort confirms a correlation between visual evaluation of lesions severity at initial chest CT and the 30 days clinical outcome of Covid-19 patients and suggests using a threshold of greater than 25% involvement to identify patients at risk.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elias Taieb","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aissam Labani","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Yvon Ruch","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Francois Danion","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Oberlin","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pascal Bilbault","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Leyendecker","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Catherine Roy","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Mickael Ohana","author_inst":"Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Beata Sk\u00f3rko","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Sarvin Es haghi","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Kristina Almazidou","author_inst":"Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Luis Rodr\u00edguez-Pino","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"A.

To investigate introduction and understand the early transmission dynamics of the virus, we formed the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance of COVID (SANGS_COVID), a network of ten government and university laboratories. Here, we present the first results of this effort, which is a molecular epidemiological study of the first twenty-one SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes sampled in the first port of entry, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), during the first month of the epidemic. By combining this with calculations of the effective reproduction number (R), we aim to shed light on the patterns of infections that define the epidemic in South Africa. Methods: R was calculated using positive cases and deaths from reports provided by the four major provinces. Molecular epidemiology investigation involved sequencing viral genomes from patients in KZN using ARCTIC protocols and assembling whole genomes using meticulous alignment methods. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian trees, lineage classification and molecular clock calculations. Findings: The epidemic in South Africa has been very heterogeneous. Two of the largest provinces, Gauteng, home of the two large metropolis Johannesburg and Pretoria, and KwaZulu-Natal, home of the third largest city in the country Durban, had a slow growth rate on the number of detected cases. Whereas, Western Cape, home of Cape Town, and the Eastern Cape provinces the epidemic is spreading fast. Our estimates of transmission potential for South Africa suggest a decreasing transmission potential towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths have been reported. However, between 06 May and 18 May 2020, we estimate that R was on average 1.39 (1.04 - 2.15, 95% CI). We also demonstrate that early transmission in KZN, and most probably in all main regions of SA, was associated with multiple international introductions and dominated by lineages B1 and B. The study also provides evidence for locally acquired infections in a hospital in Durban within the first month of the epidemic, which inflated early mortality in KZN. Interpretation: This first report of SANGS_COVID consortium focuses on understanding the epidemic heterogeneity and introduction of SARS-CoV-2 strains in the first month of the epidemic in South Africa. The early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in KZN included caused a localized outbreak in a hospital, provides potential explanations for the initially high death rates in the province. The current high rate of transmission of COVID-19 in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape highlights the crucial need to strength local genomic surveillance in South Africa.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Giandhari","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Sureshnee Pillay","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Eduan Wilkinson","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Houriiyah Tegally","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Ilya Sinayskiy","author_inst":"Quantum Research Group, School of Chemistry and Physics, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Maria Schuld","author_inst":"Quantum Research Group, School of Chemistry and Physics, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Chimukangara","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu Natal"},{"author_name":"Richard John Lessells","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Yunus Moosa","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Inbal Gazy","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Maryam Fish","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Lavanya Singh","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Khulekani Sedwell Khanyile","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Vagner Fonseca","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Francesco Petruccione","author_inst":"Quantum Research Group, School of Chemistry and Physics, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Tulio de Oliveira","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal"},{"author_name":"Zofia Bara\u0144czuk - Turska","author_inst":"Institute of Mathematics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Zeeshan Haq","author_inst":"Texas Behavioral Health, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Salah U Qureshi","author_inst":"Texas Behavioral Health, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Ali Jawaid","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Neural Plasticity and Brain Disorders (Braincity), Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland, Department of Neurology, U"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.120402","rel_title":"Genomic analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 strains introduced in Mexico","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.120402","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected most countries in the world. Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to implement effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A\/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B\/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described in the country. Within this Mexican cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country. Our results depict the general picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants introduced at the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico, setting the foundation for future surveillance efforts.\n\nThis work is the result of the collaboration of five institutions into one research consortium: three public health institutes and two universities. From the beginning of this work, it was agreed that the experimental leader of each institution would share the first authorship. Those were the criteria followed to assign first co-first authorship in this manuscript. The order of the other authors was randomly assigned.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding the introduction, spread and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 within distinct human populations is crucial to implement effective control strategies as well as the evolution of the pandemics. In this work, we describe that the initial virus strains introduced in Mexico came from Europe and the United States and the virus was circulating locally in the country as early as mid-March. We also found evidence for early local transmission of strains having the mutation H49Y in the Spike protein, that could be further used as a molecular marker to follow viral spread within the country and the region.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Blanca Taboada","author_inst":"Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Joel A.

It has been recommended that medical students work as volunteers, have appropriate training, do not undertake any activity beyond their level of competence, have continuous supervision and adequate personal protective equipment. However, motivation of medical students must be evaluated in order to make volunteering a more evidence-based initiative. The aim of our study was to evaluate motivation of medical students to be part of the health team to help in the COVID19 pandemic. Methods and Findings: We developed a questionnaire specifically to evaluate medical students perceptions about participating in care of patients with suspected infection due to coronavirus during the COVID19 pandemic. The questionnaire had two parts: a) individual characteristics, year and geographic location of medical school; b) twenty eight statements responded on a 5 point Likert scale (totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree). To develop the questionnaire, we performed consensus meetings of a group of faculty and medical students. The questionnaire was sent to student organizations of 257 medical schools in Brazil and answered by 10,433 students. We used multinomial logistic regression models to analyse the data. Statements with greater odds ratios for participation of medical students in COVID19 pandemic were related to sense of purpose or duty (It is the duty of the medical student to put himself at the service of the population in the pandemic), altruism (I am willing to take risks by participating in practical in the context of pandemic), perception of good performance and professional identity (I will be a better health professional for having experienced the pandemic). Males had higher odds ratios than females (1.36 [95% CI: 1.24 to 1.49] to 1.68 [95% CI: 1.47 to 1.91]). Conclusions: Medical students are motivated by sense of purpose or duty, altruism, perception of good performance and values of professionalism more than their interest in learning. These results have implications in the developing of programs of volunteering and in the design of health force policies in the present pandemic and in future health emergencies.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricia Tempski","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernanda M Arantes-Costa","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Renata Kobayasi","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marina AM Siqueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Matheus M Torsani","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bianca QRC Amaro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Roraima"},{"author_name":"Maria Eduarda FM Nascimento","author_inst":"Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Saulo L Siqueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Itamar S Santos","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Milton A Martins","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Becerril-Vargas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cos\u00edo Villegas,"},{"author_name":"Jorge Salas-Hern\u00e1ndez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cos\u00edo Villegas,"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Grande","author_inst":"Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Carolina Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Francisco J.

Methods: A model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber was used. Three-port 25 gauge vitrectomy simulated surgery was performed with any visible aerosol production recorded using high speed 4K camera. The following were assessed: (1) vitrector at maximum cut rate in static and dynamic conditions inside the model, (2) vitrector at air-fluid interface in physical model, (3) passive fluid-air exchange with a backflush hand piece, (4) valved cannulas under air, and (5) defective valved cannula under air. Results: No visible aerosol or droplets were identified when the vitrector was used within the model. In the physical model, no visible aerosol or droplets were seen when the vitrector was engaged at the air-fluid interface. Droplets were produced from the opening of backflush hand piece during passive fluid-air exchange. No visible aerosol was produced from the intact valved cannulas under air pressure, but droplets were seen at the beginning of fluid-air exchange when the valved cannula was defective.

Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, assessed using a lateral flow rapid test, varied markedly across the cities and regions, from below 1% in most cities in the South and Center-West regions to up to 25% in the city of Breves in the Amazon (North) region. Eleven of the 15 cities with the highest seroprevalence were located in the North, including the six cities with highest prevalence which were located along a 2,000 km stretch of the Amazon river. Overall seroprevalence for the 90 cities with sample size of 200 or greater was 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.6). Extrapolating this figure to the population of these cities, which represent 25% of the country population, led to an estimate of 760,000 cases, as compared to the 104,782 cases reported in official statistics. Seroprevalence did not vary significantly between infancy and age 79 years, but fell by approximately two-thirds after age 80 years. Prevalence was highest among indigenous people (3.7%) and lowest among whites (0.6%), a difference which was maintained when analyses were restricted to the North region, where most indigenous people live. Our results suggest that pandemic is highly heterogenous, with rapid escalation in the North and Northeast, and slow progression in the South and Center-West regions.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Horta","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Gabriel D Victora","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Mariangela Silveira","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Claudio Struchiner","author_inst":"UERJ"},{"author_name":"Luis Paulo Vidaletti","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Nelson Neumann","author_inst":"Pastoral da Crianca"},{"author_name":"Lucia C Pellanda","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Marcelo N Burattini","author_inst":"UNIFESP"},{"author_name":"Ana M Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Aluisio J Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Gloria V\u00e1zquez","author_inst":"Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Francisco Pulido","author_inst":"Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Adnan Araiza-Rodr\u00edguez","author_inst":"Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Garc\u00e9s-Ayala","author_inst":"Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9sar R.

Therefore, we undertook this study to determine the association between poor housing condition and COVID19 incidence and mortality in US counties. Methods: We conducted cross sectional analysis of county level data from the US Centers for Disease Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3141 US counties. The exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or more of: overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID19 across US counties through 4\/21\/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling was utilized with adjustment for population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state level COVID19 test density. Results: Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7%, 60.2%). The mean (SD) incidence and mortality of COVID19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. In the fully adjusted models, with each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there was a 50% higher risk of COVID19 incidence (IRR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38,1.62) and a 42% higher risk of COVID19 mortality (MRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.25,1.61). Results remained similar using earlier timepoints (3\/31\/2020 and 4\/10\/2020). Conclusions and Relevance: Counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID19. These findings suggest targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions should be considered in further efforts to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khansa Ahmad","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Sebhat Erqou","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Nishant Shah","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Umair Nazir","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Alan Morrison","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Choudhary","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Wen-Chih Wu","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Nelson Neumann","author_inst":"Pastoral da Crianca"},{"author_name":"Lucia C Pellanda","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Marcelo N Burattini","author_inst":"UNIFESP"},{"author_name":"Ana M Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Aluisio J Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Gloria V\u00e1zquez","author_inst":"Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Francisco Pulido","author_inst":"Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"},{"author_name":"Adnan Araiza-Rodr\u00edguez","author_inst":"Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Garc\u00e9s-Ayala","author_inst":"Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9sar R.

However, it is still largely unknown how effective different NPIs are at reducing transmission. Data-driven studies can estimate the effectiveness of NPIs while minimizing assumptions, but existing analyses lack sufficient data and validation to robustly distinguish the effects of individual NPIs. Methods: We collect chronological data on NPIs in 41 countries between January and May 2020, using independent double entry by researchers to ensure high data quality. We estimate NPI effectiveness with a Bayesian hierarchical model, by linking NPI implementation dates to national case and death counts. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most thoroughly validated data-driven study of NPI effectiveness to date. Results: We model each NPI's effect as a multiplicative (percentage) reduction in the reproduction number R. We estimate the mean reduction in R across the countries in our data for eight NPIs: mandating mask-wearing in (some) public spaces (2%; 95% CI: -14%-16%), limiting gatherings to 1000 people or less (2%; -20%-22%), to 100 people or less (21%; 1%-39%), to 10 people or less (36%; 16%-53%), closing some high-risk businesses (31%; 13%-46%), closing most nonessential businesses (40%; 22%-55%), closing schools and universities (39%; 21%-55%), and issuing stay-at-home orders (18%; 4%-31%). These results are supported by extensive empirical validation, including 15 sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, by implementing effective NPIs, many countries can reduce R below 1 without issuing a stay-at-home order. We find a surprisingly large role for school and university closures in reducing COVID-19 transmission, a contribution to the ongoing debate about the relevance of asymptomatic carriers in disease spread. Banning gatherings and closing high-risk businesses can be highly effective in reducing transmission, but closing most businesses only has limited additional benefit.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Markus Brauner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"S\u00f6ren Mindermann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mrinank Sharma","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna B Stephenson","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Tom\u00e1\u0161 Gaven\u010diak","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"David Johnston","author_inst":"Australia National University"},{"author_name":"Gavin Leech","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"John Salvatier","author_inst":"Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute"},{"author_name":"George Altman","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Alexander John Norman","author_inst":"No affiliation"},{"author_name":"Joshua Teperowski Monrad","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tamay Besiroglu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hong Ge","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Mikulik","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Meghan A.

We have considered the data outside China because we are going to study the data starting from March 21, and by that time the spread had almost come to a stop in China. We have used for our analysis data on total cases outside China till April 25, 2020, and data from April 26 to April 30 for comparison of forecasts and observed values. Right from the beginning the spread pattern was nonlinear, and by the end of the third week of March the nonlinearity became nearly exponential. The exponential pattern thereafter has changed by around March 28, April 5, April 11 and April 18. Since March 21, the spread is following a nearly exponential pattern of growth changing observably at almost regular intervals of seven days. It is but natural that at some point of time the countries that had been contributing in observably large numbers to the total cases would start to show diminishing growth patterns. Therefore long term forecasts using our method would give us slightly overestimated results. However, for short term forecasting our simple method does work very well when we consider the total number of cases in the world and not in any particular country.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hemanta Kumar Baruah","author_inst":"The Assam Royal Global University"},{"author_name":"S\u00f6ren Mindermann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mrinank Sharma","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna B Stephenson","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Tom\u00e1\u0161 Gaven\u010diak","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"David Johnston","author_inst":"Australia National University"},{"author_name":"Gavin Leech","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"John Salvatier","author_inst":"Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute"},{"author_name":"George Altman","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Alexander John Norman","author_inst":"No affiliation"},{"author_name":"Joshua Teperowski Monrad","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tamay Besiroglu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hong Ge","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Mikulik","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Meghan A.
