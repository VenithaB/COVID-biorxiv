The estimation of its value with respect to the key threshold of 1.0 is a measure of the need, and eventually effectiveness, of interventions imposed in various countries. Here we present an online tool for the data driven inference and quantification of uncertainties for R0 as well as the time points of interventions for 51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple and well established SIR model with data from reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present a publicly available GUI (https:\/\/www.cse-lab.ethz.ch\/coronavirus\/) that allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease's spread suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. They also serve to demonstrate how geographic proximity and related times of interventions can lead to similarities in the progression of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Petr Karnakov","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Georgios Arampatzis","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Ivica Ki\u010di\u0107","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Fabian Wermelinger","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Daniel W\u00e4lchli","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Costas Papadimitriou","author_inst":"University of Thessaly"},{"author_name":"Petros Koumoutsakos","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20109298","rel_title":"P0: Progress to zero: A simple metric to measure COVID-19 progress by country\/region","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20109298","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on the world. As of May 8th, 2020, more than half of the world is in lockdown, 3.6 million people have been infected, and over 250,000 of them have died. This is the first pandemic in human history that has been tracked on a daily basis across the world. Currently, progress is being tracked by a series of metrics, including new cases, deaths, and the effective reproduction number over time (R(t)), which epidemiologists have emphasized. While it is an important measure, R(t) is not observable and is dependent on the absolute number of active cases; therefore, two geographies could have a similar R(t) but be having very different experiences. Here, we propose a metric to monitor progress on addressing the COVID pandemic that we name \"progress to zero\" or P0. P0 corresponds to the percentage decline from a previously recorded peak level. The metric ranges from 0% (representing a geography that has not yet peaked) to 100% (representing a geography wherein 0 cases have been recorded for at least seven days). Our metric helps leaders focus on progress to a desired goal, easily can be tracked over time, can quickly identify retreat from progress, and is comparable across geographies regardless of their size.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan M Lavista Ferres","author_inst":"Microsoft"},{"author_name":"Ruth B Etzioni","author_inst":"Fred Hutch"},{"author_name":"William B.

Model the effect of partial and full reversal of containment measures on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Ecuador. Methods. Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 before and after the implementation (and reversal) of containment measures. A Healthcare Compartmental Epidemic Model (HeCEM), which accounts for Hospital and Intensive Care Unit admission rates, was developed to also simulate the effect of reversing social distancing containment measures. Reported COVID-19 cases between February 29th and April 23rd, 2020 were obtained from the Servicio Nacional de Gesti&oacuten de Riesgos y Emergencia, the national emergency management office of Ecuador. An ARIMA model was used to forecast reported number of cases based on the reported number of cases. SIR, HeCEM, and ARIMA model prediction errors were estimated. Results. SIR and HeCEM models predict that, at the moment, hospital and ICU bed needs for COVID-19 patients exceed the capacity in Ecuador. Partial or full reversal of containment measures before reaching the point where hospital and ICU beds are enough to meet the expected demand will result in secondary waves that delay reaching this equilibrium, resulting in thousands of excess deaths. Forecasts predict over 50,000 reported COVID-19 cases by July 25th, 2020. Conclusion. Partial reversal of containment measures should occur only after enough hospital and beds are available to meet the demand.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Reina Ortiz","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Vinita Sharma","author_inst":"The University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"William B.

Methods: A longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution March 1-April 19 2020 for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance (N = 13,934). Results: From March 1st to April 19, 2020 age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19\/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p <.001).

Method:This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers, which reported available findings on the association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection. We used the STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Result:In this present meta-analysis, 52 papers, including 8,463 COVID-19 patients, were studied. The prevalence of increased liver enzymes among the patients, including Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, were 30% and 21% in non-severe patients, respectively, which were 38% and 48% in severe patients. The prevalence of increasing C-reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and Bilirubin were 55%, 39%, 28%, and 10% in non-severe patients respectively, which were 78%, 75%, 79% and 17% in sever patients.The prevalence of liver toxicity as a complication of COVID-19 was 20%.Also patients who have severe condition are 5.54, 4.22, 4.96, 4.13 and 4.34 times more likely to have elevated CRP, ALT, AST, LDH, D-dimer enzymes retrospectively.

Although efficacy have not been proven, lopinavir\/ritonavir 400 mg\/100 mg twice daily has been proposed as a treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19. Previously published cohorts showed Covid-19 is associated with major inflammation. To date, no data are available regarding lopinavir\/ritonavir plasma concentration and its safety in Covid-19 patients. Methods: Real-world Covid-19 experience based on a retrospective cohort study Results: On the cohort of 31 patients treated by lopinavir\/ritonavir for Covid-19, we observed very high lopinavir plasma concentrations, increased of 4.6-fold (IQR 2.9-6.4), with regards to average plasma concentrations in HIV treatment. All except two patients were above the upper limit of the concentration ranges of HIV treatment. In this cohort, about one over four to five patients prematurely stopped lopinavir\/ritonavir therapy due to a moderate adverse drug reaction, mainly hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusion: Patients with Covid-19 pneumonitis treated with lopinavir\/ritonavir have plasma concentrations dramatically higher than expected. Owing to that high plasma concentration may be required for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, it appears that lopinavir dosage should not be reduced in the absence of adverse effect. About 80% of the patients well tolerated lopinavir\/ritonavir therapy under these plasma concentrations. However, cautious is necessary as drug repurposing can be associated with a new drug safety profile.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laurent Chouchana","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sana Boujaafar","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Ines Gana","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Laure-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Preta","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Lucile Regard","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Paul Legendre","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Celia Azoulay","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Canou\u00ef","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Zerbit","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104794","rel_title":"Epidemiology of sleep disorders during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic scoping review protocol","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104794","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impacting human health globally. In addition to physical health problems, a growing burden of mental health problems has become a global concern amid this pandemic. Sleep disorders are major mental health problems associated with increased psychosocial stressors; however, no research synthesis is available on the epidemiology of sleep disorders. In this systematic scoping review, we aim to assess the current evidence on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature on sleep disorders. Methods: We will search seven major health databases and additional sources to identify, evaluate, and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available interventions addressing the same. We will use the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review and report the findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Conclusion: This review will identify the epidemiological burden of and interventions for sleep disorders. The findings of this review will be widely communicated with the research and professional community to facilitate future research and practice.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samia Tasnim","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, TX 77843, USA."},{"author_name":"Mariya Rahman","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, TX 77843, USA."},{"author_name":"Priyanka Pawar","author_inst":"Mamta Foundation, India."},{"author_name":"Liye Zou","author_inst":"School of Psychology, Shenzhen University, China."},{"author_name":"Abida Sultana","author_inst":"Nature Study Society of Bangladesh, Khulna, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"E.

To examine the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in the sample and the relation between PCR and antibody test results. design: cross-sectional and (retrospective) cohort study setting: a nursing home for the elderly Bessemerberg in Lanaken (Belgium) with up to 130 beds. Lanaken is situated in the Belgian province with the highest COVID-19 prevalence. participants: residents (N=108) and staff members (N=93) of the nursing home outcomes: PCR, IgM and IgG results: the prevalence of COVID-19, based on PCR test was 34% (N=40) for residents and 13% (N=11) for staff members, respectively. Of the residents, 13% showed positive IgM results and 15% positive IgG results. In 17% of the residents, at least one of the antibodies was positive. In total 13% of the staff members had positive IgM and 16% had a positive IgG. In 20% of the staff members at least one of these antibody tests was positive. In PCR positive residents, the percentage of IgM positive, IgG positive, and at least one of both was 28%, 34%, and 41%. In PCR positive staff, we found 30%, 60%, and 60%. Additional antibody tests were performed in nine residents between day 11 and 14 after the positive PCR test. Of those, 7 (78%) tested positive on at least one antibody. When retesting three weeks later, all remaining residents also tested positive. conclusions: Recently it was reported that in Belgium antibodies are present in 3-4% of the general population. Although, the prevalence in our residents is higher, the number is largely insufficient for herd immunity. In staff members of the regional hospital the prevalence of antibodies was 6%. The higher prevalence in nursing home staff (21%) may be related to the complete absence of good quality protection in the first weeks of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank Buntinx","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Peter Claes","author_inst":"Woonzorgcentrum Bessemerberg, Lanaken, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Marjo Gulikers","author_inst":"Woonzorgcentrum Bessemerberg, Lanaken, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Jan Y Verbakel","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jan De Lepeleire","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Michael Van der Elst","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marc Van Ranst","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology (Rega Institute), Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pieter Vermeersch","author_inst":"Department of cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Zerbit","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20104703","rel_title":"COVID-19 in China: Risk Factors and R0 Revisited","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20104703","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 epidemic had spread rapidly through China and subsequently has proliferated globally leading to a pandemic situation around the globe. Human-to-human transmissions, as well as asymptomatic transmissions of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 3rd, public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 is potentially under control. We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020 (excluding Wuhan from our analysis due to missing data). Understanding the characteristics of spatiotemporal clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. The prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. We performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R0 among different regions for prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic (different age group percentage compared to the total population) factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions will help prioritize segments of a given community\/ region for action and provide a visual aid in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region. Furthermore, revised estimation and our methodology will aid in improving the human health consequences of COVID-19 elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irtesam Mahmud Khan","author_inst":"BUET"},{"author_name":"Wenyi Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Sumaira Zafar","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Wang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Junyu He","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hailon Sun","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ubydul Haque","author_inst":"University of North Texas Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"M.

This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socio-economic factors largely depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement lockdowns. In this phase the further spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified. Methods We analyze the geographical distribution of known cases per capita across 401 local districts in Germany, once for infections in the initial phase and for new infections during the second phase. Results In Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the second phase, richer districts and districts with a higher share of university-educated employees record fewer new infections, whilst the initial safety advantage of more socially deprived districts disappears. Conclusion The social stratification of Covid-19 changes substantively across the two phases of the pandemic in Germany. Only in the second phase does socio-economic advantage turn into a safety advantage. Thus, suggestions that the pandemic predominantly hits the poor needs to be qualified.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Pluemper","author_inst":"Vienna University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Eric Neumayer","author_inst":"London School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Sumaira Zafar","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Wang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Junyu He","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hailon Sun","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ubydul Haque","author_inst":"University of North Texas Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"M.

This is done by using six commonly available metrics that are monitored daily across the state describing the pandemic impact: number of new cases, percent positive tests, deaths, occupied hospital beds, occupied intensive care beds and utilized ventilators, all directly related to confirmed COVID-19 patients. Nebraska is separated into six Health Care Coalitions based on geography, public health and medical care systems. The PRAM aggregates the data for each of these geographic regions based on disease prevalence acceleration and health care resource utilization acceleration, producing real time analysis of the acceleration of change for each metric individually and also combined into a single weighted index, the PRAM Recovery Index. These indices are then shared daily with the state leadership, coalition leaders and public health directors and also tracked over time, aiding in real time regional and statewide decisions of resource allocation and the extent of use of comprehensive non-pharmacologic interventions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey P Gold","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher Wichman","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Bayles","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ali S Khan","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher Kratochvil","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James V Lawler","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Martin Lowe","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shelly Schwedhelm","author_inst":"Nebraska Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brandon Grimm","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20097444","rel_title":"Diagnostic power of chest CT for COVID-19: to screen or not to screen","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20097444","rel_abs":"Background: chest CT is increasingly used for COVID-19 screening in healthcare systems with limited SARS-CoV-2 PCR capacity. Its diagnostic value was supported by studies with methodological concerns and its use is controversial. Here we investigated its potential to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic patients and to screen asymptomatic patients in a prospective study with minimal selection bias. Methods: From March 19, 2020 to April 20, 2020 we performed parallel SARS-CoV-2 PCR and CT with categorization of COVID-19 suspicion by CO-RADS, in 859 patients with COVID-19 symptoms and 1138 controls admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 unrelated medical urgencies. CT-CORADS was categorized on a 5-point scale from 1 (very low suspicion) to 5 (very high suspicion). AUC under ROC curve were calculated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients to predict positive SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and likelihood ratios for each CO-RADS score were used for rational selection of diagnostic thresholds. Findings: CT-CORADS had significant (P<0.0001) diagnostic power in both symptomatic (AUC=0.891) and asymptomatic (AUC=0.700) patients hospitalized during SARS-CoV-2 peak prevalence. In symptomatic patients (41.7% PCR+), CO-RADS [&ge;] 3 detected positive PCR with high sensitivity (89.1%) and 72.5% specificity.

Incidental detection of CO-RADS [&ge;] 3 in asymptomatic patients should trigger reflex testing for respiratory pathogens.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristof De Smet","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Dieter De Smet","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, AZ Delta Medical Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Ingel Demedts","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Pulmonary Diseases"},{"author_name":"Bernard Bouckaert","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Pulmonary Diseases"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ryckaert","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Emanuel Laridon","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Birgit Heremans","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Ruben Vandenbulcke","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Stefaan Gryspeerdt","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Geert Antoine Martens","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105502","rel_title":"Almitrine as a non ventilatory strategy to improve intrapulmonary shunt in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105502","rel_abs":"In severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure, hypoxia is mainly related to pulmonary vasodilation with altered hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Besides prone positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option to improve oxygenation. Patients and Method. A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg\/kg\/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 control COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2. Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78) years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1 (135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used : 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p = 0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over 10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same time, the controls did not change PaO2. In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning. This pharmacological intervention may offer an alternative and\/or an additional effect to proning and might delay or avoid more demanding modalities such as ECMO.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MARIE REINE LOSSER","author_inst":"CHRU NANCY"},{"author_name":"COLINE LAPOIX","author_inst":"CHRU NANCY"},{"author_name":"BENOIT CHAMPIGNEULLE","author_inst":"CHU Grenoble Alpes"},{"author_name":"MATTHIEU DELANNOY","author_inst":"CHRU NANCY"},{"author_name":"JEAN FRANCOIS PAYEN","author_inst":"CHU Grenoble Alpes"},{"author_name":"DIDIER PAYEN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY PARIS 7"},{"author_name":"Birgit Heremans","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Ruben Vandenbulcke","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Stefaan Gryspeerdt","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Geert Antoine Martens","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20106112","rel_title":"Going by the Numbers : Learning and Modeling COVID-19 Disease Dynamics","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20106112","rel_abs":"The COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has resulted in a challenging number of infections and deaths worldwide.

This cut-off yielded a true negative ratio of 89% and accuracy of 70%. The data suggested that amplification of the GUSB gene by RT-PCR may help to appraise the accuracy of negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in patients in whom Covid-19 is eventually diagnosed.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eliseo Albert","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Blanca Ferrer","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Torres","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Alicia Serrano","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Alcaraz","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Javier Buesa","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

Currently, severe and non-severe COVID-19 types are differentiated by only a few clinical features, which do not comprehensively characterize complicated pathological, physiological, and immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 invasion in different types. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe and 148 in severe type, from Wuhan, China. The patients' comorbidity and symptoms (26 features), and blood biochemistry (26 features) upon admission were acquired as two input modalities. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that these features differed substantially between two clinical types. Machine learning random forest (RF) models using features in each modality were developed and validated to classify COVID-19 clinical types. Using comorbidity\/symptom and biochemistry as input independently, RF models achieved >90% and >95% predictive accuracy, respectively. Input features' importance based on Gini impurity were further evaluated and top five features from each modality were identified (age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gender, diabetes; D-Dimer, hsTNI, neutrophil, IL-6, and LDH). Combining top 10 multimodal features, RF model achieved >99% predictive accuracy. These findings shed light on how the human body reacts to SARS-CoV-2 invasion as a unity and provide insights on effectively evaluating COVID-19 patient's severity and developing treatment plans accordingly. We suggest that symptoms and comorbidities can be used as an initial screening tool for triaging, while biochemistry and features combined are applied when accuracy is the priority.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuanfang Chen","author_inst":"Institute of HIV\/AIDS\/STI Prevention and Control, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Liu Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng Bao","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, USA"},{"author_name":"Qian Li","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University, Kunshan 215300, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Han","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Hengdong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Xu","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Yaorong Ge","author_inst":"Department of Software and Information Systems, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Shi Chen","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28262, USA"},{"author_name":"Arantxa valdivia","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clnico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

Though children are at comparatively lower risk compared to adults, the Indian population has a large young demographic that is likely to be at higher risk due to exposure to pollution, malnutrition and poor access to medical care. We aimed to quantify the potential impact of COVID-19 on Indias child population. Methods: We combined district family household survey data with data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China to analyze the potential impact of COVID-19 on children under the age of 5, under three different scenarios; each of which assumed the prevalence of infection to be 0.5%, 1%, or 5%. Results: We find that in the lowest prevalence scenario, across the most populous 18 Indian states, asymptomatic, non-hospitalized symptomatic and hospitalized symptomatic cases could reach 87,200, 412,900 and 31,900, respectively. In a moderate prevalence scenario, these figures reach 174,500, 825,800, and 63,800, and in the worst case, high prevalence scenario these cases could climb as high as 872,200, 4,128,900 and 319,700. Conclusion: These estimates show COVID-19 has the potential to pose a substantial threat to Indias large population of children, particularly those suffering from malnutrition and exposure to indoor air pollution, who may have limited access to health services.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Katie Tseng","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Hauck","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Geetanjali Kappor","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Aditi Sriram","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Arindam Nandi","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ramanan Laxminarayan","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ming Xu","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Yaorong Ge","author_inst":"Department of Software and Information Systems, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Shi Chen","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28262, USA"},{"author_name":"Arantxa valdivia","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clnico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

The whole polyclonal antibody repertoire in a retrospective cohort of 538 individuals was mapped against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, the main target of antibody immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bioinformatic predictions identified 15 major B cell epitopes for S of SARS-CoV-2. Several epitopes localised in RBD of S including those spanning the ACE2-binding site, the highly conserved cryptic epitope of the neutralizing antibody of SARS-CoV, and fusion\/entry domains of HR1 and HR2 of S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, some of these epitopes have cross-reactivity to antigens of common pathogens, potentially affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome. High level of anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity in populations with no history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is of clinical relevance and could underpin better understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology in different populations and provide a blueprint for design of effective vaccines and developing better strategies for antibody testing.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaia Palm","author_inst":"Protobios Life Sceinces"},{"author_name":"Mariliis Jaago","author_inst":"Tallinn University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Annika Rahni","author_inst":"Protobios Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nadezhda Pupina","author_inst":"Protobios Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Arno Pihlak","author_inst":"Protobios Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Helle Sadam","author_inst":"Protobios Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Annela Avarlaid","author_inst":"Tallinn University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Anu Planken","author_inst":"North Estonia Medical Centre Foundation"},{"author_name":"Margus Planken","author_inst":"North Estonia Medical Centre Foundation"},{"author_name":"Liina Haring","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Eero Vasar","author_inst":"Center of Excellence for Genomics and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Miljana Bacevic","author_inst":"Dental Biomaterial Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Liege"},{"author_name":"France Lambert","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Liege"},{"author_name":"Eija Kalso","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Pirkko Pussinen","author_inst":"Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pentti Tienari","author_inst":"Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Antti Vaheri","author_inst":"Department of Virology, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Dan Lindholm","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tonis Timmusk","author_inst":"Tallinn University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Amir M Ghaemmaghami","author_inst":"School of Life Sceinces, University of Nottingham"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105866","rel_title":"Acute cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105866","rel_abs":"Introduction: Cardiac complications of COVID-19 are potentially life-threatening.

We have combined SEIRD model with a time-dependent infection rate function, to fit the real data of i) infection counts and ii) death rates due to COVID-19, for the period between March 2nd and Mai 15th 2020. By fitting the infection rate, SEIRD model placed the infection peak on 04\/24\/2020 and could reproduce it to a large extent on the expense of recovery and death rates. Fitting the SEIRD model to death rates gives rather satisfactory predictions with a maximum of infections on 04\/06\/2020.

We propose a non-parametric model to fit the number of daily deaths in a region, which hypothesizes that the death incidence curve will have a convex shape in the beginning, a concave shape near the peak, and a convex shape in the final stage of the death incidence curve after the peak. Using this, we performed robust short-term predictions on phases in five countries worldwide and five US states.
