This pandemic is the result of a zoonotic coronavirus, Severe Acute Respirsatory Syndrom Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is believed to have originated in bats and transferred to humans possibly through an intermediate host species (Zhou et al. 2020; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2020). The virus attacks host cells by attaching to a cell membrane surface protein receptor called ACE2 (Ge et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2020). Given the critical role of ACE2 as a binding receptor for a number of coronaviruses, we studied the molecular evolution of ACE2 in a diverse range of mammalian species. Using ACE2 as the target protein, we wanted to specifically test the Red Queen hypothesis (Dawkins and Krebs 1979) where the parasite and host engage in an evolutionary arms race which can result in positive selection of their traits associated to their fitness and survival. Our results clearly show a phylogenetically broad evolutionary response, in the form of positive selection detected at the codon-level in ACE2. We see positive selection occurring at deep branches as well as 13 incidents at the species level. We found the strongest level of positive selection in Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), donkey (Equus asinus), large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), and dog (Canis lupus familiaris). At the codon-level, we found up to 10% of ACE2 codons are impacted by positive selection in the mammalian lineages studied. This phylogenetically broad evolutionary arms race can contribute to the emergence of new strains of coronaviruses in different mammalian lineages with a potential to transfer between species given the common binding receptor ACE2. Our study provides a molecular evolutionary perspective to the current pandemic and sheds light on its evolutionary mechanisms.\n\n\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\" (Theodosius Dobzhansky)","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehrdad Hajibabaei","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Gregory AC Singer","author_inst":"Centre for Environmental Genomics Applications, eDNAtec Inc."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20069732","rel_title":"COVID-19 and Environmental factors.

We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the impact of environmental factors on human coronaviruses. Temperature, humidity and other environmental factors have been recorded as environmental drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and in other countries. Higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. In our review, the analysis of 23 studies show evidence that high temperature and high humidity reduce the COVID-19 transmission. However, further studies concerning other environmental (namely meteorological) factors role should be conducted in order to further prove this correlation. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Apostolos Vantarakis","author_inst":"University of Patras"},{"author_name":"Ioanna Chatziprodromidou","author_inst":"University of Patras"},{"author_name":"Thomas Apostolou","author_inst":"Department of Physiotherapy, School of Health Sciences, International Hellenic University,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20076414","rel_title":"The impact of isolation measures due to COVID-19 on energy intake and physical activity levels in Australian university students","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20076414","rel_abs":"Background: The pandemic inflicted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in physical isolation measures in many parts of the world. In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. This disruption to daily life may have consequences for eating and physical activity patterns. Methods: In this observational study, we examined the effect of isolation measures, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March\/April), on diet (24-hour diet recall, ASA-24) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns among third-year biomedical students in Brisbane, Australia. Findings were compared to students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years. Results: In females, energy intake was ~20% greater in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019, and the frequency of snacking and energy density of consumed snacks were also increased. In males, there was no difference in energy intake or snacking behaviour. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes, whereby fewer students undertook any walking activity and, of those that did, time spent doing so was less compared with 2018 and 2019. The proportion of students reporting any vigorous activity was not different for males or females but, among males who participated in this level of activity, the duration was less in 2020 compared with previous years. The proportion of male and female students achieving sufficient levels of activity, defined by at least 150 mins over at least 5 sessions, was ~30% less in 2020. Indeed, the majority of students reported as having undertaken less physical activity than usual. Conclusions: Increased energy intake for females and reduced physical activity for males and females demonstrate impacts of isolation measures that may have deleterious consequences for physical and mental wellbeing, with the potential to affect long-term nutrition and activity patterns.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linda A Gallo","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Tania F Gallo","author_inst":"North Melbourne Football Club"},{"author_name":"Sophia L Young","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Karen M Moritz","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Akison","author_inst":"The Univeristy of Queensland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nutrition"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20082396","rel_title":"Virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19.","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20082396","rel_abs":"Objectives: To describe the implementation and early experience of virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19. Design: observational cohort study. Setting: large Australian metropolitan health service with established virtual health care program and remote patient monitoring capability. Participants: patients with COVID-19 living within the health service who can self-isolate safely, do not require immediate admission to an inpatient setting, have no major active comorbid illness and can be managed at home or other suitable accommodation. Main outcome measures: care escalation rates, including hospital admission. Results: between 11-29 March 2020, 162\/173 (93.6%) locally diagnosed patients with COVID-19 were accepted to the virtual health care program, median age 38y (range 11-79). For the 62 patients discharged during this period the median length of stay was 8 days (range 1-17). The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per Registered Nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 times (range 1-30) during this period, with video consultations used 66.3% of the time; 132\/162 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low: ambulance attendance, 5 (3%); ED attendance, 4 (2.5%); hospital admission, 3 (1.9%). There were no deaths. Conclusions: community-based virtual health care is feasible for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian context for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them including strategies supporting consumer use of health information technologies.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Owen Hutchings","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Cassandra Dearing","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Dianna Jagers","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Miranda Shaw","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Freya Raffan","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jones","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Richard Taggart","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Tim Sinclair","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Teresa Anderson","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Angus G Ritchie","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20088369","rel_title":"Medical overuse in the Iranian healthcare system: a systematic scoping review and practical recommendations for decreasing medical overuse during unexpected COVID-19 pandemic opportunity","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20088369","rel_abs":"Background: Overuse of medical care is a major problem across health systems as well as in Iran. By our knowledge, this is the first scoping review in which medical overuse in the Iranian healthcare system was investigated. Objective: To perform an inclusive search for original studies that report medical overuse in the Iranian healthcare system. Methods: A systematic search of the literature conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane and Scientific Information Database using a comprehensive search strategy without time limit until the end of 2018, accomplished by reference tracking, author contacting and expert consultation to identify studies on the overuse of medical care. Results: We reviewed 4124 published articles based on predetermined inclusion criteria. The authors consensus included a total of 40 articles. Of these, 31 were in English and 9 in Farsi, published between 19975-2018. The result categorized into two distinct clinical areas: treatment (17 articles), and diagnostic (23 articles) services. Almost all of the studies only described the magnitude of unnecessary overuse. Unnecessary overuse of Antibiotics, MRI and CT-scan were the most reported topics. The ranges of their overuse proportion were as follows; Antibiotic (31 to 97%); MRI (33 to 88%), and CT-scan (19 to 50%). Conclusions: Our review showed, even so, the magnitude of unnecessary overuse of medical services is high but there are only a few interventional studies in clinical and administrative level for finding effective methods for decreasing these unnecessary services. Researchers should be encouraged to conducting interventional studies. We suggest the ministry of health to use the golden opportunity of COVID-19 epidemic for designing Iran national policy and action plan for controlling and preventing unnecessary health care services and including a section for Interventional Research in the action plan.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Zakaria Pezeshki","author_inst":"Tabriz university of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Janati","author_inst":"Tabriz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Morteza Arab-Zozani","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miranda Shaw","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Freya Raffan","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jones","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Richard Taggart","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Tim Sinclair","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Teresa Anderson","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Angus G Ritchie","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20092338","rel_title":"Saliva is less sensitive than nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 detection in the community setting","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20092338","rel_abs":"The use of saliva collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in the ambulatory setting provides several advantages when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), including ease of self-collection and reduced use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now, therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of COVID-19. Methods: Firstly we constructed genetically modified food-grade probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, with sequence of seven tandem repeats of mature human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter to produce the cas001. A total of 20 healthy SD rats, half male and half female (There were five male and five female in the control group, the same in treatment group) were used to observe the acute toxic reaction and death after daily administration of cas001 for three weeks, which helps to provide necessary reference basis for clinical dose selection, verificaition of toxic reaction and possible target organs. According to the estimated clinical dosage of 1 x 108CFU \/kg\/day, considering the conversion of body surface area, the dose for rats should be multiplied by 6.17 to 6 x 108 CFU\/kg\/day. We administrated 100 times higher dose at 6 x 1010 CFU\/kg\/day to rats. In order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cas001, male SD rats (body weight 250-300g, 1 x 1010 \/animal, n=3) were given oral administration of LL-37 bacteria powder. The concentration of LL-37 in the blood before and after gavage was detected by ELISA kit (Hycult biotechnology Cat# HK321). Human clinical study was approved by Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (S2020-074-04) and a total of 11 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled in Wuhan hankou hospital and Huoshenshan hospital. They were enrolled voluntarily and all patients signed informed consent. Among them, there were 5 males and 6 females, aged 55 {+\/-} 12 (36-70) years old, and the duration from onset to medication enrollment was 35 {+\/-} 19 (5-68) days. 6 patients were nucleic acid positive and 5 patients were nucleic acid negative when they were enrolled. All patients received the oral drug cas001 treatment according to requirement(1 x 109 CFU\/capsule, 3 capsules\/time, three times a day for 3weeks), with an average follow-up time of 33 {+\/-} 15 days (see table 1 for the results). Findings: Western blot analysis shows that reasonable amount of LL-37 were induced by different concentrations of nisin, which means we have successfully constructed cas001. In the pre-clinical safety evaluation test, after three weeks administration of cas001, no adverse effects were observed on the rat's body weight, food and water intake, hematological or serum biochemical parameters. The results showed that the LD50 of cas001 was higher than that of the 100 times of the expected clinical dose of 6 x 1010 CFU\/day. These results showed that cas001 could be safe in animal experiments. In addition, rat pharmacokinetics results showed that the serum concentration of LL-37 reached peak 2 hours after gavage of cas001 and returned to basal level 6 hours after gavage. During study period, the volunteers did not feel any discomfort while taking the cas001 capsules, and two hours after oral administration, the concentration of LL-37 were increased in healthy volunteers. cas001 shows definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms and may play a role in the improvement of results of nucleic acid test and lung CT test. 11 patients enrolled showed good compliance, tolerance, subjective feeling and actively interacted with the doctors. None of the patients had any adverse reactions. Conclusions Based on above observations, we conclude here that as an oral anti-viral agent, cas001 displayed good safety profiles. It is very hard to reach conclusion of clinical outcomes related to the cas001, although changes of several symptoms indicate encouraging findings.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanlin Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yiming Zhao","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxiao Jiang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuying Zhao","author_inst":"980 Hospital of PLA Joint Logistics Support Forces"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Chen Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Meng Dong","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20087734","rel_title":"Nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa and albuterol administered to mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients: A case series","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20087734","rel_abs":"Background Mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a mortality of 24-53%, in part due to distal mucopurulent secretions interfering with ventilation. Dornase alfa is recombinant human DNase 1 and digests DNA in mucoid sputum. Nebulized dornase alfa is FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19, acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for staff. Here, we report a single center case series where dornase alfa was administered through an in-line nebulizer system to minimize risk of virus aerosolization. Methods Demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were collected from the electronic medical records of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, including three requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO), treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli), between March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including longitudinal values capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed. Results Following nebulized in-line administration of dornase alfa with albuterol, the fraction of inspired oxygen requirements was reduced for all five patients. All patients remain alive and two patients have been discharged from the intensive care unit. No drug associated toxicities were identified. Conclusions The results presented in this case series suggest that dornase alfa will be well-tolerated by critically ill patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials are required to formally test the dosing, safety, and efficacy of dornase alfa in COVID-19, and two have recently been registered (NCT04359654 and NCT04355364). With this case series, we hope to contribute to the development of management approaches for critically ill patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew G.

We determined the burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in persons residing in United States (US) who are at risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Methods Age (60 years or greater), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, and\/or malignancy were used to identify persons at risk for admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death with COVID-19 infection. Persons were classified as low risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (two or more risk factors present) using nationally representative sample of US adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017 and 2018 survey. Results Among a total of 5856 participants, 2386 (40.7%) were considered low risk, 1325 (22.6%) moderate risk, and 2145 persons (36.6%) as high risk for severe COVID-19 infection. The proportion of patients who had pre-existing stroke increased from 0.6% to 10.5% in low risk patients to high risk patients (odds ratio [OR]19.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]11.6-34.3). The proportion of who had pre-existing myocardial infection (MI) increased from 0.4% to 10.4% in low risk patients to high risk patients (OR 30.6, 95% CI 15.7-59.8). Conclusions A large proportion of persons in US who are at risk for developing severe COVID 19 infection are expected to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Further studies need to identify whether targeted strategies towards cardiovascular diseases can reduce the mortality in COVID-19 infected patients.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adnan I Qureshi","author_inst":"Zeenat Qureshi Stroke Institute"},{"author_name":"Alice S Chau","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington and the Center for Immunity and Immunotherapies, Seattle Children'"},{"author_name":"Mikala Egeblad","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Betsy J Barnes","author_inst":"Center for Autoimmune, Musculoskeletal and Hematopoietic Diseases, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Departments of Molecular Medicine and P"},{"author_name":"Tobias Janowitz","author_inst":"Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Northwell Health Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Chen Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Meng Dong","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20086504","rel_title":"Modeling COVID 19 in the Basque Country: from introduction to control measure response","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20086504","rel_abs":"In March 2020, a multidisciplinary task force (so-called Basque Modelling Task Force, BMTF) was created to assist the Basque Health managers and the Basque Government during the COVID-19 responses. BMTF is a modeling team, working on different approaches, including statistical methods and artificial intelligence. In this paper we describe and present the results obtained by a new stochastic SHARUCD model framework which was able to describe the disease incidence data provided by the Basque Health Services. Our models differentiate mild and asymptomatic from severe infections prone to be hospitalized and were able to predict the course of the epidemic, from introduction to control measure response, providing important projections on the national health system necessities during the increased population demand on hospital admissions. Short and longer-term predictions were tested with good results adjusted to the current epidemiological data, showing that the partial lockdown measures were effective and enough to slow down disease transmission in the Basque Country. The growth rate ({lambda}(t)) is calculated from the model and from the data and the implications for the reproduction ratio r are shown. At the moment, the reproduction ratio (r(t)) is estimated to be below the threshold behavior of r=1, but still close to 1, meaning that although the number of new cases are decelerating, a careful monitoring of the development of the outbreak is required. This framework is now being used to monitor disease transmission while the country lockdown is gradually lifted, with insights to specific programs for a general policy of ''social distancing'' and home quarantining. These are the first publicly available modeling results for the Basque Country and the efforts will be continued taking into consideration the updated data and new information that are generated over time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maira Aguiar","author_inst":"1.

Methods: A cross sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 27th of March and 27th of April 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD 7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 9.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Non-Saudi residents, aged 50 years and above, divorced, retired, university students, and those with income (2000 to 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing depression. Saudi individuals, married, unemployed, and those with high income (> 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. Conclusions: There is a wide range of the Saudi residents who are at higher risk of mental illness during COVID 19 pandemic.

Psychological Distress (PD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of pandemics is not well known. The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown. Patients and methods We recruited patients in 4 groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Index (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients characteristics in order to better identify the one who were the most at-risk. Results The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 years (SD=13,71), 7.96% (141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 years (SD=8,14). In total, 38.06% (674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI [&ge;]15). An ANOVA analysis showed that sex (p=0.00132), unemployment (p=7.16x10-6) and depression (p=7.49x10-7) were significantly associated with a higher PDI score. Patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588). Conclusion Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high. These patients are also at increased risk to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Specific steps should be implemented to monitor and prevent PD through dedicated mental health policies if we want to limit the public health impact of COVID-19 in time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Chaix","author_inst":"Hospital Gui de Chauliac, Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Delamon","author_inst":"Wefight, Brain & Spine Institute, Paris"},{"author_name":"Arthur Guillemasse","author_inst":"Wefight, Brain & Spine Institute, Paris"},{"author_name":"Benoit Brouard","author_inst":"Wefight, Brain & Spine Institute, Paris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Emmanuel Bibault","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris"},{"author_name":"Ayat T Al-Meanazel","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Al Albayt University, Al Mafraq, Jordan."},{"author_name":"Osaid T Al Meanazel","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20096388","rel_title":"Behaviors and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from a cross-national Facebook survey","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20096388","rel_abs":"In the absence of medical treatment and vaccination, the mitigation and containment of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic relies on behavioral changes. Timely data on attitudes and behaviors are thus necessary to develop optimal intervention strategies and to assess the consequences of the pandemic for different demographic groups. We developed a rapid response monitoring system via a continuously run online survey (the \"COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey\") across eight countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States). The survey was specifically designed to collect key information on people's health status, behaviors, close social contacts, and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an innovative approach to recruit participants via targeted Facebook advertisement campaigns in order to generate balanced samples for post-stratification. In this paper, we present results for the period from March 13-April 19, 2020. We estimate important differences by sex: women show a substantially higher perception of threat along with a lower level of confidence in the health system. This is paralleled by sex-specific behaviors, with women more likely to adopt a wide range of preventive behaviors. We thus expect behavior to serve as a protective factor for women. Our findings also show a higher level of awareness and concern among older respondents, in line with the evidence that the elderly are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19. While across all the samples respondents were less concerned for themselves than for their country or for the world, we also observed substantial temporal and spatial heterogeneity in terms of confidence in institutions and responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Perrotta","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9 Grow","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Francesco Rampazzo","author_inst":"Centre for Population Change, University of Southampton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jorge Cimentada","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Del Fava","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sofia Gil-Clavel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Emilio Zagheni","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20095844","rel_title":"Anxiety, depression, attitudes, and internet addiction during the initial phase of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Mexico.","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20095844","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives: To describe the prevalence and distribution of anxiety and depression among Mexican population, and to examine its association with internet addiction during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design: A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting: General population in Mexico. Participants: 561 subjects were recruited (71% female, mean age of was 30.7 {+\/-} 10.6 years). Interventions: An online survey to assess personal attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19, sleep-disorders related, the Mexican version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) was applied. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Prevalence of anxiety, depression, internet addiction and sleep disorders and associated factors. Also, prevalence for anxiety and depression were compared to an historic control group. Results: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence for anxiety and depression was 50% (95% CI, 45.6% to 54.1%) and 27.6%, (95% CI 23.8% to 31.4%), respectively. We found a 51% (33% to 50%) increase in anxiety and up to 86% increase in depression uring the initial weeks of the lock-down compared to the control group. According to the IAT questionnaire, 62.7% (95% CI 58.6% to 68.8%) of our population had some degree of internet addiction. Odds ratio for development of anxiety symptoms was 2.02 (95% CI1.56-2.1, p=0.0001) and for depression was 2.15 (95% CI 1.59-2.9, p=0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, younger age (p=0.006), sleep problems (p=0.000), and internet addiction ( p=0.000) were associated with anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Our study provides valuable information on the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Mexican population.

Methods: The clinical data of COVID-19 in the elderly patients admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center during the period of January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were collected. A retrospective cohort study design was conducted to screen out independent factors through Cox univariable regression analysis and multivariable regression analysis, and the efficacy of risk prediction of severe or critical illness was examined through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: A total of 110 elderly patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. 52 (47.3%) were males and 21 (19.1%) had severe or critical illness. Multivariable regression analysis showed that CD4 cells and D-dimer were independent risk factors. D-dimer, CD4 cells, and D-dimer\/CD cells ratios with cut off values of 0.65 (mg\/L), 268 (cell\/ul) and 431 were in the prediction of severe or critical illness of the elderly COVID-19. The AUC value of D-dimer, CD4 cells, CD4 cells\/D-dimer ratio, the tandem group and the parallel group were 0.703, 0.804, 0.794, 0.812 and 0.694, respectively.

However, several critical hurdles have impeded the development of robust AI model, which include deficiency, isolation, and heterogeneity of CT data generated from diverse institutions. These bring about lack of generalization of AI model and therefore prevent it from applications in clinical practices. To overcome this, we proposed a federated learning-based Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI, http:\/\/www.ai-ct-covid.team\/), a decentralized architecture where the AI model is distributed to and executed at each host institution with the data sources or client ends for training and inferencing without sharing individual patient data. Specifically, we firstly developed an initial AI CT model based on data collected from three Tongji hospitals in Wuhan. After model evaluation, we found that the initial model can identify COVID from Tongji CT test data at near radiologist-level (97.5% sensitivity) but performed worse when it was tested on COVID cases from Wuhan Union Hospital (72% sensitivity), indicating a lack of model generalization. Next, we used the publicly available UCADI framework to build a federated model which integrated COVID CT cases from the Tongji hospitals and Wuhan Union hospital (WU) without transferring the WU data. The federated model not only performed similarly on Tongji test data but improved the detection sensitivity (98%) on WU test cases. The UCADI framework will allow participants worldwide to use and contribute to the model, to deliver a real-world, globally built and validated clinic CT-COVID AI tool. This effort directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals' number 3, Good Health and Well-Being, and allows sharing and transferring of knowledge to fight this devastating disease around the world.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongchao Xu","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liya Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Information Management, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Ke Ma","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jiehua Yang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Yang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yaobing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Shu","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Ziwei Fan","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jiefeng Gan","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyu Zou","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Renhao Huang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Changzheng Zhang","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Liu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Methods 231 nurse practitioners were enrolled who worked in isolation region in designated hospitals to admit patients with COVID-19 in China. Demographic data, goggle-associated symptoms and underlying reasons, incidence of medical errors or exposures, the effects of fog in goggles on practice were all collected. Data were stratified and analyzed by age or working experience. Risk factors of goggle-associated medical errors were analyzed by multivariable logistical regression analysis. Findings Goggle-associated symptoms and foggy goggles widely presented in nurses. The most common symptoms were headache, skin pressure injury and dizziness. Headache, vomit and nausea were significantly fewer reported in nurses with longer working experience while rash occurred higher in this group. The underlying reasons included tightness of goggles, unsuitable design and uncomfortable materials. The working status of nurses with more working experience was less impacted by goggles. 11.3% nurses occurred medical exposures in clinical practice while 19.5% nurses made medical errors on patients. The risk factors for medical errors were time interval before adapting to goggle-associated discomforts, adjusting goggles and headache. Interpretation Goggle-associated symptoms and fog can highly impact the working status and contribute to medical errors during management of COVID-19. Increased the experience with working in PPE through adequate training and psychological education may benefit for relieving some symptoms and improving working status. Improvement of goggle design during productive process was strongly suggested to reduce incidence of discomforts and medical errors.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao-huan He","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Yan-ru Feng","author_inst":"Xi Kang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gao-ming Li","author_inst":"Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jiao Pang","author_inst":"Air Force Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ting Chen","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ya-li Zhou","author_inst":"San Ai Tang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Armed Police Force Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Jing Lang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Li-min Li","author_inst":"Characteristic Medical Center of the Chinese people's Armed Police Force"},{"author_name":"Li Feng","author_inst":"Special Service Sanatorium Center of the Chinese people's Armed Police Force"},{"author_name":"Xin He","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Hongming Miao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Yong-hua Wang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Given that Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) are known to be activated during and participate in inflammatory processes, we examined whether HERV dysregulation signatures are present in COVID-19 patients. Results: By comparing transcriptomes of Peripheral Blood Monocytes (PBMCs) and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) from patients and normal controls we have shown that HERVs are intensely dysregulated in BALF, but not in PBMCs. In particular, upregulation in the expression of multiple HERV families was detected in BALF samples of COVID-19 patients, with HERV-W being the most highly upregulated family among the families analysed. In addition, we compared the expression of HERVs in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBECs) without and after senescence induction in an oncogene-induced senescence model, in order to quantitatively measure changes in the expression of HERVs in bronchial cells during the processes of cellular senescence. Conclusions: This apparent difference of HERV dysregulation between PBMCs and BALF warrants further studies in involvement of HERVs in inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms as well as exploration of HERVs as potential biomarkers for disease progression. Furthermore, the increase in the expression of HERVs in senescent HBECs in comparison to non-induced HBECs provides a potential link for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality in aged populations.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Konstantina Kitsou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Kotanidou","author_inst":"1st Department of Critical Care & Pulmonary Services, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Paraskevis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Timokratis Karamitros","author_inst":"Unit of Bioinformatics and Applied Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Aris Katzourakis","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Richard Tedder","author_inst":"Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tara Hurst","author_inst":"Birmingham City University, Birmingham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Spyros Sapounas","author_inst":"National Public Health Organization, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Athanassios Kotsinas","author_inst":"Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Gorgoulis","author_inst":"Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vana Spoulou","author_inst":"Immunobiology and Vaccine Research Laboratory, First Department of Peadiatrics, Aghia Sophia Childrens Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian U"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, MedicalSchool, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Pagona Lagiou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gkikas Magiorkinis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Although official data show that the number of newly infected is declining, it is still unknown what proportion of the population has been affected by the disease. AIM To examine seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in industry workers population sample. METHODS From 23 to 28 April 2020, we conducted serological testing for antibodies (IgG and IgM) on 1494 factory employees living in the Split-Dalmatia and Sibenik-Knin County (Croatia). We analysed antibody seroprevalence on the level of the company, county, and separately for employees living at the factory premises with limited mobility during the lockdown measures. RESULTS In a total sample of tested company employees, we detected antibodies in 1.27% of participants (95% CI 0.77-1.98%). In Split facility 13\/1316 (0.99%, 95% CI 0.53-1.68%) of participants were tested positive, of which 13\/1079 (1.20%, 95% CI 0.64-2.05%) of those living outside the facility and 0\/237 (0%, 95% CI 0-1.26%) of those living inside the facility. In Knin facility, 6\/178 (3.37%, 95% CI 1.25-7.19%) participants were tested positive for antibodies. The difference between Split (no mobility restrictions) and Knin, was not statistically significant ({chi}2 = 3.47, P = 0.062). CONCLUSIONS The study showed relatively small SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in the DIV Group population sample. When the study findings are interpreted on the county levels, they could indicate that most of the counties' population was not exposed to the virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan Jerkovic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences University of Split"},{"author_name":"Toni Ljubic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences University of Split"},{"author_name":"Zeljana Basic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ivana Kruzic","author_inst":"University Deparment ofForensic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nenad Kunac","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Josko Bezic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Arijana Vuko","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Dr. Fran Mihaljevic University Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia; Catholic University of Croatia, Zagreb, Croatia; University of Rijeka School o"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split, Split, Croatia; University of Split, School of Medicine, Sp"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Gorgoulis","author_inst":"Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vana Spoulou","author_inst":"Immunobiology and Vaccine Research Laboratory, First Department of Peadiatrics, Aghia Sophia Childrens Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian U"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, MedicalSchool, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Pagona Lagiou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gkikas Magiorkinis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe PMC (which covers pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv). We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies. Results: We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-PCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 4% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17% (95% CI: 14% - 20%) overall; higher in aged care 20% (14% - 27%), and lower in non-aged care 16% (13% - 20%). Five studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases. Overall, there was a 42% lower relative risk of asymptomatic transmission compared to symptomatic transmission (combined Relative Risk: 0.58; 95% CI 0.335-0.994, p=0.047). Discussion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oyungerel Byambasuren","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Magnolia Cardona","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Katy Bell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mary-Louise McLaws","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Arijana Vuko","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Dr. Fran Mihaljevic University Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia; Catholic University of Croatia, Zagreb, Croatia; University of Rijeka School o"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split, Split, Croatia; University of Split, School of Medicine, Sp"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Gorgoulis","author_inst":"Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vana Spoulou","author_inst":"Immunobiology and Vaccine Research Laboratory, First Department of Peadiatrics, Aghia Sophia Childrens Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian U"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, MedicalSchool, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Pagona Lagiou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gkikas Magiorkinis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

This is achieved via a SEIR model. Using an expected latent period of 4.5 days and infectious period of 3.8 days, R_0 was first estimated as 3.18 using observed death rates under unmitigated spread and then under the effects of the total lockdown (R_0=0.60) of 23 March. The case fatality rate given infection is taken as 1%. Parameter values for mean length of stay and conditional probability of death for ICU and non-ICU hospital admissions are guided by Ferguson et al.(2020). Under unmitigated spread the model predicts around 600,000 deaths in the UK. Starting with one exposed person at time zero and a suppression consistent with an R_0 of 0.60 on day 72, the model predicts around 39,000 deaths for a first wave, but this reduces to around 11,000 if the intervention takes place one week earlier. If the initial suppression were in place until day 200 and then relaxed to an R_0 of 1.5 between days 200 and 300, to be followed by a return to an R_0 of 0.60, the model predicts around 43,000 deaths. This would increase to around 64,000 if the release from the first suppression takes place 20 days earlier. The results indicate the extreme sensitivity to timing and the consequences of even small delays to suppression and premature relaxation of such measures.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John S Dagpunar","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Magnolia Cardona","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Katy Bell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mary-Louise McLaws","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Arijana Vuko","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Dr. Fran Mihaljevic University Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia; Catholic University of Croatia, Zagreb, Croatia; University of Rijeka School o"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split, Split, Croatia; University of Split, School of Medicine, Sp"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Gorgoulis","author_inst":"Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vana Spoulou","author_inst":"Immunobiology and Vaccine Research Laboratory, First Department of Peadiatrics, Aghia Sophia Childrens Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian U"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, MedicalSchool, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Pagona Lagiou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gkikas Magiorkinis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Objective: Herein, we evaluated the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiography in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic. Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity. Air-bronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%). Additionally, the lung lesions were dominant on the right side in all patients. Conclusions: In conclusion, considering our results that the lung is affected in asymptomatic patients, it will be necessary to extend the indications of COVID-19 testing for effective management of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Cheol Chang","author_inst":"Yeungnam University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Hur","author_inst":"Yeungnam University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Donghwi Park","author_inst":"Ulsan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mary-Louise McLaws","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Arijana Vuko","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Dr. Fran Mihaljevic University Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia; Catholic University of Croatia, Zagreb, Croatia; University of Rijeka School o"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split, Split, Croatia; University of Split, School of Medicine, Sp"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Gorgoulis","author_inst":"Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vana Spoulou","author_inst":"Immunobiology and Vaccine Research Laboratory, First Department of Peadiatrics, Aghia Sophia Childrens Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian U"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, MedicalSchool, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Pagona Lagiou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gkikas Magiorkinis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 380 published\/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We supply relevant metadata such as evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody\/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature.

Methods: Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. Results: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CI): 4.89 - 8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CI 3.05 - 5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection. Conclusion: This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Although for extreme cases, the quarantine period should be extended up to three weeks.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Long Viet Bui","author_inst":"Center for Research - Consulting and Support of Community Health"},{"author_name":"Ha Thu Nguyen","author_inst":"108 Millitary Central Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hagai Levine","author_inst":"Hebrew University-Hadassah"},{"author_name":"Ha Nguyen","author_inst":"People's Police Academy, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thu Anh Nguyen","author_inst":"Woolcock Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Thuy Phuong Nguyen","author_inst":"Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia"},{"author_name":"Truong Nguyen","author_inst":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Toan Thi Thanh Do","author_inst":"Hanoi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ngoc Pham Tuan","author_inst":"198 Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hanh My Bui","author_inst":"Hanoi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Vana Spoulou","author_inst":"Immunobiology and Vaccine Research Laboratory, First Department of Peadiatrics, Aghia Sophia Childrens Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian U"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, MedicalSchool, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Pagona Lagiou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gkikas Magiorkinis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Methods: 90 individuals were enrolled in this study, 30 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Using two comprehensive 11-color flow cytometric panels conforming to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and approved for clinical diagnostics, we longitudinally examined cell count differences in lymphocyte populations and T cell activation in COVID-19 patients. Findings: Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were differentially decreased in COVID-19 patients according to clinical severity. In severe disease (SD) patients, all lymphocyte subsets were reduced, whilst in mild disease (MD) NK, NKT and {gamma}{delta} T cells were at the level of HC. Additionally, we provide evidence of T cell activation in MD but not SD, when compared to HC. Interestingly, follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients. Interpretation: Our data suggest that activation and expansion of innate and adaptive lymphocytes play a major role in COVID-19. Additionally, recovery is associated with formation of T cell memory as suggested by the missing formation of effector and central memory T cells in SD but not in MD. Our data imply that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells contributes to convalescence in MD. Thus, understanding the T cell-response in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan Odak","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joana Barros-Martins","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Berislav Bosnjak","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Klaus Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sascha David","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Olaf Wiesner","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Busch","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marius M Hoeper","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Isabell Pink","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Welte","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Cornberg","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM), Hannover, G"},{"author_name":"Matthias Stoll","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lilia Goudeva","author_inst":"Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Transplant Engineering, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rainer Blasczyk","author_inst":"Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Transplant Engineering, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Arnold Ganser","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Immo Prinz","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM), Hannover, Germany; Cluster of Excellence RESIST "},{"author_name":"Reinhold Foerster","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM), Hannover, Germany; Cluster of Excellence RESIST "},{"author_name":"Christian Koenecke","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (Ci"},{"author_name":"Christian R Schultze-Florey","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

A better understanding of patient clinical profiles is essential to drive efficient and timely health service strategies. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for a higher susceptibility to symptomatic presentation with COVID-19 and a transition to severe disease. Methods: We analysed data on 2756 patients admitted to Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1st January and 23rd April 2020. We compared differences in characteristics between patients designated positive for COVID-19 and patients designated negative on hospitalisation and derived a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19, we used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with progression to severe disease defined by: 1) admission to the hospital AICU, 2) the need for mechanical ventilation, 3) in-hospital mortality, and 4) at least one measurement of elevated D-dimer (equal or superior to 1,000 ug\/L) indicative of increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Results: The patient population consisted of 1148 COVID-19 positive and 1608 COVID-19 negative patients. Age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, respiratory rate, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure formed the most parsimonious model for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19 at hospital admission. Among 1148 patients with COVID-19, 116 (10.1%) were admitted to the AICU, 71 (6.2%) required mechanical ventilation, 368 (32.1%) had at least one record of D-dimer levels [&ge;]1,000 g\/L, and 118 patients died. In the multivariable logistic regression, age (OR = 0.953 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.937-0.968) C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007), and white blood cell counts (OR = 1.059 per 109\/L, 95% CI: 1.010-1.111) were found to be associated with admission to the AICU. Age (OR = 0.973 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.955-0.990), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.003 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006) and sodium (OR = 0.915 per 1 mmol\/L, 0.868-0.962) were associated with mechanical ventilation. Age (OR = 1.023 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.004-1.043), CRP (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006), and body temperature (OR = 0.723 per 1oC, 95% CI: 0.541-0.958) were associated with elevated D-dimer. For mortality, we observed associations with age (OR = 1.060 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.040-1.082), female sex (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.442, 95% CI: 0.245-0.777), Asian ethnic background (OR = 2.237 vs White ethnic background, 95% CI: 1.111-4.510), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), sodium (OR = 1.038 per 1 mmol\/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), and respiratory rate (OR = 1.054 per 1 breath\/min, 95% CI: 1.024-1.087). Conclusion: Our analysis suggests there are several demographic, clinical and laboratory findings associated with a symptomatic presentation of COVID-19. Moreover, significant associations between patient deterioration were found with age, sex and specific blood markers, chiefly C-reactive protein, and could help early identification of patients at risk of poorer prognosis. Further work is required to clarify the extent to which our observations are relevant beyond current settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert A Fletcher","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Thomas Matcham","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Marta Tib\u00farcio","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Arseni Anisimovich","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Stojan Jovanovi\u0107","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Luca Albergante","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Nadezda Lipunova","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Anne Hancock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.

This clinical figure is significantly different from that of anosmia after upper respiratory infection, which occurs in only a small proportion of patients and does not recover or requires months to recover. The background mechanisms of COVID-19 induced olfactory dysfunction have not been elucidated.Methods To address the unique pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19, we examined the existence and distribution of ACE2 (virus binding receptor), TMPRSS2 and Furin (proteases to facilitate virus entry) in the nasal mucosa, composed of the respiratory mucosa (RM) and olfactory mucosa (OM), and the olfactory bulb (OB) in mouse and human tissues by immunohistochemistry and gene analyses.Results Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin gene expressions were confirmed in the nasal mucosa and OB. ACE2 was widely expressed all in the RM, OM and OB. Co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin was observed in the RM including the RE and subepithelial glands and in the OM, especially in the supporting cells on the olfactory epithelium and the Bowman\u2019s glands. Notably, the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the OM were positive for ACE2 but almost negative for TMPRSS2 and Furin. The cells in the OB expressed ACE2 strongly and Furin weakly and did not express TMPRSS2.Conclusions ACE2 was widely expressed in the RM, OM and OB, but TMPRSS2 and Furin were expressed in certain types of cells and were absent in the ORNs. These findings, together with clinically reported ones, suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural and central dysfunction and, to some extent, conductive olfactory dysfunction. That the ORNs express ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 or Furin may explain the early recovery of anosmia.Short Summary Protein expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS, and Furin suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural dysfunction without olfactory neuronal damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rumi Ueha","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Kenji Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Ryoji Kagoya","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shigeyuki Shichino","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Regulation of Inflammatory and Immune Diseases, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Ueha","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Regulation of Inflammatory and Immune Diseases, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Yamasoba","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Nadezda Lipunova","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Anne Hancock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.

This study aims to investigate factors associated with COVID-19 positivity for the first 669 UK Biobank participants; compared with individuals who tested negative, and with the untested, presumed negative, rest of the population. Methods: We studied 1,474 participants from the UK Biobank who had been tested for COVID-19. Given UK testing policy, this implies a hospital setting, suggesting at least moderate to severe symptoms. We considered the following exposures: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ACEi\/ARB use, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and smoking. We undertook comparisons between: 1) COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 tested negative participants; and 2) COVID-19 tested positive and the remaining participants (tested negative plus untested, n=501,837). Logistic regression models were used to investigate univariate and mutually adjusted associations. Results: Among participants tested for COVID-19, non-white ethnicity, male sex, and greater BMI were independently associated with COVID-19 positive result. Non-white ethnicity, male sex, greater BMI, diabetes, hypertension, prior MI, and smoking were independently associated with COVID-19 positivity compared to the remining cohort (test negatives plus untested). However, similar associations were observed when comparing those who tested negative for COVID-19 with the untested cohort; suggesting that these factors associate with general hospitalisation rather than specifically with COVID-19. Conclusions: Among participants tested for COVID-19 with presumed moderate to severe symptoms in a hospital setting, non-white ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI are associated with a positive result. Other cardiometabolic morbidities confer increased risk of hospitalisation, without specificity for COVID-19. Notably, ACE\/ARB use did not associate with COVID-19 status.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Raisi-Estabragh","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Celeste McCracken","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Maddalena Ardissino","author_inst":"Sir Alexander Fleming Building, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mae S Bethell","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Huntingdon, UK"},{"author_name":"Jackie Cooper","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cyrus Cooper","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C Harvey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steffen E Petersen","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.
