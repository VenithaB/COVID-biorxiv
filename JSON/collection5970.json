Materials and method We monitored health care workers (HCW) of our Cancer Institute with the rapid serological test Viva-DiagTM analyzing COVID-19 associated-IgG\/IgM. Test were performed at time 0 and after 14 days; Rt-PCR and CLIA assays were also perfoRmed in positive Viva-DiagTM cases. 606 and 393 HCW had blood sample taken at time 0 and 14, respectively. Results Overall, 9 HCW (1.5%) resulted not-negative at Viva-DiagTM and one of them was confirmed positive for SARS-COV2 infection at RT-PCR oropharingeal swab. At time 0, all 9 cases showed some IgM expression and only one IgG; after 14 days IgM persisted in all cases while IgG became evident in 4 ones. A parallel CLIA test was performed in 23 quaratined subjetcs and in all Viva-Diag not negative cases. CLIA confirmed a positive level of IgM in 5\/13 positive Viva-Diag cases; conversely, IgG was confirmed positive at CLIA in 4\/5 cases positive at Viva-Diag. These results pose the question of different performances of the two tests. Conclusions Our study suggest that Viva-Diag assay can be of help in individualizing SARS_COV2 infected people fisrt of all in cohorts of subjetcs with high prevalence. Different performances of serological colorimetric and CLIA tools remain to be ascertained.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angelo Virgilio Paradiso","author_inst":"Istituto tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"simona De Summa","author_inst":"IRCCS-Istituto Tumori \"Giovanni Paolo II\""},{"author_name":"Nicola Silvestris","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Stefania Tommasi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Antonio Tufaro","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Angela Maria Vittoria Larocca","author_inst":"Policlinico of Bari"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Michele Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20085779","rel_title":"Shared Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell Responses Against the SARS-COV-2 Spike Protein in HLA A*02:01 COVID-19 Participants","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20085779","rel_abs":"We report here on antigens from the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, that when presented by Class I MHC, can lead to cytotoxic CD8+ T cell anti-viral responses in COVID-19 patients.

That library is used to detect the evolution of virus-specific T cell populations from two COVID-19 patients, at two time points over the course of infection. Both patients exhibit similar virus-specific T cell populations, but very different time-trajectories of those populations.

These tests differ between one another in several ways. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, and assessed their real-world performance under scenarios of varying proportion of infected individuals. We included independent studies that specified the antigen used for antibody detection and used quantitative methods. We identified nine independent studies, of which six were based on commercial ELISA or CMIA\/CLIA assays, and three on in-house tests. Test sensitivity ranged from 68% to 93% for IgM, from 65% to 100% for IgG, and from 83% to 98% for total antibodies. Random-effects models yielded a summary sensitivity of 82% (95%CI 75-88%) for IgM, and 85% for both IgG (95%CI 73-93%) and total antibodies (95%CI 74-94%). Specificity was very high for most tests, and its pooled estimate was 98% (95%CI 92-100%) for IgM and 99% (95%CI 98-100%) for both IgG and total antibodies. The heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity across tests was generally high (I2[&le;]50%). In populations with a low prevalence ([&le;]5%) of seroconverted individuals, the positive predictive value would be [&le;]88% for most assays, except those reporting perfect specificity.

Herein, we report the dynamics of antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and virus neutralization activity in 44 COVID-19 patients. RBD-specific IgG responses were detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. Using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibody titers were also detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. The magnitude of RBD-specific IgG binding titers correlated strongly with viral neutralization. In a clinical setting, the initial analysis of the dynamics of RBD-specific IgG titers was corroborated in a larger cohort of PCR-confirmed patients (n=231). These findings have important implications for our understanding of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the use of immune plasma as a therapy, and the development of much-needed vaccines.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehul S Suthar","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zimmerman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Robert Kauffman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Grace Mantus","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Susanne Linderman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Abigail Vanderheiden","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Lindsay Nyhoff","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Carl Davis","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Seyi Adekunle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Affer","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Melanie Sherman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stacian Reynolds","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Hans Verkerke","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David N Alter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jeannette Guarner","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Janetta Bryksin","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Horwath","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Connie Arthur","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Natia Saakadze","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Hughes Smith","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Srilatha Edupuganti","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Erin M Scherer","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kieffer Hellmeister","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Cheng","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Juliet A Morales","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Neish","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sean R Stowell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Filipp Frank","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eric Ortlund","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Evan Anderson","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Vineet Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Nadine Rouphael","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Aneesh Metha","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David S Stephens","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rafi Ahmed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"John Roback","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jens Wrammert","author_inst":"Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20084657","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 detection in setting of viral swab scarcity: are MRSA swabs and viral swabs equivalent?","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20084657","rel_abs":"Abstract: Background: The global pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has resulted in unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems. One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Methods: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. Results: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs 480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). Conclusion: We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs 480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured using COPAN ESwabs 480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daneil G Federman","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Shaili Gupta","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Gary Stack","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Sheldon M Campbell","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"David R Peaper","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Louise M Dembry","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Ann Fisher","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Asim F Tarabar","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Michael Kozal","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Ruser","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Melanie Sherman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stacian Reynolds","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Hans Verkerke","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David N Alter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jeannette Guarner","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Janetta Bryksin","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Horwath","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Connie Arthur","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Natia Saakadze","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Hughes Smith","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Srilatha Edupuganti","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Erin M Scherer","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kieffer Hellmeister","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Cheng","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Juliet A Morales","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Neish","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sean R Stowell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Filipp Frank","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eric Ortlund","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Evan Anderson","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Vineet Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Nadine Rouphael","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Aneesh Metha","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David S Stephens","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rafi Ahmed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"John Roback","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jens Wrammert","author_inst":"Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20055947","rel_title":"A 5-min RNA preparation method for COVID-19 detection with RT-qPCR","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20055947","rel_abs":"RNA extraction has become a bottleneck for detection of COVID-19, in part because of reagent shortages.

Here we evaluate clinical and imaging parameters for estimating the need of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Methods: We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data from 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on PCR positivity. IL-6, CRP, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined in blood samples. Two radiologists evaluated the severity of imaging findings in computed tomography (CT) images on a scale from 1 (no characteristic signs of COVID-19) to 5 (confluent ground glass opacities in over 50% of the lung parenchyma). The volume of affected lung was quantified using commercially available software. Machine learning modelling was performed to estimate the risk for intensive care unit treatment. Findings: Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased IL-6, CRP and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts. The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients. Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean +\/- standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 +\/- 0.1, 0.86 +\/- 0.16 and 0.80 +\/- 0.1 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79 +\/- 0.1.

Controlling for location-specific fixed effects and local policies, we found a negative relationship between the estimated reproduction number and temperatures above 25oC, a U-shaped relationship with outdoor ultraviolet exposure, and weaker positive associations with air pressure, wind speed, precipitation, diurnal temperature, SO2, and ozone. We projected the relative risk of COVID-19 transmission due to environmental factors in 1,072 global cities. Our projections suggest warmer temperature and moderate outdoor ultraviolet exposure may offer a modest reduction in transmission; however, upcoming changes in weather alone will not be enough to fully contain the transmission of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ran Xu","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Hazhir Rahmandad","author_inst":"MIT Sloan School of Management"},{"author_name":"Marichi Gupta","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Catherine DiGennaro","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Navid Ghaffarzadegan","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Heresh Amini","author_inst":"Section of Environmental Health, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen; Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to infection and severe disease. Health and housing authorities in England have developed a residential intervention that aims to isolate those vulnerable to severe disease (COVID-PROTECT) and care for people with symptoms (COVID CARE). Methods: We used a discrete-time Markov chain model to forecast COVID-19 infections among people experiencing homelessness, given strong containment measures in the general population and some transmission among 35,817 people living in 1,065 hostels, and 11,748 people sleeping rough (the 'do nothing' scenario). We then estimated demand for beds if those eligible are offered COVID-PROTECT and COVID-CARE. We estimated the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospital admissions that could be achieved by these interventions. We also conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses to identify programme success factors. Results: In a 'do nothing' scenario, we estimate that 34% of the homeless population could get COVID-19 between March and August 2020, with 364 deaths, 4,074 hospital admissions and 572 critical care admissions. In our 'base intervention' scenario, demand for COVID-PROTECT peaks at 9,934 beds, and demand for COVID-CARE peaks at 1,366 beds. The intervention could reduce transmission by removing symptomatic individuals from the community, and preventing vulnerable individuals from being infected. This could lead to a reduction of 164 deaths, 2,624 hospital admissions, and 248 critical care admissions over this period. Sensitivity analyses showed that the number of deaths is sensitive to transmission of COVID-19 in COVID-PROTECT. If COVID-PROTECT capacity is limited, scenario analyses show the benefit of prioritising people who are vulnerable to severe disease. Conclusion: Supportive accommodation can mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the homeless population of England, and reduce the burden on acute hospitals.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Lewer","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Isobel Braithwaite","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Miriam Bullock","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Max T Eyre","author_inst":"Lancaster University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Robert W Aldridge","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Heresh Amini","author_inst":"Section of Environmental Health, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen; Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

During the initial epidemic in England, virus testing for older adults was restricted to symptomatic hospitalized patients. We aimed to estimate associations between pre-existing diagnoses and COVID-19 status, in a large community cohort. Methods: UK Biobank (England) participants assessed 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with COVID-19 status (16th March to 14th April 2020) in logistic models, adjusted for demographics, study site and other diagnoses. Results: There were 274,356 participants aged 65+, including 448 (0.16%) hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Common co-morbidities in patients were hypertension (58.5%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.1%), history of fall or fragility fractures (30.6%), and type 2 diabetes (19.6%). However, in adjusted models, COVID-19 patients were more likely than other participants to have pre-existing dementia (OR=3.07 95% CI 1.71 to 5.50), COPD (OR= 1.82 CI 1.33 to 2.49), depression (OR=1.81 CI 1.36 to 2.40), type 2 diabetes (OR=1.70 CI 1.30 to 2.21), chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation. Hypertension was modestly associated (OR=1.29 CI 1.04 to 1.59), but CHD (OR=0.92 CI 0.71 to 1.20) prevalence was similar in COVID-19 patients and other participants. Conclusion: Specific co-morbidities are disproportionally common in older adults who develop severe COVID-19. Tailored interventions may be needed, as these results do not support simple age-based targeting to prevent severe COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janice L Atkins","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Jane AH Masoli","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Joao Delgado","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Luke C Pilling","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Chia-Ling C Kuo","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"George Kuchel","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Michael Dommasch","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gerhard Schneider","author_inst":"Clinic for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fabian Geisler","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Huber","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

We aimed to study the association between ethnicity and risk of COVID-19 and adjust it by deprivation and previous comorbidity. Methods: Prospective cohort. UK Biobank participants from England linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and COVID-19 tests until 14 April 2020. COVID-19 infection was based on a positive PCR test. Ethnicity was self-reported and classified using Office of National Statistics groups. Socioeconomic status was based on index of multiple deprivation quintiles. Comorbidities were extracted from HES. We used Poisson regression to estimate rate ratios of infection according to ethnicity, adjusted for socioeconomic status, alcohol drinking, smoking, BMI, age, sex, and comorbidity. Results: 415,582 participants were included, with 2,886 tested and 1,039 positive for COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was 0.85% (0.67% - 1.09%) in Black\/Black British participants, 0.47% (0.30%-0.74%) in other ethnicities, 0.58% (0.44%-0.76%) in Asian\/Asian British, 0.30% (0.11%-0.80%) in Chinese, 0.23% (0.11%-0.52%) in mixed, and 0.23% (0.21%-0.34%) in White. Compared with White participants, Black\/Black British participants had an adjusted relative risk (RR) of 2.66 (2.03-3.88), Asian\/Asian British participants 2.09 (1.53-2.84), Chinese participants 1.72 (0.64-4.61), other ethnicities 1.67 (1.04-2.68), and mixed ethnicities 0.93 (0.41-2.07). Socioeconomic status (adjusted RR 1.73 (1.43-2.1) for the most deprived), was also associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19 rates in England are higher in BAME communities, and in those living in deprived areas. Public health strategies are needed to reduce COVID-19 infections among the most susceptible groups.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Roger Paredes","author_inst":"IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute"},{"author_name":"DANIEL PRIETO-ALHAMBRA","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luke C Pilling","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Chia-Ling C Kuo","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"George Kuchel","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Michael Dommasch","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gerhard Schneider","author_inst":"Clinic for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fabian Geisler","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Huber","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

To determine trends in transition of this epidemic in India we performed a study in states at various levels of human development index (HDI). Methods: We used publicly available data sources to track progress of covid-19 epidemic in India in different states and territories where it was reported in significant numbers. The states (n=20) were classified into tertiles of HDI and weekly trends in cases and deaths plotted from 15 March to 2 May 2020. To assess association of HDI with state-level covid-19 burden we performed Pearson correlation. Logarithmic trends were evaluated for calculation of projections. A microlevel study was performed in select urban agglomerations for identification of socioeconomic status (SES) differentials. Results: There is wide regional variation in covid-19 cases and deaths in India from mid-March to early-May 2020. High absolute numbers have been reported from states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamilnadu. Growth rate in cases and deaths is slow in high HDI states while it has increased rapidly in middle and lower HDI states. In mid-March 2020 there was a strong positive correlation of state-level HDI with weekly covid-19 cases (r= 0.37, 0.40) as well as deaths (r= 0.31, 0.42). This declined by early-May for cases (r= 0.04, 0.06) as well as deaths (r= -0.005, 0.001) with significant negative logarithmic trend (cases R squared= 0.92; deaths R squared= 0.84). These trends indicate increasing cases and deaths in low HDI states. Projection reveals that this trend is likely to continue to early-June 2020. Microlevel evaluation shows that urban agglomerations are major focus of the disease in India and it has transited from middle SES to low SES locations. Conclusion: There is wide variability in burden of covid-19 in India. Slow growth and flattening of curve is observed in high-HDI states while disease is increasing in mid and lower HDI states. Projections reveal that lower HDI states would achieve parity with high HDI states by early-June 2020. Covid-19 is mostly present in urban agglomerations where it has transited from upper-middle to low SES locations. Public health strategies focusing on urban low SES locations and low HDI states are crucial to decrease covid-19 burden in India.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajeev Gupta","author_inst":"Eternal Heart Care Centre & Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Rajinder K Dhamija","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College and SSK Hospital, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kiran Gaur","author_inst":"SKN Agricultural College, SKN Agricultural University, Jobner, Jaipur, India"},{"author_name":"Luke C Pilling","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Chia-Ling C Kuo","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"George Kuchel","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Michael Dommasch","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gerhard Schneider","author_inst":"Clinic for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fabian Geisler","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Huber","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

We implemented a \"care map\", as a standardized multidisciplinary approach to improve patients monitoring using: uniform patient selection for ICU admission, a low-PEEP strategy and a pharmacologic strategic thromboembolism management. Methods A standardized protocol for managing COVID-19 patients and ICU admissions was implemented through accurate Early Warning Score (EWS) monitoring and thromboembolism prophylaxis at hospital admission. Dyspnea, mental confusion or SpO2 less than 85% were criteria for ICU admission. Ventilation approach employed low PEEP values (about 10 cmH2O in presence of lung compliance > 40 mL\/cmH2O) and FiO2 as needed. In presence of lower lung compliance (< 40 mL\/cmH2O) PEEP value was increased to about 14 cmH2O. Results From March 16th to April 12nd 2020, 41 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our ICU from a total of 310 patients. 83% (34) of them needed mechanical ventilation. The ventilation approach chosen employed low PEEP value based on BMI (PEEP 11+\/- 3.8 (10-12) cmH2O if BMI < 30 Kg\/m2; PEEP 15+\/- 3.26 (12-18) cmH2O if BMI >30 Kg\/m2). To date, ten patients (24%) died, four (9.7%) received mechanical ventilation, two were transferred to another hospital and 25 (60.9%) were discharged from ICU after a median of nine days. Discussion A multimodal approach for COVID-19 patients is mandatory. The knowledge of this multi-organ disease is growing rapidly, requiring improvements in the standard of care. Our approach implements an accurate pre-ICU monitoring and strict selection for ICU admission, and allows to reduce mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and mortality. Funding No funding has been required.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuele Ceruti","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Marco Roncador","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich"},{"author_name":"Olivier Gie","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Bona","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Martina Iattoni","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Maira Biggiogero","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Pier Andrea Maida","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Management Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Christian Garzoni","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Romano Mauri","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Huber","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

With the aim to explore more about its aspects, we adopted the SEIQRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered-Death) pandemic spread with a time delay on the heterogeneous population and geography in this work. Focusing on the spatial heterogeneity, the entire population of interest in a region is divided into small distinct geographical sub regions, which interact by means of migration networks across boundaries. Utilizing the estimations of the time delay differential equations based model, we analyzed the spread dynamics of disease in a region and its sub regions. The model based numerical outcomes are validated from real time available data for India. We computed the approximate peak infection in forward time and relative timespan when disease outspread halts. To further evaluate the influence of the delay on the long term system dynamics, the sensitivity analysis is performed on time delay. The most crucial parameter, basic reproduction number R0 and its time-dependent generalization, has been estimated at both regional and sub regional levels. The impact of the most significant lockdown measure that has been implemented in India to contain the pandemic spread has been extensively studied by considering no lockdown scenario. A suggestion based on outcomes, for a bit relaxed lockdown, followed by an extended period of strict social distancing as one of the most effective control measures to manage COVID-19 spread is provided for India.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arvind Kumar Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Natasha Sharma","author_inst":"Kanya Maha Vidyalaya, Jalandhar"},{"author_name":"Atul Kumar Verma","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Bona","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Martina Iattoni","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Maira Biggiogero","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Pier Andrea Maida","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Management Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Christian Garzoni","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Romano Mauri","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Huber","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

These tools have been used by millions of consumers around the world, and many health organisations promote them as a way of encouraging lifestyle change. However, heart age tools vary widely in terms of their underlying risk models and display formats, the effectiveness of these tools compared to other CVD risk communication formats remains unclear, and doctors have raised concerns over their use to expand testing of healthy low risk adults. Methods and analysis: We aim to systematically review both qualitative and quantitative evidence of the effects of heart age when presented to patients or consumers for the purpose of CVD risk communication. Four electronic databases will be search until April 2020 and reference lists from similar review articles will be searched. Studies will be considered eligible if they meet the following criteria: (1) published from the inception of the database to April 2020, in peer-reviewed journals, (2) used an adult population (over 18 years of age) or, if not explicit regarding age, are clear that participants were not children, (3) present the concept of heart age to patients or consumers for the purpose of CVD risk communication, (4) report qualitative themes or quantitative outcomes relating to psychological and\/or behavioural responses to heart age. Two reviewers will perform study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Reporting of the review will be informed by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidance. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval is not required as it is a protocol for a systematic review. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carissa Bonner","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carys Batcup","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Michael Fajardo","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jenny Doust","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Kevin McGeechan","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Lyndal Trevena","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Management Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Christian Garzoni","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Romano Mauri","author_inst":"Clinica Luganese Moncucco"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Huber","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Protzer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of ACEi or ARB in patients admitted with COVID-19 was conducted. PubMed and Embase were searched and six studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated that 18.3% of the patients admitted with COVID-19 were prescribed ACEi\/ARBs (0.183, CI 0.129 to 0.238, p<0.001). The use of RAAS inhibitors did not show any association with critical events (Pooled OR 0.833 CI 0.605 to 1.148, p=0.264) or death (Pooled OR 0.650, CI 0.356 to 1.187, p=0.161).

An initial step in estimating the impact of these changes is characterizing the patients, visits, and diagnoses for whom care is being delayed or deferred. Methods: We conducted an observational study, examining demographics and diagnoses for all patient visits to the ED of an urban Level-1 trauma center before and after the state declaration and compared them to visits from a similar period in 2019. We estimated the ratios of the before and after periods using Poisson regression, calculated the percent change with respect to 2019 for total ED visits, patient characteristics, and diagnoses, and then evaluated the interactions between each factor and the overall change in ED visits. Results: There was a significant 35.2% drop in overall ED visits after the state declaration. Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, abdominal and back pain. Significantly disproportionate increases were seen in ED visits for potential symptoms of COVID-19, including URIs, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Conclusions: Patient concerns about health care settings and public health have significantly altered care-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall and differential declines in ED visits for certain demographic groups and disease processes should prompt efforts to encourage care-seeking and research to monitor for the morbidity and mortality that is likely to result from delayed or deferred care.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bjorn C Westgard","author_inst":"Regions Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew W Morgan","author_inst":"Regions Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Vazquez-Benitez","author_inst":"HealthPartners Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren O Erickson","author_inst":"HealthPartners Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael D.

We investigate the effect of non-electronic interventions (voluntary isolation upon symptom onset, quarantining private contacts) and of electronic interventions (contact tracing thanks to the app), depending on the willingness to quarantine, parameterized by four cooperating probabilities. For a given `effective' R_0 obtained with non-electronic interventions, we use non-negative matrix theory and stopping line techniques to characterize mathematically the minimal fraction y_0 of app users needed to curb the epidemic. We show that under a wide range of scenarios, the threshold y_0 as a function of R_0 rises steeply from 0 at R_0=1 to prohibitively large values (of the order of 60-70\\% up) whenever R_0 is above 1.3.

Numerous observational studies have suggested that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte proportion and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are inflammatory markers. Our study aimed to detect the role of NLR, PLR in predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: Four hundred and fifteen consecutive patients were enrolled in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center affiliated to Fudan University, between 20 January and 11 April 2020 with confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiology, symptoms, signs, and laboratory examinations during the hospital stay were collected and compared between non-severe and severe patients. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 25.0 software. Results: Four hundred and fifteen laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in our study, among which 386 (93%) patients were not severe, and 27 (7%) were severe. The proportion of males in severe cases is higher than in non-severe cases (75.86% vs. 50.52%, P=0.008). The age between the two groups is different (p=0.022). Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients exhibited more comorbidities, including hypertension (48.28% vs. 19.43%, p<0.001), diabetes (20.69% vs. 6.99%, p=0.009), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (51.72% vs. 6.22%, p<0.001), and fatty liver (37.93% vs. 15.8%, p=0.002), respectively. NLR and PLR showed significant difference (p<0.001). Diabetes (OR 0.28; 95% CI 15.824-187.186), fatty liver (OR 21.469; 95% CI 2.306-199.872), coronary heart disease (OR 18.157; 95% CI 2.085-158.083), NLR (OR 1.729; 95% CI 1.050-2.847) were significantly associated with severe cases with COVID-19. The NLR of patients in severe group had a 1.729-fold higher than that of no-severe group (OR 1.729; 95% CI 1.050-2.847, P=0.031). Conclusions: NLR is an independent risk factor of severe COVID-19 patients. PLR, NLR were significantly different between severe and non-severe patients, so assessment of NLR, PLR may help identify high risk cases with COVID-19.

Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such samples of the population, which may be affected by collider bias. We illustrate these issues using data from the UK Biobank in which individuals tested for COVID-19 are highly selected for a wide range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the sampling mechanisms that leave aetiological studies of COVID-19 infection and progression particularly susceptible to collider bias. We also describe several tools and strategies that could help mitigate the effects of collider bias in extant studies of COVID-19 and make available a web app for performing sensitivity analyses. While bias due to non-random sampling should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gareth Griffith","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Tim T Morris","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Matt Tudball","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Annie Herbert","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Giulia Mancano","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Pike","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Gemma C Sharp","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Tom M Palmer","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"George Davey Smith","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Kate Tilling","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Luisa Zuccolo","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Gibran Hemani","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Markus Schwaiger","author_inst":"Dean, School of Medicine Technical University of Munich, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marcus R.

The S&S strategy has an antecedent in the \"cocooning\" of infants by immunisation of close family members (Forsyth et al., 2015), and forms a pillar of infection, prevention and control (IPC) strategies (RCN, 2017). We are unaware of it being proposed as a major public health initiative previously. We illustrate the S&S strategy using a mathematical model that segments the vulnerable population and their closest contacts, the \"shielders\". We explore the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of 12 weeks after lockdown. The most important determinants of outcome are: i) post-lockdown transmission rates within the general population segment and between the general and vulnerable segments; ii) the fraction of the population in the vulnerable and shielder segments; iii) adherence with need to be protected; and iv) the extent to which population immunity builds up in all segments. We explored the effects of extending the duration of lockdown and faster or slower transition to post-lockdown conditions and, most importantly, the trade-off between increased protection of the vulnerable segment and fewer restrictions on the general population. We illustrate how the potential for the relaxation of restrictions interacts with specific policy objectives. We show that the range of options for relaxation in the general population can be increased by maintaining restrictions on the shielder segment and by intensive routine screening of shielders. We find that the outcome of any future policy is strongly influenced by the contact matrix between segments and the relationships between physical distancing measures and transmission rates. These relationships are difficult to quantify so close monitoring of the epidemic would be essential during and after the exit from lockdown. More generally, S&S has potential applications for any infectious disease for which there are defined proportions of the population who cannot be treated or who are at risk of severe outcomes.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bram A.D. van Bunnik","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh,Edinburgh, UK; School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex L.K.

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimate the time- varying R0 nationally and in twelve cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within hospital dynamics. We use individual-level data of >1,000 hospitalized patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalizations and deaths. We estimate the national R0 was 3.15 (95% CI: 2.13-3.76) at the start of the epidemic. Starting from around March 6, we find a strong reduction in R0 with an 85% median decrease (95% quantile range, QR: 83%-90%) to a value of 0.44 (95% QR: 0.27-0.65) in the period of March 29-April 5. At the cantonal-level R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 71% and 94%. We found that reductions in R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We found that most of the reduction of transmission is due to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 3% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of R0 well below one are promising. However most of inferred transmission reduction was due to behaviour change (<3% due to natural immunity buildup), with an estimated 97% (95% QR: 96.6%-97.2%) of the Swiss population still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as of April 24. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Chadi Lemaitre","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Javier Perez-Saez","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rinaldo","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Jacques Fellay","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Samuel Haynes","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Jordan Ashworth","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Shengyuan Zhao","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola Rose Cave","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Meghan R.

A major problem for health authorities is that we do not know. In an imaginary world, we might develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19, but is traceable via a cheap and reliable diagnosis. By introducing such an imaginary virus into the population and observing how it spreads, we would have a way of learning about COVID-19 because the benign virus would respond to population behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner. Such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we propose a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative. Our solution is to mimic the benign virus by passing virtual tokens between electronic devices when they move into close proximity. As Bluetooth transmission is the most likely method used for such inter-device communication, and as our suggested \"virtual viruses\" do not harm individuals' software or intrude on privacy, we call these Safe Blues. In contrast to many app-based methods that inform individuals or governments about actual COVID-19 patients or hazards, Safe Blues does not provide information about individuals' locations or contacts. Hence the privacy concerns associated with Safe Blues are much lower than other methods. However, from the point of view of data collection, Safe Blues has two major advantages: - Data about the spread of Safe Blues is uploaded to a central server in real time, which can give authorities a more up-to-date picture in comparison to actual COVID-19 data, which is only available retrospectively. - Sampling of Safe Blues data is not biased by being applied only to people who have shown symptoms or who have come into contact with known positive cases. These features mean that there would be real statistical value in introducing Safe Blues. In the medium term and end game of COVID-19, information from Safe Blues could aid health authorities to make informed decisions with respect to social distancing and other measures. In this paper we outline the general principles of Safe Blues and we illustrate how Safe Blues data together with neural networks may be used to infer characteristics of the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in real time.

We estimated greater excess mortality than official COVID-19 mortality in the U.S. (excess mortality 95% confidence interval (CI) (100013, 127501) vs. 78834 COVID-19 deaths) and 9 states: California (excess mortality 95% CI (3338, 6344) vs. 2849 COVID-19 deaths); Connecticut (excess mortality 95% CI (3095, 3952) vs. 2932 COVID-19 deaths); Illinois (95% CI (4646, 6111) vs. 3525 COVID-19 deaths); Louisiana (excess mortality 95% CI (2341, 3183) vs. 2267 COVID-19 deaths); Massachusetts (95% CI (5562, 7201) vs. 5050 COVID-19 deaths); New Jersey (95% CI (13170, 16058) vs. 10465 COVID-19 deaths); New York (95% CI (32538, 39960) vs. 26584 COVID-19 deaths); and Pennsylvania (95% CI (5125, 6560) vs. 3793 COVID-19 deaths). Conventional model results were consistent with semiparametric results but less precise. Significant excess pneumonia deaths were also found for all locations and we estimated hundreds of excess influenza deaths in New York. We find that official COVID-19 mortality substantially understates actual mortality, excess deaths cannot be explained entirely by official COVID-19 death counts. Mortality reporting lags appeared to worsen during the pandemic, when timeliness in surveillance systems was most crucial for improving pandemic response.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Rivera","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez"},{"author_name":"Janet Rosenbaum","author_inst":"SUNY downstate"},{"author_name":"Walter Quispe","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez"},{"author_name":"Sarat Moka","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Yoni Nazarathy","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rackauckas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Peter G.

The cumulative total number of infected persons as a function of elapsed time has been fitted with power law to find the scaling exponent ({gamma}). The reduction in {gamma} in different countries signals the reduction in the growth of infection, possibly, due to long-term Government intervention. The extent of infection and reproduction rate R_0 of the same are also examined using Farr's law and IDEA model. The new cases per day with time assume Gaussian bell shaped curve, obeying the rule that faster rise follows faster decay. In India and Singapore, the peak of the bell shaped curve is still elusive. It is found that, till date, countries such as Denmark and India implementing sooner lockdown have underwent lower number of new cases of infection. Daily variation shows, R_0 of all the countries is reducing, ushering in fresh hopes to combat COVID-19. Finally, we try to make a prediction as to the date on which the different countries will come down to daily cases of infection as low as one hundred (100).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SRIJIT BHATTACHARYA","author_inst":"BARASAT GOVERNMENT COLLEGE"},{"author_name":"Md Moinul Islam","author_inst":"Department of Physics, APC College, New Barrakpur, Kolkata-700131, W.B, India."},{"author_name":"Alokkumar De","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Raniganj Girls College, Raniganj-713358, W.B., India"},{"author_name":"Sarat Moka","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Yoni Nazarathy","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rackauckas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Peter G.

Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions (both at national and local levels) the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in some cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, epidemic dynamics can be characterized by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations after exponential rises at the outset of disease dynamics. We also show that incorporating long-term awareness can avoid peak resurgence and accelerate epidemic decline. We suggest that awareness of epidemic severity is likely to play a critical role in disease dynamics, beyond that imposed by intervention-driven policies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sang Woo Park","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Ceyhun Eksin","author_inst":"Texas A&M"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Dushoff","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Yoni Nazarathy","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rackauckas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Peter G.

Nevertheless, resolving the importance of environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge, requires accurate measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds, and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, non-linear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting such models with environmental transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 transmission highlights that variation in environmental transmission is an underappreciated aspect of the ecology of infectious disease, and an incomplete understanding of its role has consequences for public health interventions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"C.

Results: In urban counties (n=114), only population density was significantly associated with COVID19 mortality (b = 0.21, p <0.001). In non-urban counties (n=2,629), all hypothesized social determinants were significantly associated with higher levels of mortality. Percentage of uninsured individuals was associated with lower reported COVID-19 mortality (b = -0.36, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Individuals who do not speak English, individuals engaged in farm work, and individuals living in poverty may be at heightened risk for COVID-19 mortality in non-urban counties. Mortality among the uninsured may be being systematically undercounted in county and national level surveillance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca K Fielding-Miller","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Maria E Sundaram","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Brouwer","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Lourdes M.

As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low incidence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low incidence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low incidence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victor M.
