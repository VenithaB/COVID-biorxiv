As hospitalizations for COVID-19-related illness continue to increase, many recent reports indicate the supply of PPE is persistently and significantly less than the demand. These PPE shortages encouraged communities of 3D printing experts and hobbyists to design and distribute homemade, 3D-printed PPE, including N95 mask substitutes. The mask presented, the Kansas City Mask (KC Mask), is one such product which was created from the maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This report discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the KC Mask design and its usage in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods: The KC Mask was adapted from a similar design called the Montana Mask. Mask components were 3D printed and assembled then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, MO as a proof of concept. Results: The QLFT was successful and the KC Mask was approved for use by pandemic response administration staff at the hospital. Fortunately, the KC Mask has not required wide utilization, however, because supply chains for Kansas City area hospitals have, at the time of this publication, not yet been exhausted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The results of Truman Medical Center approval of the KC Mask are promising for this N95 stop-gap substitute. Although further analysis and study is needed for this design, persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitate an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for the KC Mask as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse the KC Mask as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage based on CDC guidelines.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiv Dalla","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brandon Bacon","author_inst":"University of Missouri - Kansas City, Truman Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jack M Ayres","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Holmstead","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Alan J Ahlberg Elliot","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.22.20179994","rel_title":"Teamwork in the manufacturing workplace may hinder social distance","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.22.20179994","rel_abs":"The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections show no signs of stopping.

In previous research, analysis of the factors that influence social distance has also been carried out using information from the US occupation information site O*NET. However, they targeted all industries, not specific industries. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the factors that influence Physical Proximity in the manufacturing industry, which has a large impact on the economy given the scale of employment. As the method, first, exploratory factor analysis is performed using O*NET information, and the extracted 7 variables, Sitting Work, Adverse Conditions, Information Processing, Bridging Work, Teamwork, Response to Aggression, and Intelligent Work, are used in the regression analysis. As a result, it was shown that Teamwork is the biggest factor that influences Physical Proximity. Also, Adverse Conditions and Response to Aggression showed a positive correlation and Sitting Work showed a negative correlation. By job type, Maintenance, Installation & Repair tended to have higher Physical Proximity than Manufacturing Production Process Development, Production & Quality Assurance.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keisuke Kokubun","author_inst":"Economic Research Institute, Japan Society for the Promotion of Machine Industry"},{"author_name":"Brandon Bacon","author_inst":"University of Missouri - Kansas City, Truman Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jack M Ayres","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Holmstead","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Alan J Ahlberg Elliot","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.23.20180299","rel_title":"The health sector cost of different policy responses to COVID-19 in low- and middle- income countries","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.23.20180299","rel_abs":"Much attention has focussed in recent months on the impact that COVID-19 has on health sector capacity, including critical care bed capacity and resources such as personal protective equipment.

Here we present estimates of the total costs of COVID-19 response in low- and middle-income countries for different scenarios of COVID-19 mitigation over a one year period. We find costs vary substantially by setting, but in some settings even mitigation scenarios place a substantial fiscal impact on the health system. We conclude that the choices facing many low- and middle- income countries, without further rapid emergency financial support, are stark, between fully funding an effective COVID-19 reponse or other core essential health services.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Torres Rueda","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sedona Sweeney","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fiammetta Bozzani","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Vassall","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alan J Ahlberg Elliot","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.23.20180497","rel_title":"Bayesian Estimation of the Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.23.20180497","rel_abs":"Accurately estimating the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of appropriate methods.

Pearson correlation tests were conducted between each change to examine the impact of efficiency ranks in the previous stage on subsequent stages. An indicator was developed to judge epidemic stability and was applied to practical cases involving lifting travel restrictions and restarting the economy in some countries. The results showed that Korea and Australia performed with the highest efficiency in preventing the diffusion of COVID-19 for the whole period covering 120 days since the first confirmed case, while the USA ranked at the bottom.

We propose a deterministic linear model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. The linearity assumption makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John E.

Aim and Methods: We estimated the impact of the current treatments on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 by a meta-analysis. The comprehensive search included studies reporting clinical features and treatment strategies published from January 21, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Results: We included 52 studies that involved 13,966 COVID-19 patients. We found that the most prevalent treatments were antivirals (proportion: 0.74, 95% CI : [0.65, 0.83]) and antibiotics (proportion: 0.73, 95% CI: [0.62, 0.83]). The COVID-19 severity increased among patients taking glucocorticoids (risk ratio (RR) = 1.71, 95% CI: [1.06, 2.76]) or immunoglobulins (RR = 3.83, 95% CI: [1.27, 11.53]), and renal replacement therapy (RRT) and glucocorticoids increased the length of ICU stay (RRT : RR= 11.89, 95% CI: [3.26, 43.39]; glucocorticoids: RR = 3.10, 95% CI: [1.52, 6.29]). The COVID-19 severity and mortality increased among patients taking tocilizumab (severity: F = 25.53, P = 0.02; mortality: F = 19.37, P = 0.02). The most effective treatment was the combination of arbidol with lopinavir\/ritonavir compared with placebo (mean difference = 0.5, 95% CI [-0.60, 1.66]), and the safest combination was remdesivir and lopinavir\/ritonavir (RR= 0.78, 95% CI [0.32, 1.91]).

This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Study Participants and Methods We investigated the effect of a three-week 200 mg dose of thiamine in lowering the Th17 response in sixteen DC (proinflammatory origin due to heavy alcohol drinking) patients; and eight healthy control\/volunteers (HV) as a pilot clinical-translational investigation. To further investigate, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the effectiveness of thiamine treatment in lowering the Th17 proinflammatory response in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) treated with ethanol. In this in vitro study, 100 mg\/day equivalent (0.01 ug\/ml) thiamine was used. Based on recent publications, we compared the results of the IL-17 response from our clinical and in vitro study to those found in other proinflammatory disease conditions (metabolic conditions, septic shock, viral infections and COVID-19), including symptoms, and dose ranges of effective and safe administration of thiamine. We developed a dose range and pharmacokinetic profile for thiamine as a novel intervention strategy in COVID-19 to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms. Results The DC group showed significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines compared to HV. Three-week of 200 mg daily thiamine treatment significantly lowered the baseline IL-17 levels while increased IL-22 levels (anti-inflammatory response). This was validated by an in vitro macrophage response using a lower thiamine dose equivalent (100 mg), which resulted in attenuation of IL-17 and elevation of IL-22 at the mRNA level compared to the ethanol-only treated group. In humans, a range of 79-474 mg daily of thiamine was estimated to be effective and safe as an intervention for the COVID-19 cytokine storm. A literature review showed that several neurological symptoms of COVID-19 (which exist in 45.5% of the severe cases) occur in other viral infections and neuroinflammatory states that may also respond to thiamine treatment. Discussion The Th17 mediated IL-17 proinflammatory response can potentially be attenuated by thiamine. Thiamine, a very safe drug even at very high doses, could be repurposed for treating the cytokine\/immune storm of COVID-19 and the subsequent neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. Further studies using thiamine as an interventional\/prevention strategy in severe COVID-19 patients could identify its precise anti-inflammatory role.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vatsalya Vatsalya","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Fengyuan Li","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Jane C Frimodig","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Khushboo S Gala","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Shweta Srivastava","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Maiying Kong","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Vijay A Ramchandani","author_inst":"National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism"},{"author_name":"Wenke Feng","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Craig J McClain","author_inst":"University of Louisville"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20176792","rel_title":"Temporal increase in D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East and North Africa: Phylogenetic and mutation analysis study","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20176792","rel_abs":"Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among molecular sequences.

Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software. Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S gene mutations included: D614G=435, Q677H=8, and V6F=5. A significant increase in the proportion of D614G was noticed from (63.0%) in February 2020, to (98.5%) in June 2020 (p<0.001). Two large phylogenetic clusters were identified via ML analysis, which showed an evidence of inter-country mixing of sequences, which dated back to February 8, 2020 and March 15, 2020 (median estimates). The mean evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 6.5 x 10-3 substitutions\/site\/year based on large clusters' Bayesian analyses.

The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Methods: A prospective controlled trial was performed on 75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. Results: VWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p=0.24). The ADAMTS13\/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4{+\/-}20.5 vs. 79.7{+\/-}33.2, p<0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13\/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA p=0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p=0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical to TTP. The ADAMTS13\/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings render further support to perform studies on the use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 and to include VWF and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian A.

To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","rel_num_authors":53,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Katherine J Siddle","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Bennett M.

We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. Methods: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. Results: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations. QTc prolongation events occurred in 2% of patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine with no reported arrhythmia events among those with data available. Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine exposure was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization. Additional exploration of hydroxychloroquine in this mildly symptomatic outpatient population is warranted.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Ip","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jaeil Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Yizhao Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Andre H Goy","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Hansen","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Andrew L Pecora","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brittany A Sinclaire","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Urszula Bednarz","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Marafelias","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shivam Mathura","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Ihor S Sawczuk","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph P Underwood III","author_inst":"Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David M Walker","author_inst":"Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Prasad","author_inst":"Bayshore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert L Sweeney","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

The aim of our study is to evaluate diagnostic performances of NS compared to NPA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. We collected 300 paired samples (NS and NPA) from children hospitalized and followed up in our paediatric unit. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of NS referred to NPA of the whole sample and then, considering both the age ([&ge;] and < 6 years old) and the period of collection (March vs follow up) as covariates in different analysis. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to NPA; whereas its specificity results high. In children under 6 years of age, our results suggest to prefer the collection of NS, whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of NS becomes higher if it is performed before NPA.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giada Maria Di Pietro","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Ester Capecchi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Ester Luconi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Lunghi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Samantha Bosis","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Bertolozzi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Cantoni","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Paola Marchisio","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Victor Leung","author_inst":"Division of Medical Microbiology and Virology, St. Paul's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Prasad","author_inst":"Bayshore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert L Sweeney","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

We constructed a SARS-CoV-2-induced protein (SIP) network, based on disease signatures defined by COVID-19 multi-omic datasets(Bojkova et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020), and cross-examined these pathways against approved drugs. This analysis identified 200 drugs predicted to target SARS-CoV-2-induced pathways, 40 of which are already in COVID-19 clinical trials(Clinicaltrials.gov, 2020) testifying to the validity of the approach. Using artificial neural network analysis we classified these 200 drugs into 9 distinct pathways, within two overarching mechanisms of action (MoAs): viral replication (130) and immune response (70). A subset of drugs implicated in viral replication were tested in cellular assays and two (proguanil and sulfasalazine) were shown to inhibit replication. This unbiased and validated analysis opens new avenues for the rapid repurposing of approved drugs into clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Namshik Han","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Woochang Hwang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kostas Tzelepis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Patrick Schmerer","author_inst":"Justus-Liebig University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Yankova","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Meabh MacMahon","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Winnie Lei","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Katritsis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anika Liu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alison Schuldt","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Harris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Chapman","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Frank McCaughan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Friedemann Weber","author_inst":"Justus-Liebig University"},{"author_name":"Tony Kouzarides","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Therefore, it is prudent to design therapeutics based on the critical binding region of ACE2, which is a [~]30 aa long helix with a kink in the middle. However, the small peptide in solution may lose its helical conformation and subsequently lose its binding potential to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which it utilizes to bind to that helical region. Here we report the design of four stapled peptides based on that helix, which is expected to bind to SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity and prevent the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the infection. All stapled peptides showed high helical contents (50-94% helicity). On the contrary, the linear control peptide NYBSP-C showed no helicity (19%). We have evaluated the peptides in a pseudovirus based single-cycle assay in HT1080 and human lung cells, A549. Three of the four stapled peptides showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080 (IC50: 1.9 - 4.1 {micro}M) and A549 cells (IC50: 2.2 - 2.8 {micro}M). It is noteworthy that the stapled peptide, NYBSP-3, which showed the least helical content, also had the lowest antiviral activity in both cell lines. The linear peptides NYBSP-C and SBP1, reported recently to bind SARS-CoV-2 with KD of [~]47nM affinity, showed no antiviral activity. Most significantly, none of the stapled peptides show any appreciable cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested. We determined the proteolytic stability of one of the most active stapled peptides, NYBSP-4, in human plasma, which showed a half-life (T1\/2) of >289 min.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Curreli","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Sofia M B Victor","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaohe Tong","author_inst":"CPC Scientific, Inc."},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Asim K Debnath","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Meabh MacMahon","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Winnie Lei","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Katritsis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anika Liu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alison Schuldt","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Harris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Chapman","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Frank McCaughan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Friedemann Weber","author_inst":"Justus-Liebig University"},{"author_name":"Tony Kouzarides","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Effective and widespread vaccination is still uncertain, so many scientific efforts have been directed towards discovering antiviral treatments. Many drugs are being investigated to inhibit the coronavirus main protease, 3CLpro, from cleaving its viral polyprotein, but few publications have addressed this proteases interactions with the host proteome or their probable contribution to virulence. Too few host protein cleavages have been experimentally verified to fully understand 3CLpros global effects on relevant cellular pathways and tissues. Here, we set out to determine this proteases targets and corresponding potential drug targets. Using a neural network trained on coronavirus proteomes with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.983, we predict that a large proportion of the human proteome is vulnerable to 3CLpro, with 4,460 out of approximately 20,000 human proteins containing at least one predicted cleavage site. These cleavages are nonrandomly distributed and are enriched in the epithelium along the respiratory tract, brain, testis, plasma, and immune tissues and depleted in olfactory and gustatory receptors despite the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 patients. Affected cellular pathways include cytoskeleton\/motor\/cell adhesion proteins, nuclear condensation and other epigenetics, host transcription and RNAi, coagulation, pattern recognition receptors, growth factor, lipoproteins, redox, ubiquitination, and apoptosis. This whole proteome cleavage prediction demonstrates the importance of 3CLpro in expected and nontrivial pathways affecting virulence, lead us to propose more than a dozen potential therapeutic targets against coronaviruses, and should therefore be applied to all viral proteases and experimentally verified.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Prescott","author_inst":"N\/A"},{"author_name":"Kerstin Wernike","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Donata Hoffmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas C.

In India, more than 3 million confirmed cases have been reported although with relatively low death rate of 1.8%. In this study, we sequenced 47 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients of 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), the largest state of India using third-generation sequencing technique. The phylogenetic clustering revealed that no UP sample was aligned with the previously defined USA clade, where the mortality was high. We identified 56 distinct SNP variations in the genomes of UP resulting in a unique mutation rate of 1.19% per sequence, which is greater than the value 0.88% obtained for the rest of India. The relatively less death rate in UP indicates that the mutation in the virus is deleterious. Further investigation is required with larger sample size to determine the degree of virulence vis-a-vis SNP variation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priti Prasad","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"Kishan Sahu","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"Babita Singh","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"SK Barik","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow-226001, India"},{"author_name":"Mehar Hasan Asif","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Samir V Sawant","author_inst":"National Botanical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sumit K Bag","author_inst":"CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Katritsis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anika Liu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alison Schuldt","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Harris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Chapman","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Frank McCaughan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Friedemann Weber","author_inst":"Justus-Liebig University"},{"author_name":"Tony Kouzarides","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

One unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the insertion of multi-basic residues at the S1\/S2 subunit cleavage site, the function of which remains uncertain. We found that the virus with intact spike (Sfull) preferentially enters cells via fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas a clone (Sdel) with deletion disrupting the multi-basic S1\/S2 site instead utilizes a less efficient endosomal entry pathway. This idea was supported by the identification of a suite of endosomal entry factors specific to Sdel virus by a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. A panel of host factors regulating the surface expression of ACE2 was identified for both viruses. Using a hamster model, animal-to-animal transmission with the Sdel virus was almost completely abrogated, unlike with Sfull. These findings highlight the critical role of the S1\/S2 boundary of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in modulating virus entry and transmission.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunkai Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fei Feng","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gaowei Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yin Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuanfei Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wendong Han","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Ye","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongjun Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qiliang Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Here, we explored the photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO2 (TNPs) as induced by the UV radiation, towards virus deactivation. Our preliminary results using close genetic relative of SAR-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, showed the virucidal efficacy of photoactive TNPs deposited on glass coverslips, as examined by quantitative RT-PCR and virus culture assays.

The involvement of each of these proteins and their interplays during the assembly process of this new virus are poorly-defined and are likely {beta}-coronavirus-type different. Therefore, we sought to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 behaves for its assembly by expression assays of S, in combination with E, M and\/or N. By combining biochemical and imaging assays, we showed that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S and hence its furin-mediated processing. Indeed, our imaging data revealed that S remains at ERGIC or Golgi compartments upon expression of E or M, like for SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. By studying a mutant of S, we showed that its cytoplasmic tail, and more specifically, its C-terminal retrieval motif, is required for the M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlighted that E and M induce a specific maturation of S N-glycosylation, which is observed on particles and lysates from infected cells independently of its mechanisms of intracellular retention. Finally, we showed that both M, E and N are required for optimal production of virus-like-proteins. Altogether, our results indicated that E and M proteins influence the properties of S proteins to promote assembly of viral particles. Our results therefore highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other {beta}-coronaviruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its viral particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins, though their involvement in the virion assembly remain unknown for this particular coronavirus. Here we showed that presence of E and M influence the localization and maturation of S protein, in term of cleavage and N-glycosylation maturation. Indeed, E protein is able to slow down the cell secretory pathway whereas M-induced retention of S requires the retrieval motif in S C-terminus. We also highlighted that E and M might regulate the N glycosylation maturation of S independently of its intracellular retention mechanism. Finally, we showed that the four structural proteins are required for optimal formation of virus-like particles, highlighting the involvement of N, E and M in assembly of infectious particles. Altogether, our results highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other {beta}-coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bertrand Boson","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Vincent Legros","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, VetAgro Sup"},{"author_name":"Bingjie Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Cyrille Mathieu","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois-Lo\u00efc Cosset","author_inst":"INSERM, ENS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillette","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences Pasteurien College"},{"author_name":"Solene Denolly","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wendong Han","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Ye","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongjun Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qiliang Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Inflammatory factors released as part of the  cytokine storm are thought to play a critical role in cardiac dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients4. Here we use human cardiac organoids combined with high sensitivity phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing to identify inflammatory targets inducing cardiac dysfunction. This state-of-the-art pipeline allowed rapid deconvolution of mechanisms and identification of putative therapeutics. We identify a novel interferon-{gamma} driven BRD4 (bromodomain protein 4)-fibrosis\/iNOS axis as a key intracellular mediator of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction. This axis is therapeutically targetable using BRD4 inhibitors, which promoted full recovery of function in human cardiac organoids and prevented severe inflammation and death in a cytokine-storm mouse model. The BRD inhibitor INCB054329 was the most efficacious, and is a prime candidate for drug repurposing to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and improve COVID-19 mortality in humans.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard J Mills","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sean J Humphrey","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Partrick RJ Fortuna","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Gregory A Quaife-Ryan","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lynn Devilee","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Holly K Voges","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Liam T Reynolds","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sophie Krumeich","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ellen Mathieson","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Brendan Griffen","author_inst":"Dynomics Pty Ltd"},{"author_name":"Drew M Titmarsh","author_inst":"Dynomics Inc"},{"author_name":"Mark J Smyth","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Christian R Engwerda","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kelli PA MacDonald","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bald","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David E James","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"James Edward Hudson","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Cost-effective, highly efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed. Here, we used camelid immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We discovered multiple elite Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral infection at sub-ng\/ml concentration, more potent than some of the best human neutralizing antibodies. We determined a crystal structure of such an elite neutralizing Nb in complex with RBD. Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed multiple distinct and non-overlapping epitopes and indicated an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. Structural characterization facilitated the bioengineering of novel multivalent Nb constructs into multi-epitope cocktails that achieved ultrahigh neutralization potency (IC50s as low as 0.058 ng\/ml) and may prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist lyophilization, and aerosolization. These promising agents are readily translated into efficient, cost-effective, and convenient therapeutics to help end this once-in-a-century health crisis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yufei Xiang","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Sham Nambulli","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Zhengyun Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Heng Liu","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Zhe Sang","author_inst":"The University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"W.

Although a preliminary understanding of the replication and transcription mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged, their regulation remains unclear.\n\nResultsBased on reanalysis of public data, we propose a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of replication and transcription in--but not limited to--SARS-CoV-2. The key step leading to new discoveries was the identification of the cleavage sites of nsp15--an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, encoded by CoVs. According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleaving transcription regulatory sequences in the body. The expression level of nsp15 determines the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs, which in turn change the expression level of nps15 to reach equilibrium between the replication and transcription of CoVs.\n\nConclusionsThe replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that influences the persistence of CoVs in hosts. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, and provide new clues for future studies. One important clue is that nsp15 may be an important and ideal target for the development of drugs (e.g. uridine derivatives) against CoVs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gao Shan","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Zhi","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Jin Xiufeng","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Wang Fang","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Yibo","author_inst":"Hebei Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zhou Hao","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Liu Chang","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Ruan Jishou","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Duan Guangyou","author_inst":"Qilu Normal University"},{"author_name":"Li Xin","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Drew M Titmarsh","author_inst":"Dynomics Inc"},{"author_name":"Mark J Smyth","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Christian R Engwerda","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kelli PA MacDonald","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bald","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David E James","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"James Edward Hudson","author_inst":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of {beta}2-{beta}3 and 2-{beta}5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.\n\nIMPORTANCECoronaviruses are among the largest positive-sense RNA viruses. They display a unique discontinous transcription mechanism, involving N protein as a major player. The N-NTD promote the dsRNA melting releasing the nascent sense negative strand via a poorly known mechanism of action. It specifically recognizes the body TRS conserved RNA motif located at the 5 end of each ORF. N protein has the ability to transfer the nascent RNA strand to the leader TRS. The mechanism is essential and one single mutation at the RNA binding site of the N-NTD impairs the viral replication. Here, we describe a counterintuitive mechanism of action of N-NTD based on molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic modelling of the experimental melting activity of N-NTD. This data impacts directly in the understanding of the way N protein acts in the cell and will guide future experiments.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Icaro Putinhon Caruso","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Karoline Sanches","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Da Poian","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Anderson Pinheiro","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Fabio C.
