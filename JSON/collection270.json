Methods: A total of 439 specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19. Nine serological assays developed by leading global companies (Abbott, DiaSorin, Siemens, Bio-Rad, Wantai, bioMerieux, Euroimmun) were assessed. For each test the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined weekly after symptom onset. Correlation and concordance were assessed using the Spearman and Cohen Kappa coefficients, respectively. Positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the VNT were also determined. Results: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The best correlation between antibody level and neutralizing antibody titer was found with the Euroimmun S1-based IgA assay (Spearman coefficient [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.61-0.79]). A moderate concordance (Kappa [95%CI]: 0.43[0.23-0.63]) as well as the lowest NPA (33%) was found between the Wantai Total Ab assay and the VNT. Compared to the Wantai Total Ab assay, other total Ab or IgG assays targeting the S or the RBD (bioMerieux, DiaSorin, Siemens,) were more concordant with the VNT (Kappa>0.7 for the three tests) and had a higher NPA (range: 90% to 97%). Conclusions: Although some assays presented a better concordance with VNT than others, the present findings emphasize that commercialized serological tests including those targeting the RBD cannot substitute VNT for the assessment of functional antibody response.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Hospices civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Bruno Pozzetto","author_inst":"Laboratory of Infectious Agents and Hygiene, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France"},{"author_name":"Mary-Anne Trabaud","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Escuret","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Muriel Rabilloud","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Carole Langlois-jacques","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Adele Paul","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Guibert","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Constance D'aubarde","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Amelie Massardier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Andre Boibieux","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Virginie Pitiot","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Francois Gueyffier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Fassier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Sophie Assant","author_inst":"HCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.30.20201830","rel_title":"Geospatial Analysis of Individual and Community-Level Socioeconomic Factors Impacting SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence and Outcomes","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.30.20201830","rel_abs":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority communities across the United States. We sought to disentangle individual and census tract-level sociodemographic and economic factors associated with these disparities. Methods and Findings: All adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1 and June 21, 2020 were geocoded to a census tract based on their address; hospital employees and individuals with invalid addresses were excluded. Individual (age, sex, race\/ethnicity, preferred language, insurance) and census tract-level (demographics, insurance, income, education, employment, occupation, household crowding and occupancy, built home environment, and transportation) variables were analyzed using linear mixed models predicting infection, hospitalization, and death from SARS-CoV-2. Among 57,865 individuals, per capita testing rates, individual (older age, male sex, non-White race, non-English preferred language, and non-private insurance), and census tract-level (increased population density, higher household occupancy, and lower education) measures were associated with likelihood of infection. Among those infected, individual age, sex, race, language, and insurance, and census tract-level measures of lower education, more multi-family homes, and extreme household crowding were associated with increased likelihood of hospitalization, while higher per capita testing rates were associated with decreased likelihood. Only individual-level variables (older age, male sex, Medicare insurance) were associated with increased mortality among those hospitalized. Conclusions: This study of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a major U.S. city presents the cascade of outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection within a large, multi-ethnic cohort. SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization rates, but not death rates among those hospitalized, are related to census tract-level socioeconomic characteristics including lower educational attainment and higher household crowding and occupancy, but not neighborhood measures of race, independent of individual factors.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara J Cromer","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chirag M Lakhani","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Deborah J Wexler","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sherri-Ann M Burnett-Bowie","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miriam Udler","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chirag J Patel","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Adele Paul","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Guibert","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Constance D'aubarde","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Amelie Massardier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Andre Boibieux","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Virginie Pitiot","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Francois Gueyffier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Fassier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Sophie Assant","author_inst":"HCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20201368","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, in Corsica (France), April and June 2020.","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20201368","rel_abs":"Our aim was to assess the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection after the lockdown in a sample of the Corsican population. Between 16th April and 15th June 2020, 2,312 residual sera were collected from patients having carried out a blood analysis in one of the participating laboratories. Residual sera obtained from persons of all ages were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG using the EUROIMMUN enzyme immunoassay kit for semiquantitative detection of IgG antibodies against S1 domain of viral spike protein (ELISA-S). Borderline and positive samples in ELISA-S were also tested with an in-house virus neutralization test (VNT). Prevalence values were adjusted for sex and age. A total of 1,973 residual sera samples were included in the study. The overall seroprevalence based on ELISA-S was 5.27% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.33-6.35] and 5.46% [4.51-6.57] after adjustment. Gender was not associated with IgG detection. However, significant differences were observed between age groups (p-value = 1 E-5) and particularly for people being younger than 50 years of age (Odd ratio (OR) = 2.86 95% CI [1.80- 4.53]; p-value <0.000001*).

The aim of this study was to estimate the extent to which perceptions and expectations regarding the social, economic and domestic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are associated with psychological distress, and identify some demographic, psychosocial and economic factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile. 1078 people participated in a telephone survey between May 30 and June 10, 2020. The sample is representative of the Chilean adult population. Psychological distress was assessed through a questionnaire of anxious and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). We analyze the data set using ordinary least-squares regression models, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then stratifying the sample into different groups to explore differences by gender and age. 19.2% participants displayed significant psychological distress, with moderate to severe anxiety-depression symptoms being more prevalent in women than in men (23.9% vs 14.09%, chi square 6.89, p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that being a woman, feeling lonely and isolated, living in the areas hit hardest by the pandemic and lockdown, expecting a lack of income due to having to stop working as a consequence of the pandemic, and having a history of mental health diagnosis are significantly associated with psychological distress (p < 0.05). The results of this study highlight the need to implement psychosocial programs to protect people's psychological well-being and social policies to address economic uncertainty during the current COVID-19 outbreak in Chile.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabian Duarte","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Facultad de Economia y Negocios, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Millennium Nucleus in Social Development (DESOC), Santiago, Chi"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Jimenez-Molina","author_inst":"Universidad Diego Portales; Millennium Nucleus in Social Development (DESOC), Santiago, Chile"},{"author_name":"Shirley Masse","author_inst":"UR 7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse, Corte, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Canarelli","author_inst":"Laboratoire de biologie medicale, CCF, Ajaccio, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Priet","author_inst":"Unite des Virus Emergents (UVE): Aix Marseille Univ, IRD 190, INSERM 1207, IHU Mediterranee Infection,"},{"author_name":"Marie-Helene Simeoni","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biologie medicale 2A2B, 20250, Corte, France."},{"author_name":"Remi N Charrel","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Univ."},{"author_name":"Xavier de Lamballerie","author_inst":"Ai-Marseille univ -Inserm - IRD"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Falchi","author_inst":"UR 7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse, Corte, France"},{"author_name":"Amelie Massardier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Andre Boibieux","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Virginie Pitiot","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Francois Gueyffier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Fassier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Sophie Assant","author_inst":"HCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20204396","rel_title":"Examining Australian public perceptions and behaviors towards a future COVID-19 vaccine","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20204396","rel_abs":"Background: There is an indication that vaccine(s) for COVID-19 could be available by early 2021. As immunisation program launches have previously demonstrated, it is essential that careful planning occurs now to ensure the readiness of the public for a COVID-19 vaccine. As part of that process, this study aimed to understand the public perceptions regarding a future COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Participants generally held positive views towards vaccination. Eighty percent (n=1143) agreed with the statement that getting myself vaccinated for COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection. Females (614, 83%) were more likely to agree with the statement than males (529, 78%) (aOR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8); P=0.029), while 90.9% aged 70 and above agreed compared to 76.6% aged 18-29 year old (aOR=2.3 (95% CI:1.2-4.1); 0.008). Agreement was also higher for those with a self-reported chronic disease (aOR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0); P=0.043) and among those who held private health insurance (aOR=1.7 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3); P<0.001). Beyond individual perceptions, 78% stated that their decision to vaccinate would be supported by family and friends Conclusion: This study presents an early indication of public perceptions towards a future COVID-19 vaccine and represents a starting point for mapping vaccine perceptions. To support an effective launch of these new vaccines, governments need to use this time to understand the communities concerns and to identify the strategies that will support engagement.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Holly Seale","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Anita E Heywood","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Julie Leask","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Meru Sheel","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"David N Durrheim","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Bolsewicz","author_inst":"National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance"},{"author_name":"Rajneesh Kaur","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Xavier de Lamballerie","author_inst":"Ai-Marseille univ -Inserm - IRD"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Falchi","author_inst":"UR 7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse, Corte, France"},{"author_name":"Amelie Massardier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Andre Boibieux","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Virginie Pitiot","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Francois Gueyffier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Fassier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Sophie Assant","author_inst":"HCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20204289","rel_title":"Identification of biological correlates associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20204289","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with participants recruited from Italy and Spain by an international consortium group. Methods: Summary GWAS statistics for 1610 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and 2205 controls were downloaded. In the current study, we analyzed the summary statistics with the information of loci and p-values for 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using gene ontology analysis to determine the top biological processes implicated in respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Results: We considered the top 708 SNPs, using a p-value cutoff of 5x10-5, which were mapped to the nearest genes, leading to 144 unique genes. The list of genes was input into a curated database to conduct gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. The top-ranked biological processes were wound healing, epithelial structure maintenance, muscle system processes, and cardiac-relevant biological processes with a false discovery rate < 0.05. In the PPI analysis, the largest connected network consisted of 8 genes. Through literature search, 7 out of the 8 genes were found to be implicated in both pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Conclusion: Gene ontology and protein-protein interaction analyses identified cardio-pulmonary processes that may partially explain the risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jung Hun Oh","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Allen Tannenbaum","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Deasy","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Meru Sheel","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"David N Durrheim","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Bolsewicz","author_inst":"National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance"},{"author_name":"Rajneesh Kaur","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Xavier de Lamballerie","author_inst":"Ai-Marseille univ -Inserm - IRD"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Falchi","author_inst":"UR 7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse, Corte, France"},{"author_name":"Amelie Massardier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Andre Boibieux","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Virginie Pitiot","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Francois Gueyffier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Fassier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Sophie Assant","author_inst":"HCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20204172","rel_title":"The Challenge of Forecasting Demand of Medical Resources and Supplies During a Pandemic: A Comparative Evaluation of Three Surge Calculators for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20204172","rel_abs":"Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, there has been a public health debate concerning medical resources and supplies including hospital beds, intensive care units (ICU), ventilators, and Protective Personal Equipment (PPE). Forecasting COVID-19 dissemination has played a key role in informing healthcare professionals and governments on how to manage overburdened healthcare systems. However, forecasting during the pandemic remained challenging and sometimes highly controversial. Here, we highlight this challenge by performing a comparative evaluation for the estimations obtained from three COVID-19 surge calculators under different social distancing approaches, taking Lebanon as a case study. Despite discrepancies in estimations, the three surge calculators used herein agree that there will be a relative shortage in the capacity of medical resources and a significant surge in PPE demand as the social distancing policy is removed. Our results underscore the importance of implementing containment interventions including social distancing in alleviating the demand for medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of any medication or vaccine. It is said that ''All models are wrong, but some are useful'', in this paper we highlight that it is even more useful to employ several models.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amina A.

Understanding the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other novel human coronaviruses is imperative in designing effective control measures. Viral load contributes to the transmission potential of the virus, but findings around the temporal viral load dynamics, particularly the peak of transmission potential, remain inconsistent across studies due to limited sample sizes. Methods: We searched PubMed through June 8th 2020 and collated unique individual-patient data (IPD) from papers reporting temporal viral load and shedding data from coronaviruses. We analyzed viral load trajectories using a series of generalized additive models, and the duration of viral shedding by fitting log-normal models accounting for interval censoring. Results: We identified 115 relevant papers and obtained data from 66 (57.4%) - representing a total of 1198 patients across 14 countries. SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset and remains elevated for up to three weeks, while MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral loads peak after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV had median viral shedding durations of 4.8, 4.2, and 1.2 days after symptom onset. Disease severity, age, and specimen type all have an effect on viral load, but sex does not. Discussion: Using a pooled analysis of the largest collection of IPD on viral load to date, we are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to -- not at -- symptom onset. Detailed estimation of the trajectories of viral load and virus shedding can inform the transmission, mathematical modeling, and clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amy E Benefield","author_inst":"University of Colorado, Boulder"},{"author_name":"Laura A Skrip","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Andrea Clement","author_inst":"University of Colorado, Boulder"},{"author_name":"Rachel A Althouse","author_inst":"Legacy High School, Marysville, WA"},{"author_name":"Stewart Chang","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rajneesh Kaur","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Xavier de Lamballerie","author_inst":"Ai-Marseille univ -Inserm - IRD"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Falchi","author_inst":"UR 7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse, Corte, France"},{"author_name":"Amelie Massardier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Andre Boibieux","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Virginie Pitiot","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Francois Gueyffier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Fassier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Sophie Assant","author_inst":"HCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20203125","rel_title":"Seroprevalence and Risk Factors of SARS CoV-2 in Health Care Workers of Tertiary-Care Hospitals in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","rel_date":"2020-09-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20203125","rel_abs":"Background: High number of SARS CoV2 infected patients has overburdened healthcare delivery system, particularly in low-income countries. In the recent past many studies from the developed countries have been published on the prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies and the risk factors of COVID 19 in healthcare-workers but little is known from developing countries. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibody and risk factors for seropositivity in HCWs in tertiary care hospitals of Peshawar city, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Pakistan. Findings: The overall seroprevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies was 30.7% (CI, 27.8 to 33.6) in 1011 HCWs. Laboratory technicians had the highest seropositivity (50.0%, CI, 31.8 to 68.1). Risk analysis revealed that wearing face-mask and observing social-distancing within a family could reduce the risk (OR:0.67. p<0.05) and (OR:0.73. p<0.05) while the odds of seropositivity were higher among those attending funeral and visiting local-markets (OR:1.83. p<0.05) and (OR:1.66. p<0.01). In Univariable analysis, being a nursing staff and a paramedical staff led to higher risk of seropositivity (OR:1.58. p< 0.05), (OR:1.79. p< 0.05). Fever (OR:2.36, CI, 1.52 to 3.68) and loss of smell (OR:2.95, CI: 1.46 to 5.98) were significantly associated with increased risk of seropositivity (p<0.01). Among the seropositive HCWs, 165 (53.2%) had no symptoms at all while 145 (46.8%) had one or more symptoms. Interpretation: The high prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies in HCWs warrants for better training and use of protective measure to reduce their risk. Early detection of asymptomatic HCWs may be of special importance because they are likely to be potential threat to others during the active phase of viremia.

To date, there has been over thirty-three million diagnosed infections, and over one million deaths. No vaccine or targeted therapeutics are currently available. We previously identified a human monoclonal antibody, 47D11, capable of cross-neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and the related 2002\/2003 SARS-CoV in vitro, and preventing SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia in a hamster model. Here we present the structural basis of its neutralization mechanism. We describe cryo-EM structures of trimeric SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomains in complex with the 47D11 Fab. These data reveal that 47D11 binds specifically to the closed conformation of the receptor binding domain, distal to the ACE2 binding site. The CDRL3 stabilises the N343 glycan in an upright conformation, exposing a conserved and mutationally constrained hydrophobic pocket, into which the CDRH3 loop inserts two aromatic residues. Interestingly, 47D11 preferentially selects for the partially open conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, suggesting that it could be used effectively in combination with other antibodies that target the exposed receptor-binding motif. Taken together, these results expose a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and provide a structural roadmap for the development of 47D11 as a prophylactic or post-exposure therapy for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliette Fedry","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Daniel L.

Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are antisense agents composed of a phosphordiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking.\n\nObjectives and MethodsFive PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 5-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was evaluated with an ATP-based method and viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR and TCID50 infectivity assays.\n\nResultsPPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5-terminal region or the leader transcription regulatory sequence-region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly efficacious, reducing viral titers by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 hours post-infection, in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner.\n\nConclusionThe data indicate that PPMO have the ability to potently and specifically suppress SARS-CoV-2 growth and are promising candidates for further pre-clinical development.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Rosenke","author_inst":"1Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT."},{"author_name":"Shanna Leventhal","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT."},{"author_name":"Hong Moulton","author_inst":"2Department of Biomedical Sciences, Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR."},{"author_name":"Susan Hatlevig","author_inst":"2Department of Biomedical Sciences, Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR."},{"author_name":"David Hawman","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT."},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT."},{"author_name":"David A.

Their complexes cluster into three groups, which systematically form either heterotrimers or heterotetramers or both, exhibiting distinct topologies. Moreover, even at high protein concentrations mainly heterotetramers are observed for SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8.

Recent data showed that D614G genotype of the virus is highly infectious and responsible for almost all infection for 2nd wave. Despite of multiple vaccine development initiatives, there are currently no report that has addressed this critical variant D614G as vaccine candidate. Here we report the development of an mRNA-LNP vaccine considering the D614G variant and characterization of the vaccine in preclinical trial. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data with spike protein as probe and competitive neutralization with RBD and S2 domain revealed that immunization generated specific antibody pools against the whole extracellular domain (RBD and S2) of the spike protein. The anti-sera and purified IgGs from immunized mice on day 7 and 14 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells in a dose dependent manner. Importantly, immunization protected mice lungs from pseudovirus entry and cytopathy. The immunologic responses have been implicated by a balanced and stable population of CD4+ cells with a Th1 bias. The IgG2a to IgG1 and (IgG2a+IgG2b) to (IgG1+IgG3) ratios were found 1{+\/-}0.2 and 1.24{+\/-}0.1, respectively. These values are comparatively higher than relevant values for other published SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in development,1, 2 and suggesting higher viral clearance capacity for our vaccine. The data suggested great promise for immediate translation of the technology to the clinic.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juwel Chandra Baray","author_inst":"Globe Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Md.

Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with a S1\/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion is selected for in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures but selected against in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. We find this selective advantage depends on expression of the cell surface protease, TMPRSS2, that allows virus entry independent of endosomes thus avoiding antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1\/S2 furin CS was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals. Thus, the polybasic CS is a key determinant for efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas P.

We therefore performed an in-depth computational analysis of the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins in infected HEK293 cells published by Gordon et al. to reveal processes that are potentially affected by the virus and putative protein binding sites. Specifically, we performed a set of network-based functional and sequence motif enrichment analyses on SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins and on a PPI network generated by supplementing viral-host PPIs with known interactions. Using a novel implementation of our GoNet algorithm, we identified 329 Gene Ontology terms for which the SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins are significantly clustered in the network. Furthermore, we present a novel protein sequence motif discovery approach, LESMoN-Pro, that identified 9 amino acid motifs for which the associated proteins are clustered in the network. Together, these results provide insights into the processes and sequence motifs that are putatively implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection and could lead to potential therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Nadeau","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Soroush Shahryari Fard","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Amit Scheer","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Emily Hashimoto-Roth","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Dallas Nygard","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Iryna Abramchuk","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Yun-En Chung","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Steffany A.

A limited subset of ISGs were found to control viral infection, including endosomal factors that inhibited viral entry, nucleic acid binding proteins that suppressed viral RNA synthesis, and a highly enriched cluster of ER and Golgi-resident ISGs that inhibited viral translation and egress. These included the type II integral membrane protein BST2\/tetherin, which was found to impede viral release, and is targeted for immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 Orf7a protein.

We propose herein to evaluate the impact of implementing conservative management as an alternative approach to surgical appendectomy in the treatment of proven acute appendicitis during COVID19 pandemic. Methods Our study is a prospective multicenter study that includes a cohort of 160 patients admitted to the surgical departments in both Tawam Hospital and Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE, for the period from February 2020 till July 2020. Results Our results showed that 56 of our patients (35%) were treated conservatively, while the other 104 (65%) underwent operative management. There was a significant decrease in length of hospital stay (LOS) (2.32 days) among the first group compared to the second (2.8 days). Also, short term follow-up showed that 90% of those patients did not require further operative intervention or developed any serious complications. Out of the 110 patients that were swapped for COVID19, nine (8.18%) were confirmed to be positive. Our protocol was to avoid surgical management for COVID19 positive patients unless indicated. This resulted in (8\/9) of COVID19 positive patients to be treated conservatively. Follow up was achieved by using telemedicine-based follow-up with the aim of empowering social distancing and reducing risk of viral exposure to patients as well as the health care providers. In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of conservative management in treating patients with acute appendicitis who were COVID19 positive is a safe and feasible approach that maybe essential in reducing viral transmission risks as well as avoiding operative risks on COVID19 positive patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatima Y.

Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies plays an important role in understanding and controlling the pandemics, notably through epidemiological surveillance. Well validated and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed. We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, EUA-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity towards sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 pre-pandemic healthy donors was [&ge;] 99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. The positive percent agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR reached 100% at [&ge;] 16 days (VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and [&ge;] 32 days (VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG) of symptom onset. Combined IgM\/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients. Altogether, the VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are highly specific and sensitive serological tests suitable for the reliable monitoring of past SARS-CoV-2 infections and for seroepidemiology investigations.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"NATHALIE RENARD","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"SOIZIC DANIEL","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"NADEGE CAYET","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"MATTHIEU PECQUET","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biologie, Centre Hospitalier Saint Joseph Saint Luc, Lyon, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"FREDERIQUE RAYMOND","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"SYLVIE PONS","author_inst":"Laboratoire commun de recherche Hospices Civils de Lyon - BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"JULIEN LUPO","author_inst":"Institut de Biologie Structurale (IBS), CEA, CNRS, UNIVERSTE GRENOBLE ALPES; Laboratoire de Virologie, CHU Grenoble, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"CAROLE TOURNEUR","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"CATHERINE PRETIS","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"GUILLAUME GEREZ","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"PATRICK BLASCO","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"MAXIME COMBE","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"IMEN CANOVA","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"MYLENE LESENECHAL","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"FRANCK BERTHIER","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"Fulvio Adorni","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Technologies - CNR"},{"author_name":"Matthew Urbanowski","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Megan L Shaw","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Max W Chang","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Matthew Frieman","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Trey Ideker","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Judd F.

However, the mechanisms mediating these processes remain unclear. Methods We performed multicolor staining for viral proteins, and lineage cell markers to identify SARS-CoV-2 tropism and to define the lung pathobiology in postmortem tissues from five patients with fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. Findings The lung parenchyma showed severe DAD with thromboemboli in all cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in an extensive range of cells including alveolar epithelial type II\/pneumocyte type II (AT2) cells (HT2-280), ciliated cells (tyr--tubulin), goblet cells (MUC5AC), club-like cells (MUC5B) and endothelial cells (CD31 and CD34). Greater than 90% of infiltrating immune cells were positive for viral proteins including macrophages and monocytes (CD68 and CD163), neutrophils (ELA-2), natural killer (NK) cells (CD56), B-cells (CD19 and CD20), and T-cells (CD3{varepsilon}). Most but not all infected cells were positive for the viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). The numbers of infected and ACE2-positive cells correlated with the extent of tissue damage. The infected tissues exhibited low numbers of B-cells and abundant CD3{varepsilon}+ T-cells consisting of mainly T helper cells (CD4), few cytotoxic T cells (CTL, CD8), and no T regulatory cell (FOXP3). Antigen presenting molecule HLA-DR of B and T cells was abundant in all cases. Robust interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression was present in most uninfected and infected cells, with higher expression levels observed in cases with more tissue damage. Interpretation In lung tissues from severely affected COVID-19 patients, there is evidence for broad SARS-CoV-2 cell tropisms, activation of immune cells, and clearance of immunosuppressive cells, which could contribute to severe tissue damage, thromboemboli, excess inflammation and compromised adaptive immune responses.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suzane Ramos da Silva","author_inst":"Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsbur"},{"author_name":"Enguo Ju","author_inst":"Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsbur"},{"author_name":"Wen Meng","author_inst":"Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsbur"},{"author_name":"Alberto E.

Placentas from pregnancies complicated with chorioamnionitis (ChA), exhibited increased expression of ACE2 mRNA. Treatment of 2nd trimester placental explants with LPS, induced an acute increase in cytokine expression followed by ACE2 mRNA. Placental ACE2 protein localized to syncytiotrophoblast, in fetal blood vessels and M1\/M2 macrophage and neutrophils within the villous stroma. Increased numbers of M1 macrophage and neutrophils were present in the placenta of ChA pregnancies. Maternal peripheral immune cells (mainly granulocytes and monocytes) express the ACE2 mRNA and protein. These data suggest that in COVID19 positive pregnancies complicated by ChA, ACE2 positive immune cells have the potential to traffic SARS-CoV-2 virus to the placenta and increase the risk of vertical transmission to the placenta\/fetus.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phatcharawan Lye","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Caroline Dunk","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Zhang","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yanxing Wei","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jittanan Nakpu","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Hirotaka Hamada","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Guinever Imperio","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Enrrico Bloise","author_inst":"Department of Morphology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Matthews","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Stephen James Lye","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Molecular and Cell-Based Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsbur"},{"author_name":"Shou-Jiang Gao","author_inst":"Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsbur"},{"author_name":"MYLENE LESENECHAL","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"FRANCK BERTHIER","author_inst":"BIOMERIEUX"},{"author_name":"Fulvio Adorni","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Technologies - CNR"},{"author_name":"Matthew Urbanowski","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Megan L Shaw","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Max W Chang","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Matthew Frieman","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Trey Ideker","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Judd F.

Methods: We employed an agent-based stochastic network simulation model, where Covid-19 progresses across census tracts according to a variant of SEIR. We considered a mask order that was initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed Covid-19 case. We evaluated scenarios where wearing a mask reduces transmission and susceptibility by 50% or 80%; an individual wears a mask with a probability of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, or 100%. Results: If 60% of the population wears masks that are 50% effective, this decreases the cumulative infection attack rate (CAR) by 25%, the peak prevalence by 51%, and the population mortality by 25%. If 100% of people wear masks (or 60% wear masks that are 80% effective), this decreases the CAR by 38%, the peak prevalence by 67%, and the population mortality by 40%. Conclusions: After community transmission is present, masks can significantly reduce infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erik Rosenstrom","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Buse Oruc Aglar","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Julie S.

Here we presented sequencing data of E. coli sample from GenoCare 1600 with consensus accuracy reaches 99.99%. We also demonstrated sequencing of microbial mixtures and COVID-19 samples from throat swabs. Our data show accurate quantitation of microbial, sensitive identification of SARS-CoV-2 virus and detection of variants confirmed by Sanger sequencing.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Bin Liu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Meirong Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Zefei Jiang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Zhiliang Zhou","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Ping Wu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Meng Zhang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Huan Jin","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Linsen Li","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Liuyan Lu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Qi Wang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Huan Shang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Bing Xie","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Xia Lin","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Weiyue Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Ruitao Sun","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Guangming Wang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jiao Zheng","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jifang Qi","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Bo Yang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Dexia Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lidong Zeng","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Gailing Li","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Hui Lv","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Nannan Zhao","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhou","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jinsen Cai","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Siyu Liu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Luo","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yanhua Zhang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yongyi Lu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jicai Fan","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Haitao Dan","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Xuesen He","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lichun Liu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yan Feng","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jianglin Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Wei Huang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lei Sun","author_inst":"Genemind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Qin Yan","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.28.20203406","rel_title":"Transfer transcriptomic signatures for infectious diseases","rel_date":"2020-09-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.28.20203406","rel_abs":"The modulation of the transcriptome is among the earliest responses to infection, and vaccination. However, defining transcriptome signatures of disease is challenging because logistic, technical and cost factors limit the size and representativeness of samples in clinical studies. These limitations lead to poor performance of signatures when applied to new datasets or varying study settings. Using a novel approach, we leverage existing transcriptomic signatures as classifiers in unseen datasets from prospective studies, with the goal of predicting individual outcomes. Machine learning allowed the identification of sets of genes, which we name transfer transcriptomic signatures, that are predictive across diverse datasets and\/or species (rhesus to humans) and that are also suggestive of activated pathways and cell type composition. We demonstrate the usefulness of transfer signatures in two use cases: progression of latent to active tuberculosis, and severity of COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 infection. The broad significance of our work lies in the concept that a small set of archetypal human immunophenotypes, captured by transfer signatures, can explain a larger set of responses to diverse diseases.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia di Iulio","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Istvan Bartha","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Roberto Spreafico","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Herbert W Virgin","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Amalio Telenti","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ping Wu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Meng Zhang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Huan Jin","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Linsen Li","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Liuyan Lu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Qi Wang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Huan Shang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Bing Xie","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Xia Lin","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Weiyue Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Ruitao Sun","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Guangming Wang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jiao Zheng","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jifang Qi","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Bo Yang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Dexia Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lidong Zeng","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Gailing Li","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Hui Lv","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Nannan Zhao","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhou","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jinsen Cai","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Siyu Liu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Luo","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yanhua Zhang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yongyi Lu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jicai Fan","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Haitao Dan","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Xuesen He","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lichun Liu","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Yan Feng","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Jianglin Chen","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Wei Huang","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Lei Sun","author_inst":"Genemind Biosciences Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Qin Yan","author_inst":"GeneMind Biosciences Company Limited"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.28.20202929","rel_title":"T cell assays differentiate clinical and subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections from cross-reactive antiviral responses","rel_date":"2020-09-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.28.20202929","rel_abs":"A major issue in identification of protective T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 lies in distinguishing people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those with cross-reactive immunity generated by exposure to other coronaviruses. We characterised SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses in 168 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 118 seronegative subjects without known SARS-CoV-2 exposure using a range of T cell assays that differentially capture immune cell function. Strong ex vivo ELISpot and proliferation responses to multiple antigens (including M, NP and ORF3) were found in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were rare in pre-pandemic and unexposed seronegative subjects. However, seronegative doctors with high occupational exposure and recent COVID-19 compatible illness showed patterns of T cell responses characteristic of infection, indicating that these readouts are highly sensitive. By contrast, over 90% of convalescent or unexposed people showed proliferation and cellular lactate responses to spike subunits S1\/S2, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive T cell populations. The detection of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critically dependent on the choice of assay and antigen. Memory responses to specific non-spike proteins provides a method to distinguish recent infection from pre-existing immunity in exposed populations.","rel_num_authors":63,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ane Ogbe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Barbara Kronsteiner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Donal T Skelly","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Pace","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anthony Brown","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emily Adland","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kareena Adair","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Hossain Delowar Akhter","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Serat-E Ali","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Adrienn Angyal","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"M.

We describe the challenges and constraints in choosing a proven, scalable, and easy-to-implement decontamination solution. We discuss the heat treatment and particle filtration efficiency measurement experiments done to validate a decontamination treatment protocol at a target temperature of 70{degrees}C for a duration of 60 minutes, and the scaling up of this method using a standard hot drying cabinet at the hospital. The logistics of ensuring optimal utilization of the decontamination facility without compromising on basic safety principles are detailed. Our method relies on equipment available in standard hospitals, is simple to set-up, scalable, and can be easily replicated in low-resource settings. We further believe such limited reuse strategies, even in times of abundant N95 mask availability, would not only be cost-saving but also be environmentally responsible in reducing the amount of

the major complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet optimal respiratory support strategies are uncertain. Objectives To describe outcomes with high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in COVID-19 AHRF and identify individual factors associated with failure. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with HFNC and\/or NIPPV to describe rates of success (live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI)), and identify characteristics associated with failure (ETI and\/or in-hospital mortality) using Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models. Results A total of 331 and 747 patients received HFNC and NIPPV as the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5%) in the HFNC cohort and 167 (22.4%) in the NIPPV cohort were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06-1.84), respectively, and among those with lower oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2\/FiO2) ratio at HFNC and NIPPV initiation (sHR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively). Conclusions A significant proportion of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory modalities for COVID-19 AHRF achieved successful discharge without requiring ETI, with lower success rates among those with cardiovascular disease or more severe hypoxia. The role of non-invasive respiratory modalities in COVID-19 related AHRF requires further consideration.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Gennie Wang","author_inst":"Icahn
