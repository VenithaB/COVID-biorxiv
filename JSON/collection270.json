Here, we used data collected from contact tracing during the lockdown in Punjab, a major state in India, to quantify this heterogeneity, and to examine implications for transmission dynamics. We found evidence of heterogeneity acting at multiple levels: in the number of potentially infectious contacts per index case, and in the per-contact risk of infection. Incorporating these findings in simple mathematical models of disease transmission reveals that these heterogeneities act in combination to strongly influence transmission dynamics. Standard approaches, such as representing heterogeneity through secondary case distributions, could be biased by neglecting these underlying interactions between heterogeneities. We discuss implications for policy, and for more efficient contact tracing in resource-constrained settings such as India. Our results highlight how contact tracing, an important public health measure, can also provide important insights into epidemic spread and control.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nimalan Arinaminpathy","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jishnu Das","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Tyler McCormick","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Partha Mukhopadhyay","author_inst":"Centre for Policy Research, India"},{"author_name":"Neelanjan Sircar","author_inst":"Ashoka University, and Centre for Policy Research, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193508","rel_title":"Slight reduction in SARS-CoV-2 exposure viral load due to masking results in a significant reduction in transmission with widespread implementation","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20193508","rel_abs":"Masks are a vital tool for limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population. Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~50%. Slight increases in masking relative to current levels would reduce the reproductive number substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks that reduce transmission risk by 50% will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who do get infected, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy is only effective for this indication as post-exposure prophylaxis, specifically if given to ~50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Goyal","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel B Reeves","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"E Fabian Cardozo Ojeda","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Bryan T Mayer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Schiffer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20191031","rel_title":"A dual antigen ELISA allows the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in a low transmission setting","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20191031","rel_abs":"Estimates of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been hampered by inadequate assay sensitivity and specificity.

Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, NSP1, for shutting down host translation. Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shilpa Rao","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ian Hoskins","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Daniela Garcia","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Tori Tonn","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Hakan Ozadam","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Elif Sarinay Cenik","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Can Cenik","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Samina Nazir","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Carola Vinuesa","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cook","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.295824","rel_title":"SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein forms condensates with viral genomic RNA","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.295824","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes COVID-19, a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with unstructured RNA, it forms mesh like-structures with viral RNA strands that contain secondary structure elements. Cross-linking mass spectrometry identified an intrinsically-disordered region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. By screening 1,200 FDA approved drugs in vitro, we identified a kinase inhibitor nilotinib, which affects the morphology of N condensates in vitro and disrupts phase separation of the N protein in vivo. These results indicate that the N protein compartmentalizes viral RNA in infected cells through liquid-liquid phase separation, and this process can be disrupted by a possible drug candidate.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Jack","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Luke S Ferro","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Michael J Trnka","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Eddie Wehri","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Amrut Nadgir","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Katelyn Costa","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Julia Schaletzky","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Yildiz","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Carola Vinuesa","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cook","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.296327","rel_title":"The Coronavirus Network Explorer: Mining a large-scale knowledge graph for effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host cell function","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.296327","rel_abs":"Building on recent work that identified human host proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in the context of an affinity-purification mass spectrometry screen, we use a machine learning-based approach to connect the viral proteins to relevant biological functions and diseases in a large-scale knowledge graph derived from the biomedical literature.

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected up to 26 million people worldwide; yet, there is no clinically approved drug or vaccine available. Therefore, a rapid and coordinated effort to re-purpose clinically approved drugs that prevent or disrupt these critical entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with human ACE2, could potentially accelerate the identification and clinical advancement of prophylactic and\/or treatment options against COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures against viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. Herein, we discovered that Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), and its progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), both clinically approved drugs are potent effective modulators of the key interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2. We also found that both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect at micromolar concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH; we report for the first time that the BHH and AMB pharmacophore has the capacity to target and modulate yet another key protein-protein interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways into host cells. Altogether, the potent efficacy, excellent safety and pharmacologic profile of both drugs along with their affordability and availability, makes them promising candidates for drug repurposing as possible prophylactic and\/or treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omonike A Olaleye","author_inst":"Texas Southern University"},{"author_name":"Manvir Kaur","author_inst":"Texas Southern University"},{"author_name":"Collins Chidi Onyenaka","author_inst":"Texas Southern University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Quake","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Carlos Simon","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Valencia"},{"author_name":"Jeff Green","author_inst":"QIAGEN"},{"author_name":"Julia Schaletzky","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Yildiz","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Carola Vinuesa","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cook","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"pharmacology and toxicology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.293951","rel_title":"Non-permissive SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural cells in the developing human brain and neurospheres","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.293951","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially described as a viral infection of the respiratory tract.

Here, we investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain from an infant patient deceased from COVID-19. The susceptibility to virus infection was compatible with the expression levels of viral receptor ACE2, which is increased in the ChP in comparison to other brain areas. To better comprehend the dynamics of the viral infection in neural cells, we exposed human neurospheres to SARS-CoV-2. Similarly to the human tissue, we found viral RNA in neurospheres, although viral particles in the culture supernatant were not infective. Based on our observations in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 does not generate productive infection in developing neural cells and that infection of ChP weakens the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier allowing viruses, immune cells, and cytokines to access the CNS, causing neural damage in the young brain.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ismael C.

The aim of this study was to identify patients who were likely to test positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 during hospitalization by comparing COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were [&ge;]18 years old and underwent COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction test because they presented with symptoms thought to be due to COVID-19. The Poisson regression analysis was conducted after clinical presentation, demographic, medical co-morbidities, laboratory and chest image data was retrieved from the medical records. Results: Charts of 277 and 35 COVID-19 negative and positive patients respectively were analyzed. Dyspnea (61%) was the most common symptom among COVID-19 negative patients, while 83% and 77% COVID-19 positive patients had cough and fever respectively. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present initially with cough [1.082 (1.022 - 1.145)] and fever [1.066 (1.013 - 1.122)], besides being males [1.066 (1.013 - 1.123)] and 50 to 69 years old [1.090 (1.019 - 1.166)]. Dyspnea, weakness, lymphopenia and bilateral chest image abnormality were not associated with COVID-19 positivity. COVID-19 positive patients were less likely to have non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.934 (0.893 - 0.976)], human immunodeficiency virus [0.847 (0.763 - 0.942)] and heart failure history [0.945 (0.908 - 0.984)]. Other chronic medical problems (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease) were not associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Cough and fever are better predictors of symptomatic COVID-19 positivity during hospitalization. Despite published studies reporting a high prevalence of lymphopenia among COVID-19 positive patients, lymphopenia is not associated with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Northwestern HCW SARS-CoV-2 Serology Cohort Study. The Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay was used to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to COVID-19) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, healthcare delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status. Results: 6,510 HCWs, including 1,794 nurses, and 904 non-patient facing administrators participated. The majority were women (79.6%), 74.9% were white, 9.7% were Asian, 7.3% were Hispanic and 3.1% were Black. The crude prevalence rate of seropositivity was 4.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6%-5.2%). Out-of-hospital exposure to COVID-19 occurred in 9.3% of HCWs and was strongly associated with seropositivity (OR=4.7, 95% CI: 3.5-6.4). When compared to administrators, nursing was the only occupation group with a significantly higher adjusted-odds (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9) of seropositivity. Exposure to COVID-19 patients was reported by 37.8% of participants and was associated with higher positivity than those not exposed (OR= 2.2, 95% CI: 1.6-3.0). Being exposed to patients receiving high-flow oxygen therapy, and hemodialysis also remained significantly associated with a 45% and 57% higher odds for seropositive status, respectively. Conclusions: Exposure to COVID-19 patients, and longer duration patient therapies were each associated with higher risk for seropositive status; however, the community burden of COVID-19 remains a significant source of exposure to SARS CoV-2 infection among HCWs in Chicago.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Wilkins","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Lucia Gray","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amisha Wallia","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hirschhorn","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Teresa Zembower","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joyce Ho","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naomi Kalume","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ojoma Agbo","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Zhu","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Laura Rasmussen-Torvic","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sadiya Khan","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Carnethon","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Huffman","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlesnika Evans","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20191445","rel_title":"RAAS blockers and region-specific variations in COVID-19 outcomes: findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-09-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20191445","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved as a global crisis with high mortality seen in elderly and people with cardiometabolic diseases. The use of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers in these patients is known to enhance the expression of ACE-2, the chief binding receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and may potentially enhance infectivity. Objective: To provide a pooled estimate of the effect of RAAS blocker usage on COVID-19 outcomes. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE\/PubMed and Google Scholar) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest. The last search was conducted on 9th July 2020. Study Selection: Studies reporting data on RAAS blocker use and COVID-19 mortality and severity were included in the review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Mortality data and severity data including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, steroid use and acute kidney injury (AKI) were recorded. Pooled Odds ratio (OR) estimates were reported with 95% CIs and level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of mortality in users of RAAS blockers with respect to non-users was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, steroid use, and AKI in users with respect to non-users of RAAS blockers were the secondary outcomes. Results: Of 1348 articles identified, 48 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26432 patients from 31 studies included in mortality analysis and 20127 patients from 23 studies included in severity analysis. Majority of the studies (41.6%) were from China. No increased risk of mortality (Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65-1.26), I2=89%) or severity (Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79-1.46), I2=88%) was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension (pooled OR 0.63 (0.46-0.86), I2=58%). Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was found to be high for Europeans (Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52-2.85), I2=77%) and US patients (Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62-2.17) in users of RAAS-blockers. A nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization, two times higher risk of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was observed in US patients on RAAS blockers. No net effect on mortality and severity outcomes was seen in Chinese patients. RAAS blocker usage did not have any effect on corticosteroid use and AKI in Chinese patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of RAAS blockers is not associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Reduced mortality is seen in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and therefore the drugs should be continued in this subset. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Pharmacogenomic differences may explain the ethnicity related variations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Upinder Kaur","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Sankha Shubhra Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Tejas K Patel","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Gorakhpur"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hirschhorn","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Teresa Zembower","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joyce Ho","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naomi Kalume","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ojoma Agbo","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Zhu","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Laura Rasmussen-Torvic","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sadiya Khan","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Carnethon","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Huffman","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlesnika Evans","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20191940","rel_title":"Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from airways in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses","rel_date":"2020-09-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20191940","rel_abs":"To understand the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients we simultaneously assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, live infectious virus in the airways, and virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in sera in 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Samples were pre-treated with Triton X-100 to inactivate potential virus without affecting antibody detection. Our in-house ELISA performed as well as the commercial EUROIMMUN and Ortho assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and\/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and\/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and\/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019).

However, more accurate forecasts are often needed at near term for planning and staffing. We present our early results from a systemic analysis of short-term adjustment of epidemiological modeling of COVID 19 pandemic in US during March-April 2020. Our analysis includes the importance of various types of features for short term adjustment of the predictions. In addition, we explore the potential of data augmentation to address the data limitation for an emerging pandemic. Following published literature, we employ data augmentation via clustering of regions and evaluate a number of clustering strategies to identify early patterns from the data. From our early analysis, we used CovidActNow as our underlying epidemiological model and found that the most impactful features for the one-day prediction horizon are population density, workers in commuting flow, number of deaths in the day prior to prediction date, and the autoregressive features of new COVID-19 cases from three previous dates of the prediction. Interestingly, we also found that counties clustered with New York County resulted in best preforming model with maximum of R2= 0.90 and minimum of R2= 0.85 for state-based and COVID-based clustering strategy, respectively.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah KEFAYATI","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Hu Huang","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Prithwish Chakraborty","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Fred Roberts","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Raman Srinivasan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Sayali Pethe","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Piyush Madan","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Ajay Deshpande","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Jianying Hu","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Jackson","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashwin Aravindakshan","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rn Boehnke","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Gholami","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh Nayak","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Raman Srinivasan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Sayali Pethe","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Piyush Madan","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Ajay Deshpande","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Jianying Hu","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Jackson","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

A synthesis of this large corpus of data is needed. Purpose: To evaluate the quality of serological studies and provide a global picture of seroprevalence across demographic and occupational groups, and to provide guidance for conducting better serosurveys. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN and Wellcome were searched for English-language papers published from December 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Study selection: Serological studies that evaluated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Data extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies. Data Synthesis: Most of 178 serological studies, representing tests in >800,000 individuals, identified were of low quality. Close contacts and high-risk healthcare workers had higher seroprevalence of 22.9% (95% CI: 11.1-34.7%) and 14.9% (4.8-25.0%), compared to low-risk healthcare workers and general population of 5.5% (4.6-6.4%) and 6.3% (5.5-7.1%). Generally, young people (0-20 yrs) were less likely to be seropositive compared to the middle-aged (21-55 yrs) populations (RR, 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-0.8). Seroprevalence correlated with clinical COVID-19 reports with 10 (range: 2 to 34) infections per confirmed COVID-19 case. Limitations: Some heterogeneity cannot be well explained quantitatively. Conclusions: The overall quality of seroprevalence studies examined was low. The relatively low seroprevalence among general populations suggest that in most settings, antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached. Given that ratio of infections to confirmed cases is on the same order of magnitude across different locales, reported case numbers may help provide insights into the proportion of the population infected.

To apprehend the transmission of COVID-19 and the improvement of air quality, we have studied air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and NO2), CO2 emission, and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) in the extremely polluted and densely populated Southeast Asian megacity Dhaka, Bangladesh from March to June 2020. The Kendall and Spearman correlations were chosen to test the connotation of air quality and climate variables with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 were 65.0 with STD of 37.9 and 87.1 with STD of 52.8 microgram m-3, and 427 with STD of 11.8 ppm, respectively. The average PM2.5 and PM10 drastically reduced up to 62% during COVID-19 lockdown in Dhaka comparing with March 2020 (before lockdown). Comparing with the same period in 2019, PM2.5 reduced up to 33.5%. The average NO2 concentration was 35.0 micromol m-2 during the lockdown period in April, whereas 175.0 micromol m-2 during March (before lockdown). A significant correlation was observed between COVID-19 cases and air quality indicators. A strong correlation was obtained between climate variables and the total number of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality representing a favorable condition for spreading the virus. Our study will be very expedient for policymakers to establish a mechanism for air pollution mitigation based on scientific substantiation, and also will be an essential reference for the advance research to improve urban air quality and the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the tropical nations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Riad Sarkar Pavel","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Abdus Salam","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Mahbuba Yesmin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Enam Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nazmul Ahsan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Shahid Uz Zaman","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Farah Jeba","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Zeyao Zhao","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel T Leung","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

Access to contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in the time of a global crisis because it is associated with health benefits. It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA). Method: The first secondary dataset on coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 6,829 respondents. Data was analysed using chi-square and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Over one-quarter of South Africans could not access contraception and more than every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public or government hospital as source of contraception. Female South Africans (OR=0.89 CI:0.7487-1.0719) and those aged 65 years above (OR=0.67 CI:0.4485-0.9988) were 33% and 11% respectively less likely to have access to contraception. The preferred sources of contraception were associated with the selected demographic and economic variables at P<0.05. Conclusions: Findings from the study suggests strategies and interventions that will be tailored towards non-obstruction of contraception access during the on-going COVID-19 or any future pandemic. Moreover, special consideration should be given to certain provinces and those in 3rd quintile of wealth income.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Obasanjo Afolabi Bolarinwa","author_inst":"University of Kwazulu-Natal, Durban"},{"author_name":"Abdus Salam","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Mahbuba Yesmin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Enam Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nazmul Ahsan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Shahid Uz Zaman","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Farah Jeba","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Zeyao Zhao","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel T Leung","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

This is often not true for diagnostic tests, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Here, we develop Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for Imperfect Tests (LQAS-IMP) to address this issue and apply it to a COVID-19 serosurveillance study in Haiti. Development: As part of the standard LQAS procedure, the user specifies allowable classification errors for the system, which is defined by a sample size and decision rule. We show that when an imperfect diagnostic test is used, the classification errors are larger than specified. We derive a modified procedure, LQAS-IMP, that accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test to yield correct classification errors. Application: At Zanmi Lasante health facilities in Haiti, the goal was to assess the prior circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) using a limited number of antibody tests. As the COVID-19 antibody tests were known to have imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we used the LQAS-IMP procedure to define valid systems for sampling at eleven hospitals in Haiti. Conclusions: The LQAS-IMP procedure accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity in system design; if the accuracy of a test is known, the use of LQAS-IMP extends LQAS to applications for indicators that are based on laboratory tests, such as COVID-19 antibodies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel R Fulcher","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mary Clisbee","author_inst":"Zanmi Lasante"},{"author_name":"Wesler Lambert","author_inst":"Zanmi Lasante"},{"author_name":"Fernet Renand Leandre","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bethany Hedt-Gauthier","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Farah Jeba","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Zeyao Zhao","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel T Leung","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

Studies have suggested promising outcomes using monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1{beta} (Anakinra) or IL6 (Tocilizumab), however no head to head comparison was done between the two treatments. Herein, we report our experience in treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm with either subcutaneous Anakinra given concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or intravenous Tocilizumab. Methods: Comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our hospital between March and May 2020 were collected. Patients who received either Anakinra\/ IVIG or Tocilizumab were selected. Baseline characteristics including oxygen therapy, respiratory status evaluation using ROX index, clinical assessment using NEWS score and laboratory data were collected. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, ICU admission and length of stay. In addition, we compared the change in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers at days 7 and 14 post initiation of therapy. Results: 84 consecutive patients who received either treatment (51 in the Anakinra\/ IVIG group and 33 in the Tocilizumab group) were retrospectively studied. Baseline inflammatory markers were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference regarding to death (21.6% vs 15.2%, p 0.464), intubation (15.7% vs 24.2%, p 0.329), ICU need (57.1% vs 48.5%, p 0.475) or length of stay (13+9.6 vs 14.9+11.6, p 0.512) in the Anakinra\/IVIG and Tocilizumab, respectively. Additionally, the rate of improvement in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers was similar in both groups at days 7 and 14. Furthermore, there was no difference in the incidence of superinfection in both groups. Conclusion: Treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm features with either subcutaneous Anakinra\/IVIG or intravenous Tocilizumab is associated with improved clinical outcomes in most subjects. The choice of treatment does not appear to affect morbidity or mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our study findings.

The aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of drugs used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Method. We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization), virological clearance, and severe adverse events. Results. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Ten articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. Conclusions. Dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. Significance of results. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries; since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.
