We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to detect and isolate new infections rapidly to block transmission that would otherwise occur both on and off campus. The models allow for specification of aspects including scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, test sensitivity that can depend on the time since infection, imported infections from off campus throughout the school term, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks. A web app that implements model calculations is available to facilitate exploration and consideration of a variety of scenarios.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph T.

Here we analyze 247 full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two nearby communities in Wisconsin, USA, and find surprisingly distinct patterns of viral spread. Dane County had the 12th known introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, but this did not lead to descendant community spread. Instead, the Dane County outbreak was seeded by multiple later introductions, followed by limited community spread. In contrast, relatively few introductions in Milwaukee County led to extensive community spread. We present evidence for reduced viral spread in both counties, and limited viral transmission between counties, following the statewide Safer-at-Home public health order, which went into effect 25 March 2020. Our results suggest that early containment efforts suppressed the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within Wisconsin.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gage Kahl Moreno","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin - Madison"},{"author_name":"Katarina M Braun","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Kasen K Riemersma","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Michael A Martin","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter J Halfmann","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Chelsea M Crooks","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Trent Prall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David Baker","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"John J Baczenas","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Anna S Heffron","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Mitchell Ramuta","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Manjeet Khubbar","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Andrea  M.

This study systematically examines care-home outbreaks of COVID-19 in a large Scottish health board. Methods: Analysis of testing, cases and deaths using linked care-home, testing and mortality data for 189 care-homes with 5843 beds in a large Scottish Health Board up to 15\/06\/20. Findings: 70 (37.0%) of care-homes experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, 66 of which were in care-homes for older people where care-home size was strongly associated with outbreaks (OR per 20-bed increase 3.50, 95%CI 2.06 to 5.94). There were 852 confirmed cases and 419 COVID-related deaths, 401 (95.7%) of which occurred in care-homes with an outbreak, 16 (3.8%) in hospital, and two in the 119 care-homes without a known outbreak. For non-COVID related deaths, there were 73 excess deaths in care-homes with an outbreak, but no excess deaths in care-homes without an outbreak, and 24 fewer deaths than expected of care-home residents in hospital. A quarter of COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred in five (2.6%) care-homes, and half in 13 (6.9%) care-homes. Interpretation: The large impact on excess deaths appears to be primarily a direct effect of COVID-19, with cases and deaths are concentrated in a minority of care homes. A key implication is that there is a large pool of susceptible residents if community COVID-19 incidence increases again. Shielding residents from potential sources of infection and rapid action into minimise outbreak size where infection is introduced will be critical in any wave 2. Funding: Not externally funded.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer K Burton","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Gwen Bayne","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Christine Evans","author_inst":"NHS Lothiann"},{"author_name":"Frederike Garbe","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Dermot Gorman","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Naomi Honhold","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Duncan McCormick","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Richard Othieno","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Janet Stevenson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Swietlik","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Mette Tranter","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Lorna Willocks","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"William M Rehrauer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Nasia Safdar","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Caitlin S Pepperell","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20149146","rel_title":"Recurrent Neural Reinforcement Learning for Counterfactual Evaluation of Public Health Interventions on the Spread of Covid-19 in the world","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20149146","rel_abs":"As the Covid-19 pandemic soars around the world, there is urgent need to forecast the expected number of cases worldwide and the length of the pandemic before receding and implement public health interventions for significantly stopping the spread of Covid-19. Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission of epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. Alternative to the epidemiological models, the reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference emerge as a powerful tool to select optimal interventions for worldwide containment of Covid-19. Therefore, we formulated real-time forecasting and evaluation of multiple public health intervention problems into off-policy evaluation (OPE) and counterfactual outcome forecasting problems and integrated RL and recurrent neural network (RNN) for exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, given the historical data that may have been generated by different public health intervention policies. We applied the developed methods to real data collected from January 22, 2020 to July 30, 2020 for real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world. We observed that the number of new cases of Covid-19 worldwide reached a peak (407,205) on July 24, 2020 and forecasted that the number of laboratory-confirmed cumulative cases of Covid-19 will pass 20 million as of August 22, 2020.

One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleix Bassolas","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Sandro Sousa","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Nicosia","author_inst":"Queen mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Shudi Li","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Momiao Xiong","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Richard Othieno","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Janet Stevenson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Swietlik","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Mette Tranter","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Lorna Willocks","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"William M Rehrauer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Nasia Safdar","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Caitlin S Pepperell","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148965","rel_title":"A case-control and cohort study to determine the relationship between ethnic background and severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148965","rel_abs":"Background. People of minority ethnic background may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19 for reasons that are unclear. We sought to examine the relationship between ethnic background and (1) hospital admission for severe COVID-19; (2) in-hospital mortality. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of 872 inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) and 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people resident in the same region. To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Results. The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed\/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed\/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30- 3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed\/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 0.84 [0.63-1.11]) or Mixed\/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.43-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 1.54 [0.98-2.41]). Conclusions. Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Mark Ashworth","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Daniel M Bean","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Hiten Dodhia","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Stevo Durbaba","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Claire Palmer","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Aitken","author_inst":"Lewisham & Greenwich NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard D Barker","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sam Norton","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Martin C Gulliford","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Galloway","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Richard J Dobson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148916","rel_title":"Adolescents' health literacy, health protective measures, and health-related quality of life during the Covid-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148916","rel_abs":"Purpose: First, to describe adolescents' health information sources and knowledge, health literacy (HL), health protective measures, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway. Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. Conclusion: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsti Riiser","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Solvi Helseth","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kristin Haraldstad","author_inst":"University of Agder"},{"author_name":"Astrid Torbjornsen","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kare Ronn Richardsen","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Stevo Durbaba","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Claire Palmer","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Aitken","author_inst":"Lewisham & Greenwich NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard D Barker","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sam Norton","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Martin C Gulliford","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Galloway","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Richard J Dobson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.196618","rel_title":"A Strategy to Treat COVID-19 Disease with Targeted Delivery of Inhalable Liposomal Hydroxychloroquine: A Non-clinical Pharmacokinetic Study","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.196618","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment. In addition to providing critical data informing inactivation methods and risk assessments for diagnostic and research laboratories working with SARS-CoV-2, these data provide a framework for other laboratories to validate their inactivation processes and to guide similar studies for other pathogens.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Welch","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Katherine Davies","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Hubert Buczkowski","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nipunadi Hettiarachchi","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nicole Green","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Arnold","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Jones","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Hannah","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Reah Evans","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Christopher Burton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jane E Burton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Guiver","author_inst":"Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Patricia A Cane","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Neil Woodford","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Christine B Bruce","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Allen D.G Roberts","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Marian J Killip","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.196337","rel_title":"Discovery of clinically approved drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection using a phenotypic screening strategy and network-analysis to predict their potential to treat covid-19","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.196337","rel_abs":"The disease caused by SARS-CoV2, covid-19, rapidly spreads worldwide, causing the greatest threat to global public health in the last 100 years. This scenario has become catastrophic as there are no approved vaccines to prevent the disease, and the main measures to contain the virus transmission are confinement and social distancing. One priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate, neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract, respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19, chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drug-host molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication, inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis. In summary, the present manuscript identified four drugs with active inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection, and by network analysis, we provided new insights and starting points for the clinical evaluation and repurposing process to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nSummary sentenceDiscovery of drug repurposing candidates, inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, using a phenotypic screening strategy and network analysis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Douglas Ferreira Sales-Medina","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ludmila Rodrigues Pinto Ferreira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Lavinia M.

This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be [~]2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4. Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of [~]6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary screen we found [~]50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 [&le;] 50 M. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3\/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 M), Ciluprevir (20.77M). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10M), and Telaprevir (15.25M). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3\/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy D Baker","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rikki L Uhrich","author_inst":"VA Puget Sound Health Care System"},{"author_name":"Gerald C Kraemer","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson High School"},{"author_name":"Jason E Love","author_inst":"Western Washington Pathology"},{"author_name":"Brian C Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Washington\/ VA Puget Sound"},{"author_name":"Gilles Courtemanche","author_inst":"Bioaster"},{"author_name":"Marcos S.

With the number of cases growing, the surface of a salmon chopping board in the market was examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and a positive reaction was observed. Following these test results, there has been debate over whether salmon can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. To find assess this, we investigated the structural homology of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, between humans and other species including salmon and mink. As a result, a high structural homology between ACE2 and mink, which has reportedly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans, was confirmed.

Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma S Winkler","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Adam L Bailey","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Natasha M Kafai","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Sharmila Nair","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Broc T McCune","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jinsheng Yu","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"James T Earnest","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Shamus P Keeler","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jon H Ritter","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Liang-I Kang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Sarah Dort","author_inst":"SCIREQ Scientific Respiratory Equipment Inc"},{"author_name":"Annette Robichaud","author_inst":"SCIREQ Scientific Respiratory Equipment Inc"},{"author_name":"Richard Head","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael J Holtzman","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.194027","rel_title":"Severely ill COVID-19 patients display augmented functional properties in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.194027","rel_abs":"The molecular properties of CD8+ T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully known.

While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection. Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARS-CoV-2.

We show that pDC are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed checkpoint molecules at levels similar to influenza virus-induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-, interferon-{lambda}1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. Importantly, all major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, including P2- and P3-pDC differentiation, the expression of maturation markers, and the production of interferon- and inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that pDC may represent a major player in the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and call for caution in the use of hydroxychloroquine in the early treatment of the disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fanny Onodi","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Lucie Bonnet-Madin","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"L\u00e9a Karpf","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Laurent Meertens","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Justine Poirot","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Jer\u00f4me LeGoff","author_inst":"Paris Diderot University and APHP - H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis"},{"author_name":"Constance Delaugerre","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Ali AMARA","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Vassili Soumelis","author_inst":"INSERM U976"},{"author_name":"Meena S.

To address this, we applied single-cell profiling to bronchoalveolar lavages from 44 patients with mild or critical COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia as control. Viral RNA-tracking delineated the infection phenotype to epithelial cells, but positioned mainly neutrophils at the forefront of viral clearance activity during COVID-19. In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically  controlled fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by  orderly phagocytic disposal of dead\/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity. Our work represents a major resource for understanding the lung-localised immunity and inflammation landscape during COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Els Wauters","author_inst":"Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and Thoracic Surgery (BREATHE), Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre Van Mol","author_inst":"VIB Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Translational Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium;"},{"author_name":"Abhishek D.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini, we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, complete secondary structure of SAR-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on mechanisms of replication, translation and packaging, and guide the identification of new RNA drug targets against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas C Huston","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Han Wan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Rafael de Cesaris Araujo Tavares","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Je Hyoung Kim","author_inst":"Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kijong Yi","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Su Yeon Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kwon Joong Na","author_inst":"Seoul National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bleazard","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Ho Min Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Natasha Ivory","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Krishnaa T.

To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the proteins stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation. Highly stable and well producing S protein and the increased understanding of S protein structure will support vaccine development and serological diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jarek Juraszek","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lucy Rutten","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sven Blokland","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Pascale Bouchier","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Richard Voorzaat","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tina Ritschel","author_inst":"Janssen Vaccines & Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mark J.G.

Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6,324 viral genome sequences, we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus.

However, in human populations, especially under different levels of quarantine conditions, this assumption is likely to fail. We develop a continuous spatial model that includes five different populations, in which the infectious population is split into latent (or pre-symptomatic) and symptomatic. Based on nearest-neighbor infection kinetics, we arrive into a ``reaction-diffusion'' model. Our model accounts for front propagation of the infectious population domains under partial quarantine conditions, which is present on top of the common local infection process. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. Our results demonstrate how infected domains spread outward from epicenters\/hotspots, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (quasi linear or power-law) growth. Moreover, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the center of the populated area. Predicted heat-maps show remarkable similarity to recently media released heat-maps. We further demonstrate how localized strong quarantine conditions can prevent the spreading of the disease from an epicenter\/hotspot, significantly reducing the number of infected people. Application of our model in different countries, using actual demographic data and infectious disease parameters, can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areas.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoav Tsori","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Rony Granek","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Thin Nguyen","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Henry Nguyen","author_inst":"Griffith University"},{"author_name":"Asim Bhatti","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Dinh C.

By analysing data that are collected about the current COVID-19 outbreak onboard, and by considering the design of the air conditioning system of the ship and virus transmission modes on cruise ships, this study aims to raise the hypothesis regarding the role of poor ventilation systems in the spread of COVID-19. Design: This is an analysis of count data that has been collected by the onboard clinic up to the 20th February 2020. Symptomatic infection rates during the quarantine period in cabins with previous confirmed cases are compared to these in cabins without previous confirmed cases. Results: Symptomatic infection rate during the quarantine period in cabins with previously confirmed cases is not significantly higher than that in cabins without previously confirmed cases. Age does not appear to be a cofounder. Conclusions: Airborne transmission of COVID-19 through the ventilation system onboard could explain the virus spread into cabins during the quarantine period.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Orouba Almilaji","author_inst":"Bournemouth University"},{"author_name":"Peter Thomas","author_inst":"Bournemouth University"},{"author_name":"Fawatim Al-Nahwi","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Heba Al-Ameer","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Sameer Al-Abdi","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Al-Ahsa, Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Dinh C.

KN95 respirators and N95 decontamination protocols have been described as solutions to a lack of such PPE. However, there are a few materials science studies that characterize the charge distribution and physical changes accompanying disinfection treatments particularly heating. Here, we report the filtration efficiency, dipole charge density, and fiber integrity of pristine N95 and KN95 respirators before and after various decontamination methods. We found that the filter layer of N95 is 8-fold thicker than that of KN95, which explains its 10% higher filtration efficiency (97.03 %) versus KN95 (87.76 %) under pristines condition. After 60 minutes of 70 {degrees}C treatment, the filtration efficiency and dipole charge density of N95 became 97.16% and 12.48 {micro}C\/m2, while those of KN95 were 83.64% and 1.48 {micro}C\/m2 ; moreover, fit factor of N95 was 55 and that of KN95 was 2.7. In conclusion, the KN95 respirator is an inferior alternative of N95 respirator. In both systems, a loss of electrostatic charge does not directly correlate to a decrease in performance.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wonjun Yim","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Diyi Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Shiv Patel","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Rui Kui","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Ying Shirley Meng","author_inst":"University of California Sandiego"},{"author_name":"Jesse V.

Methods Based on systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct up to April 22, 2020, a total of 52 eligible articles with 6,320 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cohorts were included. Pairwise comparison between severe versus mild disease, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus general ward admission, and expired versus survivors were performed for 36 laboratory parameters. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird method\/random effects model and converted to Odds ratio (OR). The decision tree algorithm was employed to identify the key risk factor(s) attributed to severe COVID-19 disease. Results Cohorts with elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs) (OR=1.75), neutrophil count (OR=2.62), D-dimer (OR=3.97), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR=1.82), fibrinogen (OR=3.14), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR=1.60), procalcitonin (OR=4.76), IL-6 (OR=2.10), and IL-10 (OR=4.93) had higher odds of progression to severe phenotype. Decision tree model (sensitivity=100%, specificity=81%) showed the high performance of neutrophil count at a cut-off value of more than 3.74 x109\/L for identifying patients at high risk of severe COVID-19. Likewise, ICU admission was associated with higher levels of WBCs (OR=5.21), neutrophils (OR=6.25), D-dimer (OR=4.19), and prolonged PT (OR=2.18). Patients with high IL-6 (OR=13.87), CRP (OR=7.09), D-dimer (OR=6.36), and neutrophils (OR=6.25) had the highest likelihood of mortality. Conclusions Several hematological and immunological markers, in particular neutrophilic count, could be helpful to be included within the routine panel for COVID-19 infection evaluation to ensure risk stratification and effective management.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rami M Elshazli","author_inst":"Horus University - Egypt"},{"author_name":"Eman Ali Toraih","author_inst":"Tulane Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Abdelaziz Elgaml","author_inst":"Mansoura University and Horus University - Egypt"},{"author_name":"Mohammed El-Mowafy","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed El-Mesery","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed N Amin","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad H Hussein","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Mary T Killackey","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Manal S Fawzy","author_inst":"Suez Canal University"},{"author_name":"Emad Kandil","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Ho Min Kim","author_inst":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Natasha Ivory","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Krishnaa T.

Early identification of risk factors and clinical outcomes might help to identify critically ill patients, provide proper treatment and prevent mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in patients with flu-like symptoms referred to the imaging department of a tertiary hospital in IRAN between 3 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients with COVID-19 were followed up to check their health condition after two months. The categorical data between groups were analyzed by Fisher exact test and continuous data by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Findings: 319 patients (mean age 45.48 years, 177 women) were enrolled. Fever, dyspnea, weakness, shivering, C-reactive protein (CRP), fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, sweating and age were the most important symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Traveling in past three months, asthma, taking corticosteroids, liver disease, rheumatological disease, cough with sputum, eczema, conjunctivitis, tobacco use, and chest pain did not have any relationship with COVID-19. Interpretation: Finding clinical symptoms for early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical part of prevention. These symptoms can help in the assessment of disease progression.
