A reasonable policy will surely prioritize populations facing high risk of severe illness in high-exposure occupations. The challenge is deciding between high-risk populations in low-exposure occupations and those that are young and healthy but work in high-exposure occupations. We estimate occupation-based infection risks and use age-based infection fatality rates in a model to assign priorities over populations with different occupations and ages. Among others, we find that 50 year-old food-processing workers and 60 year-old financial advisors are equally prioritized. Our model suggests a vaccine distribution that emphasizes age-based mortality risk more than occupation-based exposure risk. Designating some occupations as essential does not affect the optimal vaccine allocation, unless a stay-at-home order is also in effect. Even with vaccines allocated optimally, 1.37% of the employed workforce is still expected to be infected with the virus until the vaccine becomes widely available, provided the vaccine is 50% effective and assuming a supply of 60mil doses.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Babus","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Sanmay Das","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"SangMok Lee","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20160028","rel_title":"Evidence for immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from epidemiological data series","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20160028","rel_abs":"The duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Delineating immune memory typically requires longitudinal serological studies that track antibody prevalence in the same cohort for an extended time. However, this information is needed in faster timescales. Notably, the dynamics of an epidemic where recovered patients become immune for any period should differ significantly from those of one where the recovered promptly become susceptible. Here, we exploit this difference to provide a reliable protocol that can estimate immunity early in an epidemic. We verify this protocol with synthetic data, discuss its limitations, and then apply it to evaluate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mortality data series from New York City. Our results indicate that New York's mortality figures are incompatible with immunity lasting anything below 105 or above 211 days (90% CI.), and set an example on how to assess immune memory in emerging pandemics before serological studies can be deployed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pablo Yubero","author_inst":"Spanish National Biotechnology Center (CNB-CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Alvar A.

We sought to assess the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and serious complications in current users of ARB or ACEi compared to users of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (dhpCCB). Design: Cohort study Setting: The analysis used de-identified, patient-level data from HealthVerity, linking longitudinal data from US medical and pharmacy claims, which contain information on inpatient or outpatient diagnoses, procedures and medication dispensing. Participants: We identified patients aged 40+ and free of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were newly diagnosed COVID-19, between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020, and adherent to ACEi, ARB, or dhpCCB therapy. Interventions: Current use of an ACEi, ARB, or dhpCCB. Main outcome measures: We compared the 30-day risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and serious complications. Results: Of 24,708 patients identified, 7,571 were current users of an ARB, 8,484 of an ACEi, and 8,653 of a dhpCCB. The unadjusted 30-day risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 2.66% among ARB users, and 2.90% among ACEi users and 3.68% in dhpCCB users. In the PS-matched cohort, the risk of hospitalization among ARB users was 17% lower as compared to dhpCCB (RR=0.83; 0.68-1.00), and the risk among ACE users was 10% lower as compared to dhpCCB (RR=0.90; 0.76-1.07). When including patients with pre-existing CKD, the protective effect of ARB (RR= 0.74; 0.62-0.88) and ACEi (RR=0.84; 0.71-0.99) was more pronounced. Conclusions: This cohort study showed that neither ARB nor ACEi use increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease among those infected, and instead suggests that current use of ARB may offer a protective effect. This study found no evidence to support the discontinuation of ARB\/ACEi therapy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria C Schneeweiss","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandra Leonard","author_inst":"HealthVerity Inc."},{"author_name":"Andrew Weckstein","author_inst":"Aetion, Inc."},{"author_name":"Sebastian Schneeweiss","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Rassen","author_inst":"Aetion, Inc."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20160226","rel_title":"Pediatric intensive care unit admissions for COVID-19: insights using state level data","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20160226","rel_abs":"Introduction Intensive care has played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic as many patients developed severe pulmonary complications. The availability of information in pediatric intensive care (PICUs) remains limited. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 positive admissions (CPAs) in the United States and to determine factors that may impact those admissions. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 dashboard virtual pediatric system containing information regarding respiratory support and comorbidities for all CPAs between March and April 2020. The state level data contained 13 different factors from population density, comorbid conditions and social distancing score. The absolute CPAs count was converted to frequency using the state's population. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CPAs frequency and endpoints. Results A total of 205 CPAs were reported by 167 PICUs across 48 states. The estimated CPAs frequency was 2.8 per million children. A total of 3,235 tests were conducted with 6.3% positive tests. Children above 11 years of age comprised 69.7% of the total cohort and 35.1% had moderated or severe comorbidities. The median duration of a CPA was 4.9 days [1.25-12.00 days]. Out of the 1,132 total CPA days, 592 [52.2%] were for mechanical ventilation. The inpatient mortalities were 3 [1.4%]. Multivariate analyses demonstrated an association between CPA's with greater population density [beta-coefficient 0.01, p<0.01] and increased percent of children receiving the influenza vaccination [beta-coefficient 0.17, p=0.01]. Conclusions Inpatient mortality during PICU CPAs is relatively low at 1.4%. CPA frequency seems to be impacted by population density while characteristics of illness severity appear to be associated with ultraviolet index, temperature, and comorbidities such as Type 1 diabetes. These factors should be included in future studies using patient-level data.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohit S.

Houston, located in the Harris County of Texas, is becoming the next hotspot of this pandemic. With a severe decline in international and inter-state travel, a model at the county level, as opposed to the state or country level, is needed. Existing approaches have a few drawbacks. Firstly, the data used is the number of COVID-19 positive cases instead of positivity. The former is a function of the number of tests carried out while the latter is normalized by the number of tests. Positivity gives a better picture of the spread of this pandemic as with time more tests are being administered. Positivity under 5% has been desired for the reopening of businesses to almost 100% capacity. Secondly, the data used by models like SEIRD lacks information about the sentiment of people with respect to coronavirus. Thirdly, models that make use of social media posts might have too much noise. News sentiment, on the other hand, can capture long term effects of hidden variables like public policy, opinions of local doctors, and disobedience of state-wide mandates. The present study introduces a new AI model, viz., Sentiment Informed Timeseries Analyzing AI (SITALA), that has been trained on COVID-19 test positivity data and news sentiment from over 2750 news articles for the Harris county. The news sentiment was obtained using IBM Watson Discovery News. SITALA is inspired by Google-Wavenet architecture and makes use of TensorFlow. The mean absolute error for the training dataset of 66 consecutive days is 2.76 and that for the test dataset of 22 consecutive days is 9.6. The model forecasts that in order to curb the spread of coronavirus in Houston, a sustained negative news sentiment will be desirable. Public policymakers may use SITALA to set the tone of the local policies and mandates.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Prathamesh S Desai","author_inst":"W. M.

An agent-based simulation model was adapted and used to project the number of infections and deaths under multiple school reopening dates and scenarios, including different cohorts receiving in-person instruction on alternating days, only younger children returning to in-person instruction, regular schedule (all students receiving in-person instruction), and school closure (all students receiving online instruction). The study period was February 18th-November 24th, 2020 and the state of Georgia was used as a case study. Across all scenarios, the number of COVID19-related deaths ranged from approximately 17 to 22 thousand during the study period, and on the peak day, the number of new infections ranged from 43 to 68 thousand. An alternating school day schedule performed: (i) almost as well as keeping schools closed, with the infection attack rate ranging from 38.5% to 39.8% compared to that of 37.7% under school closure; (ii) slightly better than only allowing children 10 years or younger to return to in-person instruction.

This systematic review aimed to examine contact tracing effectiveness in the context of COVID-19. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and All EBM Reviews were searched using a range of terms related to contact tracing for COVID-19. Articles were included if they reported on the ability of contact tracing to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 or on characteristics of effective tracing efforts. Two investigators screened all studies. Results: A total of 32 articles were found. All were observational or modelling studies, so the quality of the evidence was low. Observational studies (n=14) all reported that contact tracing (alone or in combination with other interventions) was associated with better control of COVID-19. Results of modelling studies (n=18) depended on their assumptions. Under assumptions of prompt and thorough tracing with no further transmission, they found that contact tracing could stop an outbreak (e.g. by reducing the reproduction number from 2.2 to 0.57) or that it could reduce infections (e.g. by 24%-71% with a mobile tracing app). Under assumptions of slower, less efficient tracing, modelling studies suggested that tracing could slow, but not stop COVID-19. Conclusions: Observational and modelling studies suggest that contact tracing is associated with better control of COVID-19. Its effectiveness likely depends on a number of factors, including how many and how fast contacts are traced and quarantined, and how effective quarantines are at preventing further transmission. A cautious interpretation suggests that to stop the spread of COVID-19, public health practitioners have 2-3 days from the time a new case develops symptoms to isolate the case and quarantine at least 80% of its contacts, and that once isolated, cases and contacts should infect zero new cases. Less efficient tracing may slow, but not stop, the spread of COVID-19. Inefficient tracing (with delays of 4-5+ days or less than 60% of contacts quarantined with no further transmission) may not contribute meaningfully to control of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carl-Etienne Juneau","author_inst":"COVID-19 Work Group"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sara Briand","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Tomas Pueyo","author_inst":"COVID-19 Work Group"},{"author_name":"Pablo Collazzo","author_inst":"Danube University"},{"author_name":"Louise Potvin","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20160085","rel_title":"Homebound by COVID19: The Benefits and Consequences of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Strategies","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20160085","rel_abs":"Objectives.

Here, we report safety data from three outpatient randomized clinical trials. Methods: We conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine. We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our findings. Results: We enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR 34-49) years, and 59% (1633\/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324 (84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo.

Patients receiving out-of-week-2-MP, non-pulse glucocorticoids or no glucocorticoids had an increased adjusted risk for both outcomes compared with week-2-MP group: HR 5.04 (95% CI 0.91-27.86), HR 10.09 (95% CI 2.14-47.50), HR 4.14 (95% CI 0.81-21.23), respectively, for death; HR 7.38 (95% CI 1.86-29.29), HR 13.71 (95% CI 3.76-50.07), HR 3.58 (95% CI 0.89-14.32), respectively, for death or intubation. These differences were significant only in the subgroup with low SpO2\/FiO2. CONCLUSIONS: Week-2-MP are effective in improving the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with features of inflammatory activity and respiratory deterioration entering the second week of disease. The recognition of this high-risk population should prompt early use of MP at this point. This study has been registered in the EU PAS Register with the number EUPAS36287.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillermo Ruiz-Irastorza","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jose-Ignacio Pijoan","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elena Bereciartua","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Susanna Dunder","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jokin Dominguez","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Paula Garcia-Escudero","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Rodrigo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlota Gomez-Carballo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jimena Varona","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Guio","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marta Ibarrola","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amaia Ugarte","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Agustin Martinez-Berriotxoa","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Glen Drobot","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Nicole Marten","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Cheng","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Zarychanshi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Ilan S Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Michael Silverman","author_inst":"Lawson Research Institute, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Zain Chagla","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Kelly","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Huppler Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.216242","rel_title":"Phylogeny of the COVID-19 Virus SARS-CoV-2 by Compression","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.216242","rel_abs":"We analyze the whole genome phylogeny and taxonomy of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using compression.

Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1 and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1 or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis, and discerns the effect of therapeutic cytokine blockade in JIA. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1 and IL-6 response modules, but not these cytokines per se, is a feature of disease both in blood and in affected organs. We propose that IL-1 and IL-6 transcriptional response modules can provide a dynamic readout of the activity of these cytokine pathways in vivo, with potential applications for identifying COVID-19 patients who may benefit from IL-1 or IL-6 blocking therapy, and to aid quantification of the biological effects of these treatments.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucy C K Bell","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pollara","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Susanna Dunder","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jokin Dominguez","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Paula Garcia-Escudero","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Rodrigo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlota Gomez-Carballo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jimena Varona","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Guio","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marta Ibarrola","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amaia Ugarte","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Agustin Martinez-Berriotxoa","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Glen Drobot","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Nicole Marten","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Cheng","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Zarychanshi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Ilan S Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Michael Silverman","author_inst":"Lawson Research Institute, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Zain Chagla","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Kelly","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Huppler Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.213959","rel_title":"From people to Panthera: Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.213959","rel_abs":"We describe the first cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection detected in animals in the United States.

Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyse ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. We showed that ACE2 is indeed present in human pancreatic islets, where is preferentially expressed by insulin producing {beta}-cells. Of note, pro-inflammatory cytokines increased ACE2 expression in {beta}-cells, thus putatively suggesting an enhancement of {beta}-cells sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 during inflammatory conditions.

Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and\/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2, and the high economical and health impact of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease.

We show that it binds to Drug Site 7, which is also the binding site for commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and testosterone, suggesting potentially problematic binding competition. This study bridges structural findings with our analysis of publicly available clinical data from Wuhan and suggests that an adjustment of dexamethasone regimen should be considered for patients affected by two major COVID-19 risk-factors: low albumin levels and diabetes.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryStructure of serum albumin with dexamethasone reveals why the drug may not always help COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan G.

The antibody production against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was elevated, with large individual differences, as assessed by ELISA. In the analysis of the predicted the linear B cell epitopes, two regions (671-690 aa. and 1146-1164 aa.), which were located in S1 and S2 but not in the RBD, were highly reactive with the sera from patients. In the further analysis of the B cell epitope within the S protein by utilizing a B cell epitope array, a hot spot in the N-terminal domain of the S protein but not the RBD was observed in individuals with neutralizing activity. Overall, the analysis of antibody production and B cell epitopes of the S protein from patient serum may provide a novel target for the vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shota Yoshida","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chikako Ono","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Hiroki Hayashi","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Shiraishi","author_inst":"Juso Osaka City Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tomono Kazunori","author_inst":"Division of Infection Control and Prevention, Osaka University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hisashi Arase","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yoshiharu Matsuura","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Hironori Nakagami","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wladek Minor","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, 1340 Jefferson Park Avenue, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA"},{"author_name":"Piero Marchetti","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chantal Mathieu","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology (CEE), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KULEUVEN), Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Decio Laks Eizirik","author_inst":"ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guido Sebastiani","author_inst":"Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neurosciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy;

As with other respiratory pathogens, the nasal compartment is the first barrier that needs to be breached by the SARS-CoV-2 virus before dissemination to the lung. Despite progress at remarkable speed, current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. We report the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that contains the trimeric or monomeric spike protein and liposomal STING agonist as adjuvant. This vaccine induces systemic neutralizing antibodies, mucosal IgA responses in the lung and nasal compartments, and T-cell responses in the lung of mice. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirmed the concomitant activation of T and B cell responses in a germinal center-like manner within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT), confirming its role as an inductive site that can lead to long-lasting immunity. The ability to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract has can prevent the initial establishment of infection in individuals and prevent disease transmission across humans.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xingyue An","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Melisa Paniagua Martinez","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Ali Rezvan","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Fathi","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Shailbala Singh","author_inst":"University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sujit Biswas","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pourpak","author_inst":"BD Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Cassian Yee","author_inst":"University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Xinli Liu","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Navin Varadarajan","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Chantal Mathieu","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology (CEE), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KULEUVEN), Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Decio Laks Eizirik","author_inst":"ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guido Sebastiani","author_inst":"Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neurosciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy;

The virus genome analysis during disease spread reveals about its evolution and transmission. We did whole genome sequencing of 225 clinical strains from the state of Odisha in eastern India using ARTIC protocol-based amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe and South-east Asia followed by local transmission. Interestingly, 19B clade was found to be much more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) as compared to other genomes reported so far from India. The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and 19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March and April. We found that with the time 20A and 20B clades evolved drastically that originated from central Europe. At the same time, it has been observed that 20A and 20B clades depicted selection of four common mutations i.e. 241 C>T (5UTR), P323L in RdRP, F942F in NSP3 and D614G in the spike protein. We found an increase in the concordance of G614 mutation evolution with the viral load in clinical samples as evident from decreased Ct value of spike and Orf1ab gene in qPCR. Molecular modelling and docking analysis identified that D614G mutation enhanced interaction of spike with TMPRSS2 protease, which could impact the shedding of S1 domain and infectivity of the virus in host cells.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sunil Raghav","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Arup Ghosh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmayee Turuk","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Sugandh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Atimukta Jha","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Swati Madhulika","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Manasi Priyadarshini","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Viplov K Biswas","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"P.

The effective delivery of eukaryotic expression plasmids to the immune systems inductive cells constitutes an essential requirement for the generation of effective DNA vaccines. Here, we have explored the use of Salmonella typhimurium as vehicles to deliver expression plasmids orally. Attenuated Salmonella phoP harboring eukaryotic expression plasmids that encoded spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was administered orally to Wistar rats. Rats were immunized orally with Salmonella that carried a eukaryotic expression plasmid once a week for three consecutive weeks. The efficiency of the vaccination procedure was due to the transfer of the expression plasmid from the bacterial carrier to the mammalian host. Evidence for such an event could be obtained in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that all immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, indicating that a Salmonella-based vaccine carrying the Spike gene can elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses in rats, and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dezhi Yang","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia International Mongolian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhu","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia

COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.23.217372","rel_abs":"Filter facepiece respirators (FFRs) are critical for preventing the transmission of respiratory tract infection disease, especially the dreadful coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2). The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 m. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex(R) test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new N99 respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of N99 over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators.. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thananda Trakarnvanich","author_inst":"Department of Medicine,Vajira hospital"},{"author_name":"Anan Manomaipiboon","author_inst":"Navamindradhiraj University"},{"author_name":"Sujaree Pupipatpab","author_inst":"Navamindradhiraj University"},{"author_name":"Pongsathorn Chomdee Chomdee","author_inst":"Navamindradhiraj University"},{"author_name":"Pathiporn Boonyapatkul","author_inst":"Navamindradhiraj University"},{"author_name":"Tegexi Baiyin","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia International Mongolian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Temuqile Temuqile","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia International Mongolian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shana Chen","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia International Mongolian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Siqin Borjigen","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia International Mongolian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huricha Baigude","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia University"},{"author_name":"Neha Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Deepika Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Avula Kiran","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Shuchi Smita","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotsnamayee Sabat","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Debdutta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rupesh Dash","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Shantibhushan Senapati","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Tushar K Beuria","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rajeeb Swain","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Soma Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Gulam Hussain Syed","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Anshuman Dixit","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Punit Prasad","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Ajay Parida","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Colleen McCann","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Thomas","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Erin Goodrich","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"},{"author_name":"Francois Elvinger","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"},{"author_name":"David C Smith","author_inst":"New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, Albany, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Suxiang Wang","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA."},{"author_name":"Sally Slavinski","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Queens, NY, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul P Calle","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Karen Terio","author_inst":"Zoological Pathology Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Mia Kim Torchetti","author_inst":"National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Veterinary Services, United States Department of Agriculture, Ames, Iowa, USA"},{"author_name":"Diego G Diel","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"scientific communication and education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.23.217331","rel_title":"Development and validation of a clinical risk score to predict the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from administrative data: a population-based cohort study from Italy","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.23.217331","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly worldwide increasing exponentially in Italy. To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the population most at risk of infection. Hence, we aimed to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk comparing it with unspecific surrogates.\n\nMethodsRetrospective case\/control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each subject with Covid-19 confirmed diagnosis (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS), was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. SIS was validated by comparison with specific and unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nResultsSubjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinsons disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS=4), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS=1).\n\nConclusionThis study identified conditions and diseases making individuals more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results are a decision-maker support tool for identifying population most at risk allowing adoption of preventive measures to minimize a potential new relapse damage.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valentina Orlando","author_inst":"CIRFF Center of Drug utilization and Pharmacoeconomics"},{"author_name":"Federico

To examine the spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we present regional estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in the country. Methods: Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers of the COVID-19 in Korea and its doubling time, respectively. Results: At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province have experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by the second wave in early June, with Rt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu are yet to experience a second wave of the disease, where the mean Rt reached 3.5-4.4 and doubling time ranging from 2.8 to 4.6 days during the first wave. Conclusions: Our findings support the effectiveness of control measures against COVID-19 in Korea. However, the easing of the restrictions imposed by the government in May 2020 facilitated a second wave in the greater Seoul area.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eunha Shim","author_inst":"Soongsil University"},{"author_name":"Amna Tariq","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Stephen Lorenz","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark Wylie","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Zhang","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lopiccolo","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lloyd Clarke","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeanhee Chung","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Corrao","author_inst":"Laboratory of Healtcare Research and Pharmacoepidemiology, Unit of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Neha Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Deepika Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Avula Kiran","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Shuchi Smita","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotsnamayee Sabat","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Debdutta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rupesh Dash","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Shantibhushan Senapati","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Tushar K Beuria","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rajeeb Swain","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Soma Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Gulam Hussain Syed","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Anshuman Dixit","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Punit Prasad","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Ajay Parida","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Colleen McCann","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Thomas","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Erin Goodrich","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"},{"author_name":"Francois Elvinger","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"},{"author_name":"David C Smith","author_inst":"New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, Albany, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Suxiang Wang","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA."},{"author_name":"Sally Slavinski","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Queens, NY, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul P Calle","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Karen Terio","author_inst":"Zoological Pathology Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Mia Kim Torchetti","author_inst":"National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Veterinary Services, United States Department of Agriculture, Ames, Iowa, USA"},{"author_name":"Diego G Diel","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20158527","rel_title":"COVID-19 Cases Projection in Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-07-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20158527","rel_abs":"In this projection exercise, we analyzed the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh and used multiple methods to characterize the epidemic curve.

This is true, both in terms of incidence of cases (total number of cases per million population) and length of the epidemic (months to peak or flatten the epidemic curve). We find that while Bangladesh went into lockdown early, efforts to maintain lockdown at a national level was relaxed and new cases accelerated; with significant growth happening since lifting of lockdown on May 31.

respiratory infection, initially reported in China, known as COVID-19 initially reported in China, and later known as COVID-19, led to a global pandemic. Despite many studies reporting respiratory infections as the primary manifestations of this illness, an increasing number of investigations have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations in COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CNS presentations in COVID-19 patients in an attempt to identify the common CNS features and provide a better overview to tackle this new pandemic. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Included studies were publications that reported the CNS features between January 1st, 2020, to April 20th, 2020. The data of selected studies were screened and extracted independently by four reviewers. Extracted data analyzed by using STATA statistical software. The study protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020184456). Results: Of 2353 retrieved studies, we selected 64 studies with 11282 patients after screening. Most of the studies were conducted in China (58 studies). The most common CNS symptom of COVID-19 were Headache (8.69%, 95%CI: 6.76%-10.82%), Dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%-8.22%), and Impaired consciousness (1.9%, 95%CI: 1%-2.79%). Conclusions: The growing number of studies have reported COVID-19, CNS presentations as remarkable manifestations that happen. Hence, understanding the CNS characteristics of COVID-19 can help us for better diagnosis and ultimately prevention of worse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shahrzad

impacted the world significantly. Modeling the trend of infection and real-time forecasting of cases can help decision making and control of the disease spread. However, data-driven methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) can perform poorly due to limited daily samples in time. In this work, we develop an integrated spatiotemporal model based on the epidemic differential equations (SIR) and RNN. The former after simplification and discretization is a compact model of temporal infection trend of a region while the latter models the effect of nearest neighboring regions. The latter captures latent spatial information. We trained and tested our model on COVID-19 data in Italy, and show that it out-performs existing temporal models (fully connected NN, SIR, ARIMA) in 1-day, 3-day, and 1-week ahead forecasting especially in the regime of limited training data.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhijian Li","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Yunling

respiratory tract and gut. Whether regional microbiomes are disturbed significantly to affect the disease progression of COVID-19 is largely unknown. To address this question, we performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of throat and anal swabs from 35 COVID-19 adults and 15 controls by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results allowed a partitioning of patients into 3-4 categories (I-IV) with distinct microbial community types in both sites. Lower-diversity community types often appeared in the early phase of COVID-19, and synchronous fast restoration of both the respiratory and gut microbiomes from early dysbiosis towards late near-normal was observed in 6\/8 mild COVID-19 adult patients despite they had a relatively slow clinical recovery. The synchronous shift of the community types was associated with significantly positive bacterial interactions between the respiratory tract and gut, possibly along the airway-gut axis. These findings reveal previously unknown interactions between respiratory and gut microbiomes, and suggest that modulations of regional microbiota might help to improve the recovery from COVID-19 in adult patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rong Xu","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Renfei Lu","author_inst":"Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Qunfu Wu","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Weihua Cai","author_inst":"Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Xudong Han","author_inst":"Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Xia Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Chiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhou Wan","author_inst":"Medical Laboratory of Taizhou Fourth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sahar Dalvand","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Deepika Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Avula Kiran","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Shuchi Smita","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotsnamayee Sabat","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Debdutta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rupesh Dash","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Shantibhushan Senapati","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Tushar K Beuria","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rajeeb Swain","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Soma Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Gulam Hussain Syed","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Anshuman Dixit","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Punit Prasad","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Ajay Parida","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Colleen McCann","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Thomas","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Erin Goodrich","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"},{"author_name":"Francois Elvinger","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"},{"author_name":"David C Smith","author_inst":"New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, Albany, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Suxiang Wang","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA."},{"author_name":"Sally Slavinski","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Queens, NY, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul P Calle","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Karen Terio","author_inst":"Zoological Pathology Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Illinois, USA"},{"author_name":"Mia Kim Torchetti","author_inst":"National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Veterinary Services, United States Department of Agriculture, Ames, Iowa, USA"},{"author_name":"Diego G Diel","author_inst":"Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
