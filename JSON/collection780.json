The aim of this study was to identify patients who were likely to test positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 during hospitalization by comparing COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were [&ge;]18 years old and underwent COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction test because they presented with symptoms thought to be due to COVID-19. The Poisson regression analysis was conducted after clinical presentation, demographic, medical co-morbidities, laboratory and chest image data was retrieved from the medical records. Results: Charts of 277 and 35 COVID-19 negative and positive patients respectively were analyzed. Dyspnea (61%) was the most common symptom among COVID-19 negative patients, while 83% and 77% COVID-19 positive patients had cough and fever respectively. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present initially with cough [1.082 (1.022 - 1.145)] and fever [1.066 (1.013 - 1.122)], besides being males [1.066 (1.013 - 1.123)] and 50 to 69 years old [1.090 (1.019 - 1.166)]. Dyspnea, weakness, lymphopenia and bilateral chest image abnormality were not associated with COVID-19 positivity. COVID-19 positive patients were less likely to have non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.934 (0.893 - 0.976)], human immunodeficiency virus [0.847 (0.763 - 0.942)] and heart failure history [0.945 (0.908 - 0.984)]. Other chronic medical problems (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease) were not associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Cough and fever are better predictors of symptomatic COVID-19 positivity during hospitalization. Despite published studies reporting a high prevalence of lymphopenia among COVID-19 positive patients, lymphopenia is not associated with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Northwestern HCW SARS-CoV-2 Serology Cohort Study. The Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay was used to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to COVID-19) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, healthcare delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status. Results: 6,510 HCWs, including 1,794 nurses, and 904 non-patient facing administrators participated. The majority were women (79.6%), 74.9% were white, 9.7% were Asian, 7.3% were Hispanic and 3.1% were Black. The crude prevalence rate of seropositivity was 4.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6%-5.2%). Out-of-hospital exposure to COVID-19 occurred in 9.3% of HCWs and was strongly associated with seropositivity (OR=4.7, 95% CI: 3.5-6.4). When compared to administrators, nursing was the only occupation group with a significantly higher adjusted-odds (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9) of seropositivity. Exposure to COVID-19 patients was reported by 37.8% of participants and was associated with higher positivity than those not exposed (OR= 2.2, 95% CI: 1.6-3.0). Being exposed to patients receiving high-flow oxygen therapy, and hemodialysis also remained significantly associated with a 45% and 57% higher odds for seropositive status, respectively. Conclusions: Exposure to COVID-19 patients, and longer duration patient therapies were each associated with higher risk for seropositive status; however, the community burden of COVID-19 remains a significant source of exposure to SARS CoV-2 infection among HCWs in Chicago.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Wilkins","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Lucia Gray","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amisha Wallia","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hirschhorn","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Teresa Zembower","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joyce Ho","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naomi Kalume","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ojoma Agbo","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Zhu","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Laura Rasmussen-Torvic","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sadiya Khan","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Carnethon","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Huffman","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlesnika Evans","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20191445","rel_title":"RAAS blockers and region-specific variations in COVID-19 outcomes: findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-09-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20191445","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved as a global crisis with high mortality seen in elderly and people with cardiometabolic diseases. The use of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers in these patients is known to enhance the expression of ACE-2, the chief binding receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and may potentially enhance infectivity. Objective: To provide a pooled estimate of the effect of RAAS blocker usage on COVID-19 outcomes. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE\/PubMed and Google Scholar) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest. The last search was conducted on 9th July 2020. Study Selection: Studies reporting data on RAAS blocker use and COVID-19 mortality and severity were included in the review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Mortality data and severity data including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, steroid use and acute kidney injury (AKI) were recorded. Pooled Odds ratio (OR) estimates were reported with 95% CIs and level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of mortality in users of RAAS blockers with respect to non-users was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, steroid use, and AKI in users with respect to non-users of RAAS blockers were the secondary outcomes. Results: Of 1348 articles identified, 48 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26432 patients from 31 studies included in mortality analysis and 20127 patients from 23 studies included in severity analysis. Majority of the studies (41.6%) were from China. No increased risk of mortality (Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65-1.26), I2=89%) or severity (Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79-1.46), I2=88%) was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension (pooled OR 0.63 (0.46-0.86), I2=58%). Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was found to be high for Europeans (Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52-2.85), I2=77%) and US patients (Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62-2.17) in users of RAAS-blockers. A nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization, two times higher risk of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was observed in US patients on RAAS blockers. No net effect on mortality and severity outcomes was seen in Chinese patients. RAAS blocker usage did not have any effect on corticosteroid use and AKI in Chinese patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of RAAS blockers is not associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Reduced mortality is seen in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and therefore the drugs should be continued in this subset. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Pharmacogenomic differences may explain the ethnicity related variations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Upinder Kaur","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Sankha Shubhra Chakrabarti","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Tejas K Patel","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Gorakhpur"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hirschhorn","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Teresa Zembower","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joyce Ho","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naomi Kalume","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ojoma Agbo","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Zhu","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Laura Rasmussen-Torvic","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sadiya Khan","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Carnethon","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Huffman","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlesnika Evans","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20191940","rel_title":"Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from airways in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses","rel_date":"2020-09-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20191940","rel_abs":"To understand the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients we simultaneously assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, live infectious virus in the airways, and virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in sera in 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and\/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and\/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and\/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019). CONCLUSION: Early intervention with HCQ-based therapy in patients with mild to moderate symptoms at presentation is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients, including hospital admissions, ICU admission, and\/or death.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarek Sulaiman","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Abdulrhman Mohana","author_inst":"Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Laila Alawdah","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nagla Mahmoud","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Hassanein","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Tariq Wani","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Amel Alfaifi","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Eissa Alenazi","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nashwa Radwan","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nasser AlKhalifah","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

However, more accurate forecasts are often needed at near term for planning and staffing. We present our early results from a systemic analysis of short-term adjustment of epidemiological modeling of COVID 19 pandemic in US during March-April 2020. Our analysis includes the importance of various types of features for short term adjustment of the predictions. In addition, we explore the potential of data augmentation to address the data limitation for an emerging pandemic. Following published literature, we employ data augmentation via clustering of regions and evaluate a number of clustering strategies to identify early patterns from the data. From our early analysis, we used CovidActNow as our underlying epidemiological model and found that the most impactful features for the one-day prediction horizon are population density, workers in commuting flow, number of deaths in the day prior to prediction date, and the autoregressive features of new COVID-19 cases from three previous dates of the prediction. Interestingly, we also found that counties clustered with New York County resulted in best preforming model with maximum of R2= 0.90 and minimum of R2= 0.85 for state-based and COVID-based clustering strategy, respectively.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah KEFAYATI","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Hu Huang","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Prithwish Chakraborty","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Fred Roberts","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Raman Srinivasan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Sayali Pethe","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Piyush Madan","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Ajay Deshpande","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Jianying Hu","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Jackson","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashwin Aravindakshan","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rn Boehnke","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Gholami","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh Nayak","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Vishrawas Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Raman Srinivasan","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Sayali Pethe","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Piyush Madan","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Ajay Deshpande","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Jianying Hu","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Jackson","author_inst":"IBM Watson Health"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

A synthesis of this large corpus of data is needed. Purpose: To evaluate the quality of serological studies and provide a global picture of seroprevalence across demographic and occupational groups, and to provide guidance for conducting better serosurveys. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN and Wellcome were searched for English-language papers published from December 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Study selection: Serological studies that evaluated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Data extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies. Data Synthesis: Most of 178 serological studies, representing tests in >800,000 individuals, identified were of low quality. Close contacts and high-risk healthcare workers had higher seroprevalence of 22.9% (95% CI: 11.1-34.7%) and 14.9% (4.8-25.0%), compared to low-risk healthcare workers and general population of 5.5% (4.6-6.4%) and 6.3% (5.5-7.1%). Generally, young people (0-20 yrs) were less likely to be seropositive compared to the middle-aged (21-55 yrs) populations (RR, 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-0.8). Seroprevalence correlated with clinical COVID-19 reports with 10 (range: 2 to 34) infections per confirmed COVID-19 case. Limitations: Some heterogeneity cannot be well explained quantitatively. Conclusions: The overall quality of seroprevalence studies examined was low. The relatively low seroprevalence among general populations suggest that in most settings, antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached. Given that ratio of infections to confirmed cases is on the same order of magnitude across different locales, reported case numbers may help provide insights into the proportion of the population infected.

To apprehend the transmission of COVID-19 and the improvement of air quality, we have studied air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and NO2), CO2 emission, and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) in the extremely polluted and densely populated Southeast Asian megacity Dhaka, Bangladesh from March to June 2020. The Kendall and Spearman correlations were chosen to test the connotation of air quality and climate variables with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 were 65.0 with STD of 37.9 and 87.1 with STD of 52.8 microgram m-3, and 427 with STD of 11.8 ppm, respectively. The average PM2.5 and PM10 drastically reduced up to 62% during COVID-19 lockdown in Dhaka comparing with March 2020 (before lockdown). Comparing with the same period in 2019, PM2.5 reduced up to 33.5%. The average NO2 concentration was 35.0 micromol m-2 during the lockdown period in April, whereas 175.0 micromol m-2 during March (before lockdown). A significant correlation was observed between COVID-19 cases and air quality indicators. A strong correlation was obtained between climate variables and the total number of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality representing a favorable condition for spreading the virus. Our study will be very expedient for policymakers to establish a mechanism for air pollution mitigation based on scientific substantiation, and also will be an essential reference for the advance research to improve urban air quality and the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the tropical nations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Riad Sarkar Pavel","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Abdus Salam","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Mahbuba Yesmin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Enam Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nazmul Ahsan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Shahid Uz Zaman","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Farah Jeba","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Zeyao Zhao","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel T Leung","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

Access to contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in the time of a global crisis because it is associated with health benefits. It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA). Method: The first secondary dataset on coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 6,829 respondents. Data was analysed using chi-square and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Over one-quarter of South Africans could not access contraception and more than every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public or government hospital as source of contraception. Female South Africans (OR=0.89 CI:0.7487-1.0719) and those aged 65 years above (OR=0.67 CI:0.4485-0.9988) were 33% and 11% respectively less likely to have access to contraception. The preferred sources of contraception were associated with the selected demographic and economic variables at P<0.05.

This is often not true for diagnostic tests, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Here, we develop Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for Imperfect Tests (LQAS-IMP) to address this issue and apply it to a COVID-19 serosurveillance study in Haiti. Development: As part of the standard LQAS procedure, the user specifies allowable classification errors for the system, which is defined by a sample size and decision rule. We show that when an imperfect diagnostic test is used, the classification errors are larger than specified. We derive a modified procedure, LQAS-IMP, that accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test to yield correct classification errors. Application: At Zanmi Lasante health facilities in Haiti, the goal was to assess the prior circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) using a limited number of antibody tests. As the COVID-19 antibody tests were known to have imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we used the LQAS-IMP procedure to define valid systems for sampling at eleven hospitals in Haiti. Conclusions: The LQAS-IMP procedure accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity in system design; if the accuracy of a test is known, the use of LQAS-IMP extends LQAS to applications for indicators that are based on laboratory tests, such as COVID-19 antibodies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel R Fulcher","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mary Clisbee","author_inst":"Zanmi Lasante"},{"author_name":"Wesler Lambert","author_inst":"Zanmi Lasante"},{"author_name":"Fernet Renand Leandre","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bethany Hedt-Gauthier","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Farah Jeba","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Zeyao Zhao","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel T Leung","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alqahtani","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalid Abdalla","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Yousif Yousif","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fuad Awwad","author_inst":"Quantitative analysis department, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AlabdulKareem","author_inst":"Assisting Deputyship for Primary Health Care, Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh.

Studies have suggested promising outcomes using monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1{beta} (Anakinra) or IL6 (Tocilizumab), however no head to head comparison was done between the two treatments. Herein, we report our experience in treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm with either subcutaneous Anakinra given concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or intravenous Tocilizumab. Methods: Comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our hospital between March and May 2020 were collected. Patients who received either Anakinra\/ IVIG or Tocilizumab were selected. Baseline characteristics including oxygen therapy, respiratory status evaluation using ROX index, clinical assessment using NEWS score and laboratory data were collected. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, ICU admission and length of stay. In addition, we compared the change in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers at days 7 and 14 post initiation of therapy. Results: 84 consecutive patients who received either treatment (51 in the Anakinra\/ IVIG group and 33 in the Tocilizumab group) were retrospectively studied. Baseline inflammatory markers were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference regarding to death (21.6% vs 15.2%, p 0.464), intubation (15.7% vs 24.2%, p 0.329), ICU need (57.1% vs 48.5%, p 0.475) or length of stay (13+9.6 vs 14.9+11.6, p 0.512) in the Anakinra\/IVIG and Tocilizumab, respectively. Additionally, the rate of improvement in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers was similar in both groups at days 7 and 14. Furthermore, there was no difference in the incidence of superinfection in both groups. Conclusion: Treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm features with either subcutaneous Anakinra\/IVIG or intravenous Tocilizumab is associated with improved clinical outcomes in most subjects. The choice of treatment does not appear to affect morbidity or mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our study findings.

The aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of drugs used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Method. We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization), virological clearance, and severe adverse events. Results. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Ten articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. Conclusions. Dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. Significance of results. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries; since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a less common type of stroke which might be triggered by COVID-19. We present a series of CVST cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. Results: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS[&le;]2) and three patients died in hospital. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly older (50.9 versus 36.7 years, p<0.001), had a lower rate of identified CVST risk factors (23.1% versus 84.2%, p<0.001), had more frequent cortical vein involvement (38.5% versus 10.5%, p: 0.025), and a non-significant higher rate of in-hospital mortality (23.1% versus 5.3%, p: 0.073). Conclusion: CVST should be considered as potential comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with neurological symptoms. Our data suggest that compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, CVST occurs in older patients, with lower rates of known CVST risk factors and might lead to a poorer outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashkan Mowla","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Banafsheh Shakibajahromi","author_inst":"Clinical Neurology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shima Shahjouei","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Afshin Borhani-Haghighi","author_inst":"Clinical Neurology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Nasrin Rahimian","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Yasrebi Hospital, Kashan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Humain Baharvahdat","author_inst":"Division of Neuroendovascular surgery, Department of Neurosurgery, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Fariborz Khorvash","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Davar Altafi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Alavi Hospital, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran"},{"author_name":"Seyed Amir Ebrahimzadeh","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Yasrebi Hospital, Kashan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Ghasem Farahmand","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Vaghefi Far","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Vijay K.

In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02\/26\/2020 to 07\/14\/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current\/past smoking status. The model can be applied to predict risk of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not easily available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hesam Dashti","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Elise Roche","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Bates","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samia Mora","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Olga Demler","author_inst":"Division of Preventive Medicine"},{"author_name":"Humain Baharvahdat","author_inst":"Division of Neuroendovascular surgery, Department of Neurosurgery, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Fariborz Khorvash","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Davar Altafi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Alavi Hospital, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran"},{"author_name":"Seyed Amir Ebrahimzadeh","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Yasrebi Hospital, Kashan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Ghasem Farahmand","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Vaghefi Far","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Vijay K.

COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from [~]4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells - this may limit virion production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zintis Inde","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Clarence Yapp","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Gaurav N Joshi","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johan Spetz","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cameron Fraser","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brian Deskin","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisa Ghelfi","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chhinder Sodhi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"David Hackam","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Lester Kobzik","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Croker","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Douglas Brownfield","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongpeng Jia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kristopher A.

Ray and A. Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1 and Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.\n\nImportanceThe implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently anticipated.

The acceleration of new cases is important for the characterization and comparison of epidemic curves. The objective of this work is to measure the diversity of epidemic curves and understand the importance of socioeconomic variables in the acceleration, peak cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazilian states. Methods: This is an ecological study with time series analysis of new cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazil and its 27 federation units. Using the polynomial interpolation method, we calculated the daily cases and deaths with the measurement of the respective acceleration. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the epidemic curve data and socioeconomic data. Results: The combination of daily data and acceleration determined that the states of Brazil are in different stages of the epidemic. Maximum acceleration of peak cases, peak of cases, maximum acceleration of deaths and peak of deaths are associated with the Gini index and population density, but did not correlate with HDI and per capita income. Conclusion: Brazilian states showed heterogeneous data curves. Densitypopulation and socioeconomic inequality are associated with worse control of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Airandes S Pinto","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Rodrigues","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Carlito L Sobrinho","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Edval G Santos Jr.","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Livia A Cruz","author_inst":"Grupo Baiano de Oncologia"},{"author_name":"Paulo C Nunes","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Matheus G Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Manoel O Rocha","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"David Hackam","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Lester Kobzik","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Croker","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Douglas Brownfield","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongpeng Jia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kristopher A.
