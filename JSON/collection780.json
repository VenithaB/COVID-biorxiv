We derive the basic reproduction number R0 and study the local stability of the disease-free and endemic states. Since the condition R0 < 1 for our model does not determine if the disease will die out, we consider the backward bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation to understand the dynamics of the disease at the occurrence of a second wave and the kind of treatment measures needed to curtail it. Our results show that the limited availability of medical resources favours the emergence of complex dynamics that complicates the control of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Adeyemi Oluyori","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"\u00c1ngel G.

Methods: A population-based household survey was performed in the State of Maranhao, Brazil, from 27 July 2020 to 8 August 2020 to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 using a serum testing electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A three-stage cluster sampling stratified by four state regions was used. The estimates took clustering, stratification, and non-response into account. Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas e601 analyser (Roche Diagnostics). Findings: A total of 3156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 62.2% had more than three symptoms, 11.1% had one or two symptoms, and 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 0.17%, higher for males and advanced age groups. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2. Interpretation: To the best of our knowledge, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 estimated in this population-based survey was the highest and the closest to the herd immunity threshold reported to date. Our results suggest that the herd immunity threshold is not as low as 20%, but at least higher than or equal to around 40%. The infection fatality rate was one of the lowest reported so far, and the proportion of asymptomatic cases was low.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ant\u00f4nio Augusto Moura da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"L\u00eddio Gon\u00e7alves Lima Neto","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Sa\u00fade do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Concei\u00e7\u00e3o de Maria Pedrozo e Silva de Azevedo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"L\u00e9a M\u00e1rcia Melo da Costa","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Sa\u00fade do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Maylla Luana Barbosa Martins Bragan\u00e7a","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Allan Kardec Duailibe Barros Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Bastos Wittlin","author_inst":"Hospital Universit\u00e1rio da Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Bruno Feres de Souza Sr.","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Bruno Luciano Carneiro Alves de Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Carolina Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"\u00c9rika B\u00e1rbara Abreu Fonseca Thomaz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Eudes Alves Sim\u00f5es Neto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Jamesson Ferreira Leite J\u00fanior","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Sa\u00fade do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"L\u00e9cia Maria Sousa Santos Cosme","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Sa\u00fade do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Marcos Adriano Garcia Campos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Rejane Christine de Sousa Queiroz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio Souza Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vit\u00f3ria Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vanda Maria Ferreira Sim\u00f3es","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Alcione Miranda dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.28.20183848","rel_title":"Social Determinants Associated with COVID-19 Mortality in the United States","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.28.20183848","rel_abs":"This study examines social determinants associated with disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates in the United States.Using county-level data, 42 negative binomial mixed models were used to evaluate the impact of social determinants on COVID-19 outcome.

Then, the high-risk terms found to be significant were controlled for in an association study between 41 social determinants and COVID-19 mortality rates. The results describe that ethnic minorities, immigrants, socioeconomic inequalities, and early exposure to COVID-19 are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality, while the prevalence of asthma, suicide, and excessive drinking is associated with decreased mortality. Overall, we recognize that social inequality places disadvantaged groups at risk, which must be addressed through future policies and pro-grams. Additionally, we reveal possible relationships between lung disease, mental health, and COVID-19 that need to be explored on a clinical level.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shayom Debopadhaya","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Ariella D Sprague","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Hongxi Mou","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Tiburon L Benavides","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Sarah M Ahn","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Cole A Reschke","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"John S Erickson","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Kristin P Bennett","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Luciano Carneiro Alves de Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Carolina Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"\u00c9rika B\u00e1rbara Abreu Fonseca Thomaz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Eudes Alves Sim\u00f5es Neto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Jamesson Ferreira Leite J\u00fanior","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Sa\u00fade do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"L\u00e9cia Maria Sousa Santos Cosme","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Sa\u00fade do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Marcos Adriano Garcia Campos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Rejane Christine de Sousa Queiroz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio Souza Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vit\u00f3ria Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vanda Maria Ferreira Sim\u00f3es","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Alcione Miranda dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.20126201","rel_title":"Sex-based clinical and immunological differences in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20126201","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Males and females differ in their immunological responses to foreign pathogens. However, most of the current COVID-19 clinical practices and trials do not take sex as consideration. Methods: We performed an unbiased sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels of 1,558 males and 1,499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. Total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)- specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. Results: We found that the mortality and ICU admission rates were approximately 2-fold higher in males than that in females (P<0.005). Survival analysis revealed that sex is an independent prognostic factor for COVID-19 (Hazard ratio=2.2, P=0.003). The concentration of inflammatory factors in peripheral blood was significantly higher in males. Besides, the renal and hepatic abnormality induced by COVID-19 was more common in males during the hospitalization. The analysis of lymphocyte subsets revealed that the percentage of CD19+ B cell and CD4+ T cell was significantly higher in females (P<0.001) during hospitalization, indicating the stronger humoral immunity in females than males. Notably, the protective IgG sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in females, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week in males. Conclusions: The unfavorable prognosis of male COVID-19 patients may result from the weak humoral immunity and indolent antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. Early medical intervention and close monitoring are important, especially for male COVID-19 patients. Hormonal or convalescent plasma therapy may help improve the immunity of males to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kening Li","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Huang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yun Cai","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine & Blood Transfusion, the 907th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lingxiang Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mengyan Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Li","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ziyu Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wanlin Li","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lishen Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qianghu Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio Souza Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vit\u00f3ria Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vanda Maria Ferreira Sim\u00f3es","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Alcione Miranda dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20183616","rel_title":"A Comparison of Covid-19 Patient Characteristics Before versus After Partial Lockdown in Vietnam","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20183616","rel_abs":"Background. Given the sudden rapid spread of the Covid-19 in the community since 25 July 2020, an updated analysis of Covid-19 cases was conducted to examine the differences of characteristics of Covid-19 patients before versus after partial lockdown end in Vietnam. Methods. Data of 569 Covid-19 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 23 January to 31 July was collected from available official databases. We divided Covid-19 situation timeline into two main periods, before lockdown end (23 January - 22 April) and after lockdown end (23 April - 31 July). Results. We found significant variations in the distribution of Covid-19 patients among different provinces between two periods. Covid-19 confirmed patients were older in the time after lockdown end compared to in the period before lockdown end by a median of 5 years. All discharged Covid-19 patients and no Covid-19 death were in the phase before lockdown, while post lockdown period had still remained significant patients being under treatment, especially reported first fatalities. The number of Covid-19 patients who returned from other countries (excluding China) slightly increased through two stages (p >0.05), partially showing that the continuous volume of people returning Vietnam from abroad during the Covid-19 epidemic. Conclusions. Our analysis indicated demographic and epidemiological disparity of Covid-19 patients before versus after loosening the national lockdown in Vietnam. It is important to suggest that, proactive efforts in Covid-19 control after partial lockdown end will be effective when the measures to closely control and monitor repatriation and immigration via the borders of Vietnam are strictly enforced.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hoang-Long Vo","author_inst":"Institute for Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Kim-Duy Vu","author_inst":"Institute for Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yun Cai","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine & Blood Transfusion, the 907th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lingxiang Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mengyan Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Li","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ziyu Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wanlin Li","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lishen Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qianghu Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio Souza Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vit\u00f3ria Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vanda Maria Ferreira Sim\u00f3es","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Alcione Miranda dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.28.20174946","rel_title":"Implementation and validation of a pooling strategy for a sustainable screening campaign for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.28.20174946","rel_abs":"Mass screening aimed at detecting, in asymptomatic subjects, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a strategic measure for the control of the present pandemic. It allows virus carriers to be identified and quarantined, thus preventing local spread and protecting vulnerable individuals. Although the screening strategy should be determined by the epidemiological situation, the size of the population that can be screened is indeed limited by the availability of resources. Here we present the implementation of an 8-sample pool strategy that relies on protocols, reagents and equipment currently used in clinical diagnostics. The method permitted to identify, with 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, samples with low viral load, being the limit of detection of 11 viral copies extracted from the equivalent of 133ul of nasopharyngeal sample-pool. When the protocol has been applied, as a proof of principle, in a real population of 3592 consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs collected by healthcare providers in asymptomatic subjects, 20 positive pools were detected and in 100% of cases the positive specimens identified. Considering these performances, the 8-sample pool will allow, in populations with an expected positive rate of less than 1%, reducing costs by at least 80%, being a suitable method for a sustainable mass screening strategy in a population of asymptomatic subjects.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Cesselli","author_inst":"University of Udine; University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Michela Bulfoni","author_inst":"University of Udine; University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Marzinotto","author_inst":"University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Barbara Marcon","author_inst":"University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Sara Cmet","author_inst":"University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Angela Migotti","author_inst":"University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Anna Rosa Cussigh","author_inst":"University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Romina Martinella","author_inst":"University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Corrado Pipan","author_inst":"University of Udine; University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Paolo Beltrami","author_inst":"University of Udine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Curcio","author_inst":"University of Udine; University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Wei Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lishen Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qianghu Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio Souza Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vit\u00f3ria Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vanda Maria Ferreira Sim\u00f3es","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Alcione Miranda dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20183434","rel_title":"Risk factors for severe outcomes of COVID-19: a rapid review","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20183434","rel_abs":"Background: Identification of high-risk groups is needed to inform COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies in Canada. A rapid review was conducted to determine the magnitude of association between potential risk factors and risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19. Methods: Methods, inclusion criteria, and outcomes were prespecified in a protocol that is publicly available. Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Epistemonikos COVID-19 in LOVE Platform, and McMaster COVID-19 Evidence Alerts, and select websites were searched to 15 June 2020. Studies needed to be conducted in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and have used multivariate analyses to adjust for potential confounders. After piloting, screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were all performed by a single reviewer. Authors collaborated to synthesize the findings narratively and appraise the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. Results: Of 3,740 unique records identified, 34 were included in the review. The studies included median 596 (range 44 to 418,794) participants with a mean age between 42 and 84 years. Half of the studies (17\/34) were conducted in the United States and 19\/34 (56%) were rated as good quality. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large ([&ge;]2-fold) association with increased risk of hospitalization in people having confirmed COVID-19, for the following risk factors: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age over 45 years (vs. younger), male gender, Black race\/ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic white), homelessness, and low income (vs. above average). Age over 60 and 70 years may be associated with large increases in the rate of mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large association with increased risk may exist for liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs. British white), age over 45 years (vs. <45 years), age over 80 years (vs. 65-69 years), and male gender in those 20-64 years (but not older). Associations with hospitalization and mortality may be very large ([&ge;]5-fold increased risk) for those aged over 60 years. Conclusion: Among other factors, increasing age (especially >60 years) appears to be the most important risk factor for severe outcomes among those with COVID-19. There is a need for high quality primary research (accounting for multiple confounders) to better understand the level of risk that might be associated with immigration or refugee status, religion or belief system, social capital, substance use disorders, pregnancy, Indigenous identity, living with a disability, and differing levels of risk among children.

Adjusting for deprivation, proportion of ethnic minority population and proportion of key workers among the working population, mortality data from England show good evidence for an increasing trend with population density until a saturating level. Projections from a mathematical model that accounts for this observation deviate markedly from the current status quo for SARS-CoV-2 models which either assume linearity between density and transmission (30% of models) or no relationship at all (70%). Respectively, these standard model structures over- and under-estimate the delay in infection resurgence following the release of lockdown. Models have had a prominent role in SARS-CoV-2 intervention strategy; identifying saturation points for given populations and including transmission terms that account for this feature will improve model utility.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily Nightingale","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Brady","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Laith Yakob","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Samantha Guitard","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Sholeh Rahman","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Andrew Beck","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Ben Vandermeer","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hartling","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Corrado Pipan","author_inst":"University of Udine; University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Paolo Beltrami","author_inst":"University of Udine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Curcio","author_inst":"University of Udine; University Hospital of Udine"},{"author_name":"Wei Wu","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lishen Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qianghu Wang","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio Souza Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vit\u00f3ria Abreu de Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Vanda Maria Ferreira Sim\u00f3es","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Britto e Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"},{"author_name":"Alcione Miranda dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Maranh\u00e3o"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182444","rel_title":"Convalescent Plasma for COVID-19: A multicenter, randomized clinical trial","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182444","rel_abs":"Background: Passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma (CP) is a potential treatment for COVID-19 for which evidence from controlled clinical trials is lacking. Methods: We conducted a multi-center, randomized clinical trial in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. All patients received standard of care treatment, including off-label use of marketed medicines, and were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose (250-300 mL) of CP from donors with IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in categories 5, 6 or 7 of the COVID-19 ordinal scale at day 15. Results: The trial was stopped after first interim analysis due to the fall in recruitment related to pandemic control. With 81 patients randomized, there were no patients progressing to mechanical ventilation or death among the 38 patients assigned to receive plasma (0%) versus 6 out of 43 patients (14%) progressing in control arm. Mortality rates were 0% vs 9.3% at days 15 and 29 for the active and control groups, respectively (log-rank p=0.056). No significant differences were found in secondary endpoints. At inclusion, patients had a median time of 8 days (IQR, 6-9) of symptoms and 49,4% of them were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Conclusions: Convalescent plasma could be superior to standard of care in avoiding progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The strong dependence of results on a limited number of events in the control group prevents drawing firm conclusions about CP efficacy from this trial.

Despite a constant background mutational rate, the virus must retain binding with ACE2 for infectivity, providing a conserved constraint for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To prevent mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2 and to prepare for future related coronavirus outbreaks, we engineered a de novo trimeric ACE2 (T-ACE2) protein scaffold that binds the trimeric spike protein with extremely high affinity (KD < 1 pM), while retaining ACE2 native sequence. T-ACE2 potently inhibits all tested pseudotyped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2. The cryo-EM structure reveals that T-ACE2 can induce the transit of spike protein to \"three-up\" RBD conformation upon binding. T-ACE2 thus represents a promising class of broadly neutralizing proteins against SARS-CoVs and mutants.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liang Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Bi","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xinling Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Renhong Yan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yaning Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Mingfeng Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xingyue Bao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Bobo Dang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Maria Lourdes Porras-Leal","author_inst":"Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real"},{"author_name":"Maria del Castillo Jarilla-Fernandez","author_inst":"Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real"},{"author_name":"Jose Ramon Pano-Pardo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Zaragoza-IIS Aragon"},{"author_name":"Jose Antonio Moreno-Chulilla","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Itziar Arrieta-Aldea","author_inst":"Hospital del Mar.

Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38\/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.\n\nImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses. These finding have timely significance for selection of appropriate individuals as donors for plasma intervention strategies, as well as determining vaccine efficacy.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaustuv Nayak","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kamalvishnu Gottimukkala","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanjeev Kumar","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elluri Seetharami Reddy","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Venkata Vishwanadh Edara","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Robert Kauffman","author_inst":"Emory"},{"author_name":"Katharine Floyd","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Grace Mantus","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Deepali Savargaonkar","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research"},{"author_name":"Pawan Kumar Goel","author_inst":"Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College"},{"author_name":"Satyam Arora","author_inst":"Super Speciality Pediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Training Institute"},{"author_name":"Manju Rahi","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Carl W.

The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nir Drayman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Krysten A Jones","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sarra-Anne Azizi","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Heather M Froggatt","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Kemin Tan","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ivanova Maltseva","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Siquan Chen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vlad Nicolaescu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Steve Dvorkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kevin Furlong","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rahul S Kathayat","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mason R Firpo","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mastrodomenico","author_inst":"Loyoloa University"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Madaline M Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Munoz-Alia","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Brooke Schuster","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Nair","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Madrigal","author_inst":"Centro de Transfusion de Ciudad Real"},{"author_name":"Enric Contreras","author_inst":"Banc de Sang i Teixits.

Here, we explore how to leverage the increasing reliability and scale of both molecular and serological tests to balance transmission risks with economic costs involved in responding to Covid-19 epidemics. First, we introduce an optimal control approach that identifies personalized interaction rates according to an individual's test status; such that infected individuals isolate, recovered individuals can elevate their interactions, and activity of susceptible individuals varies over time. Critically, the extent to which susceptible individuals can return to work depends strongly on isolation efficiency. As we show, optimal control policies can yield mitigation policies with similar infection rates to total shutdown but lower socioeconomic costs. However, optimal control policies can be fragile given mis-specification of parameters or mis-estimation of the current disease state. Hence, we leverage insights from the optimal control solutions and propose a feedback control approach based on monitoring of the epidemic state. We utilize genetic algorithms to identify a `switching' policy such that susceptible individuals (both PCR and serological test negative) return to work after lockdowns insofar as recovered fraction is much higher than the circulating infected prevalence. This feedback control policy exhibits similar performance results to optimal control, but with greater robustness to uncertainty. Overall, our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanlin Li","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shashwat Shivam","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael E.

Accurate and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases is essential for correct medical treatment to control this pandemic. Compared with the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, chest radiography imaging techniques are shown to be more effective to detect coronavirus. For the limitation of available medical images, transfer learning is better suited to classify patterns in medical images. This paper presents a combined architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-rays. The deep transfer techniques used in this experiment are VGG19, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2. CNN is used to extract complex features from samples and classified them using RNN. The VGG19-RNN architecture achieved the best performance among all the networks in terms of accuracy and computational time in our experiments. Finally, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize class-specific regions of images that are responsible to make decision. The system achieved promising results compared to other existing systems and might be validated in the future when more samples would be available. The experiment demonstrated a good alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 for medical staff.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Providers working in our ED perceived an increase in severity and frequency of these types of presentations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A retrospective list of frequent attenders (FA) presenting five or more times to the ED between two 122-day periods were examined: 01 Mar to 30 Jun 2019 (Control) and 2020 (COVID-19). The FA group were then examined to identify patients presenting with MUS (FA-MUS). Results The total number of ED attendances during the control period was n=42,785 which reduced to n=28,806 in the COVID-19 period, a decrease of 32.7%. The control FA cohort had n=44 FA-MUS patients with 149 ED visits. This increased to n=65 FA-MUS patients with 267 visits during COVID-19, p=0.44. There was a significant increase in the proportion of all ED visits that were FA-MUS: 0.3% (control) compared to 0.9% (COVID-19); OR 2.7, p<0.001. There was a significant increase in shortness of breath amongst MUS during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the control period (p<0.01), with no significant difference in any other MUS category. Conclusion Whilst the total number of ED attendances reduced by almost one third during COVID-19, the actual number of all visits by frequent attenders with MUS increased and the proportion of attendances by these tripled during the same period. This presents an increasing challenge to ED clinicians who may feel underprepared to manage these patients effectively.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natasha Faye Daniels","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Raiiq Ridwan","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Edward BG Barnard","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Talha Muneer Amanullah","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Catherine Hayhurst","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ivanova Maltseva","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Siquan Chen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vlad Nicolaescu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Steve Dvorkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kevin Furlong","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rahul S Kathayat","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mason R Firpo","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mastrodomenico","author_inst":"Loyoloa University"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Madaline M Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Munoz-Alia","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Brooke Schuster","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Nair","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Madrigal","author_inst":"Centro de Transfusion de Ciudad Real"},{"author_name":"Enric Contreras","author_inst":"Banc de Sang i Teixits.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of the arrival electrolytes and symptoms in prediction of Lung damage in CT scan based on the CO-RADS system. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analytical study. We included patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection, June 15 to July 7. Patients were included in study if there were no previous history of kidney disease. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and CO-RADS High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of lung report were collected. Univariate logistic regression was employed first to identify the effective, correlated items. All statistics were performed with SPSS version 18.0. Results: In the current study, 36 (20 male- 16 female) patients with mean age of the 54.7 (STD:17.5) years old were studied. Most common symptom at the arrival was the Fever (52.8%), followed by Fatigue (18%), and dyspnea (44.4%). Computed tomography assessment revealed CO-RADS 2 in 4 (11.1%) patients, CO-RADS 3 in 1 (2.8%), CO-RADS 4 in 20 (55.6%), and CO-RADS 5 in 11 (30.6%) patients. In the comparison with the study groups based on the HRCT status (CO-RADS II,III vs. CO-RADS IV,V), patients with severe HRCT damage had significantly lower level of Phosphorus (P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that only one factors was associated with HRCT damage status (Phosphorus, P=0.040). Phosphorus upper than 4.5 was associated with better HRCT results with OR ratio of 3.71 (X2(1)=5.69; p=0.017). Conclusion: Our study illustrates that higher phosphate levels may be associated with better CT scan of lung outcomes in COVID-19; while hypophosphatemia is associated with severe lung injuries. This could help clinicians to manage hospitalized patients and may link the COVID-19 and parathyroid gland.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farshid Javdani","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Shima Parsa","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Heshmatollah Shakeri","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Naser Hatami","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Navid Kalani","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Marzieh Haghbeen","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Rahim Raufi","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alireza Abbasi","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Pouyan Keshavarz","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Seyyed Abbas Hashemi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."},{"author_name":"Amin shafiee","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mason R Firpo","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mastrodomenico","author_inst":"Loyoloa University"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Madaline M Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Munoz-Alia","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Brooke Schuster","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Nair","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Madrigal","author_inst":"Centro de Transfusion de Ciudad Real"},{"author_name":"Enric Contreras","author_inst":"Banc de Sang i Teixits.

Disparities in social and structural determinants of health disproportionately affect those experiencing incarceration, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. Additionally, prisons are sites of congregate living, making it impossible to practice social distancing, and most prisons have relied only on incremental measures to reduce risk and spread of COVID-19. To more fully understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on incarcerated populations, it is critical to have systematic data on testing, test positivity, cases, and case fatality. Using data from the COVID Prison Project, we present data on 53 prison systems COVID-19 testing, test positivity, case, and case fatality by state and compare these data with each state's general population. Results: Many states are not reporting full information on COVID testing with some also not reporting on case fatality. Among those reporting data, there is a wide variation between testing, test positivity, and case rates within prison systems and as compared to the general population. However, when more tests are deployed more cases are identified with the majority of state prisons having higher case rates than their general population. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for the implementation and study of COVID-19 mitigation and surveillance strategies to flatten the COVID-19 curve in prisons across the country. We call for future research to build on this data from the COVID Prison Project to protect the health of our nations' often forgotten residents.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine LeMasters","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Erin McCauley","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Nowotny","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Yao Yao","author_inst":"Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies, National School of Development, Peking University, Beijing"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Vedanthan","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chenkai Wu","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Lijing L.

Methods: Seven online, text-based focus groups were conducted with a total of 42 participants. Eligible participants included adults living in Canada that prepared meals at home at least once per week. Focus groups took place from May-June 2020 and followed a semi-structured question guide. Participants were asked about their practices relating to food preparation habits at home; food purchasing, handling, and storage; hand hygiene and sanitation; and information sources about food safety concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. A thematic analysis was conducted using the Theoretical Domains Framework as a coding guide. Results: The most notable changes in behaviour since the onset of the pandemic were seen in participants' hand washing, sanitation, and grocery shopping practices. Participants tended to perceive grocery store employees, shoppers, and food service staff as having inadequate sanitation precautions and, therefore, as a source of COVID-19 transmission risk. They heavily relied on public health, medical, and government officials as sources of information. Feelings of stress and anxiety appeared to be linked to certain sanitation behaviours. Many participants displayed a general apathy toward routine food safety practices such as safe food storage at home. Conclusion: This work supports the need for clear and concise messaging for hand hygiene and food safety behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future times of crisis. It also highlights a need for ongoing food safety messaging.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robyn Haas","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Fatih Sekercioglu","author_inst":"Ryerson University"},{"author_name":"Richard Meldrum","author_inst":"Ryerson University"},{"author_name":"Ian Young","author_inst":"Ryerson University"},{"author_name":"Yao Yao","author_inst":"Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies, National School of Development, Peking University, Beijing"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Vedanthan","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chenkai Wu","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Lijing L.

Methods Epidemiological information and clinical data were collected from 35 children patients. Viral RNAs in respiratory and fecal samples were detected. Plasma of 11 patients were collected and measured for 48 cytokines. Results 40% (14\/35) of the children COVID-19 patients showed asymptomatic infections, while pneumonia shown by CT scan occurred in most of the cases (32\/35, 91.43%). Elevated LDH, AST, CRP, neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in some cases, and CD4 and CD8 counts were normal. A total of 22 cytokines were significantly higher than the healthy control, and IP-10, IFN-2 of them in children were significantly lower than the adult patients. Meanwhile, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1, and IL-1ra were similar or lower than healthy control, while significantly lower than adult patients. Viral RNAs were detected as early as the first day after illness onset (d.a.o) in both the respiratory and fecal samples. Viral RNAs decreased as the disease progression and mostly became negative in respiratory samples within 18 d.a.o, while maintained relatively stable during the disease progression and still detectable in some cases during 36~42 d.a.o. Conclusion COVID-19 in children was mild, and asymptomatic infection was common. Immune responses were relatively normal in children COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm also occurred in children patients, while much weaker than adult patients. Positive rate of viral RNAs in fecal samples was high, and profile of viral shedding were different between respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haixia Zheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Peng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinli Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanrong Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaohe Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Peng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shisong Fang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yanjie Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kai Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Xing","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengli Cao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Madrigal","author_inst":"Centro de Transfusion de Ciudad Real"},{"author_name":"Enric Contreras","author_inst":"Banc de Sang i Teixits.

This study is purposed to explore the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and reliable detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray imaging. In this study, reliable pre-trained deep learning algorithms were applied to achieve the automatic detection of COVID-19-induced pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images. Moreover, the study aims to evaluate the performance of advanced neural architectures proposed for the classification of medical images over recent years. The data set used in the experiments involves 274 COVID-19 cases, 380 viral pneumonia, and 380 healthy cases, which was derived from several open sources of X-Rays, and the data available online. The confusion matrix provided a basis for testing the post-classification model. Furthermore, an open-source library PYCM was used to support the statistical parameters. The study revealed the superiority of Model vgg16 over other models applied to conduct this research where the model performed best in terms of overall scores and based-class scores. According to the research results, deep Learning with X-ray imaging is useful in the collection of critical biological markers associated with COVID-19 infection. The technique is conducive for the physicians to make a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, the high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mundher Taresh Sr.","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Ningbo Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Talal Ahmed Ali Ali Sr.","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Jinli Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanrong Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaohe Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Peng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shisong Fang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yanjie Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kai Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Xing","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengli Cao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Madrigal","author_inst":"Centro de Transfusion de Ciudad Real"},{"author_name":"Enric Contreras","author_inst":"Banc de Sang i Teixits.

This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the systemic cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production to Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), and Spike S1 subunit (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 develops over the first 10 to 20 days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219\/255 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient specimens, 86%) suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age were all associated with differences in antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 antigens which may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the production of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients over the course of infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-18) and chemotactic markers (IP-10, SDF-1, MIP-1{beta}, MCP-1, and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, RANTES, TNF-, GRO-, and MIP-1 relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients that succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production. Furthermore, patients that succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and also tended to have high ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies. This study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 immunity implicating the magnitude and specificity of response in relation to patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander M.

The results of the study indicate that during the transformation of hospitals from general medical practice into dedicated COVID-19 facilities, the number of CT examinations increased up to 30%; the collective dose from CT exams increased up to a factor of 1.5. During a partial transformation of a medical facility into the hospital with separate COVID-19 departments, the increase in the number of CT examinations in the facility was more significant (up to a factor of 2 or more). These numbers correspond to 1.5 - 2.5 chest CT examinations (from 1 to 6) per patient admitted to hospital with COVID-19 diagnosis; and 1.2 chest CT examinations per patient in outpatient facilities, including a mandatory CT scan for the staging of COVID-19. The collective dose from CT examinations in the Russian Federation for March-June period of 2020 increased by the factor of 2 (from 16k man-Sv to 32k man-Sv); the collective dose of COVID-19 patients was about 12k man-Sv. For a more detailed and reliable assessment of the dynamics of changes in the structure of diagnostic radiology and levels of radiation exposure of patients in the Russian Federation, data collection in the regions of the Russian Federation and individual medical facilities will continue.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksandr Vodovatov","author_inst":"St-Petersburg Research Institute of Radiation Hygiene after prof.

A comprehensive map of the mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) landscape during SARS-CoV-2 infection and concomitant COVID-19 disease is lacking. We performed 25-color flow cytometry-analysis focusing on MNP lineages in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. While redistribution of monocytes towards intermediate subset and decrease in circulating DCs occurred in response to infection, severe disease associated with appearance of Mo-MDSC-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2. Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineage specific and in select cases associated with severe disease. Finally, unsupervised analysis revealed that the MNP profile, alone, could identify a cluster of COVID-19 non-survivors. This study provides a reference for the MNP response to clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection and unravel myeloid dysregulation associated with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Egle Kvedaraite","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Laura Hertwig","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Indranil Sinha","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ponzetta","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ida Hed Myrberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Magdalini Lourda","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Majda Dzidic","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mira Akber","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rao Muvva","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Puran Chen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Susanna Brighenti","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Lars I.

As of 17 August 2020, there is no specific drug or biologic agent which have been approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological findings of 211 COVID-19 in-patients that were treated between March - August 2020. Confirmation of a COVID-19 diagnosis was made according to a positive RT-PCR result with a consistent high-resolution-CT (HRCT) finding. Radiological images and the rate of clinical response of patients were investigated. Result: While 128 patients (58.7) did not develop pneumonia, the mild, moderate and severe pneumonia ratios were 28(13.2%), 31(18.7%) and 27(22.9%). 72 patients (34.1%) whose PCR tests were positive did not show any symptom and they were followed in isolation without treatment. 52 patients (24.6%) received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 57 patients (27%) received favipiravir and 30 patients (14.2%) received favipiravir plus dexamethosone as the first line of treatment. 63.1% of pneumonia patients who received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 28.3% of patients who received favipravir and 10% of patients who received favipravir plus dexamethasone showed a failure of treatment. Conclusion: The pulmonary infiltrates of COVID-19 are not infective; therefore, the characteristic of the disease should be described as COVID-19 pneumonitis instead of pneumonia. The favipiravir plus dexamethasone seems to be the only drug combination to achieve the improvement of radiological presentation and clinical symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adem Dirican","author_inst":"Samsun Medicalpark Hospital, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Samsun, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Tugce Uzar","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Irem Karaman","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aziz Uluisik","author_inst":"Samsun Liv Hospital, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Samsun, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Sevket Ozkaya","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University,Faculty of Medicine,Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Magdalini Lourda","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Majda Dzidic","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mira Akber","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rao Muvva","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Puran Chen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Susanna Brighenti","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Lars I.

Therefore there is great concern about the susceptibility to the outcome of COVID-19 infected patients with multiple myeloma. This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID-19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders (98 outpatinets and 538 hospitilized patinets) , collected from 10 countries by the International Myeloma Society to understand the initial challenges faced by Myeloma patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics, univariate logistic regression, and multivariate analysis were performed for hospitalized MM patinets. The median age was 69 years, and nearly all patients (96%) had MM. Approximately 36% were recently diagnosed (2019-2020), and 54% of patients were receiving first-line therapy. Thirty-three percent of patients have died, with significant geographic variability, ranging from 27% to 57% of hospitalized patients. Univariate analysis identified age, ISS3, high-risk disease, renal disease, suboptimal myeloma control (active or progressive disease), and one or more comorbidities as risk factors for higher rates of death. Neither history of transplant, including within a year of COVID-19 diagnosis nor other anti-MM treatments were associated with outcomes. Multivariate analysis found that only age, high-risk MM, renal disease, and suboptimal MM control remained independent predictors of adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. The management of MM in the era of COVID-19 requires careful consideration of patient and disease-related factors to decrease the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, while not compromising the disease control through appropriate MM treatment. This study provides the data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients at risk of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehmet K Samur","author_inst":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Martinez-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Octubre, i+12, CNIO, Complutense University, Madrid, Comunidad de Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gordon Cook","author_inst":"Leeds Institute of Clinical Trial Research & Leeds Cancer Centre, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Noa Biran","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Kwee Yong","author_inst":"Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Vania Hungria","author_inst":"Clinica Sao Germano, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Monika Engelhardt","author_inst":"Medical Department, Hematology, Oncology & Stem Cell Transplantation, Clinical Cancer Research Group, Freiburg, Faculty of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Francesca Gay","author_inst":"Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Torino, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ana Garcia-Feria","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hospital de Manises, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Stefania Oliva","author_inst":"Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Torino, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rimke Oostvogels","author_inst":"Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Gozzetti","author_inst":"University of Siena, Department of Hematology, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cara Rosenbaum","author_inst":"Center for Myeloma, New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shaji Kumar","author_inst":"The Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward A Stadtmauer","author_inst":"Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hermann Einsele","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Meral Beksac","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Katja Weisel","author_inst":"II.

Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of face mask use in a community setting and to predict the effectiveness of wearing a mask. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCISEARCH, The Cochrane Library and pre-prints from inception to 22 April 2020 without restriction by language. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane and GRADE approach. Findings: Our search identified 35 studies, including 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (4017 patients), 10 comparative studies (18984 patients), 13 predictive models, 9 laboratory experimental studies. For reducing infection rates, the estimates of cluster-RCTs were in favour of wearing face masks versus no mask, but not at statistically significant levels (adjusted OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.78-1.05). Similar findings were reported in observational studies. Mathematical models indicated an important decrease in mortality when the population mask coverage is near-universal, regardless of mask efficacy. In the best-case scenario, when the mask efficacy is at 95%, the R0 can fall to 0.99 from an initial value of 16.90. Levels of mask filtration efficiency were heterogeneous, depending on the materials used (surgical mask: 45-97%). One laboratory study suggested a viral load reduction of 0.25 (95%CI 0.09-0.67) in favour of mask versus no mask. Interpretation: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the use of face masks in a community setting. Robust randomised trials on face mask effectiveness are needed to inform evidence-based policies.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Coclite","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonello Napoletano","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Gianola","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Unita' di Epidemiologia Clinica"},{"author_name":"Andrea Del Monaco","author_inst":"Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research, Bank of Italy, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniela D'Angelo","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alice Fauci","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Iacorossi","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Latina","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe La Torre","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudio Mastroianni","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Renzi","author_inst":"University College London-UCL, Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Primiano Iannone","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cara Rosenbaum","author_inst":"Center for Myeloma, New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shaji Kumar","author_inst":"The Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward A Stadtmauer","author_inst":"Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hermann Einsele","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Meral Beksac","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Katja Weisel","author_inst":"II.
