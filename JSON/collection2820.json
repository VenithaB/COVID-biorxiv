To test the potential role of vegetables in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of Brassica vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, head cabbage (white, red and savoy cabbage), leafy brassica) and to compare them with spinach, cucumber, courgette, lettuce and tomato. The COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants was obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people over 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage of obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only head cabbage and cucumber reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g\/day increase in the average national consumption of some of the vegetables (head cabbage and cucumber), the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by a factor of 11, down to 13.6 %. Lettuce consumption increased COVID-19 mortality. The adjustment did not change the point estimate and the results were still significant. Discussion The negative ecological association between COVID-19 mortality and the consumption of cabbage and cucumber supports the a priori hypothesis previously reported. The hypothesis needs to be tested in individual studies performed in countries where the consumption of vegetables is common.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susana C Fonseca","author_inst":"GreenUPorto - Sustainable Agrifood Production Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Ioar Rivas","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Dora Romaguera","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Marcos Quijal-Zamorano","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Wienczyslawa Czarlewski","author_inst":"Medical Consulting Czarlewski ; MASK-air"},{"author_name":"Alain Vidal","author_inst":"World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)"},{"author_name":"Joao A Fonseca","author_inst":"CINTESIS, Center for Research in Health Technology and Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Joan Ballester","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Josep M Anto","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Xavier Basagana","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Luis M Cunha","author_inst":"GreenUPorto - Sustainable Agrifood Production Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Jean Bousquet","author_inst":"MACVIA-France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155739","rel_title":"Development and Validation of a Web-Based Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Model","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155739","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) carries high morbidity and mortality globally. Identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration upon presentation would aid in triaging, prognostication, and allocation of resources and experimental treatments. Research Question: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and\/or death? Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%). Results: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated into a mobile-friendly website. Interpretation: This web-based risk prediction model can be used at the bedside for prediction of severe COVID-19 using data mostly available at the time of presentation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sang Hoon Woo","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University"},{"author_name":"Arturo J.

We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system. Methods: Outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review. Results: 1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 165 (16.1%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. At the time of data censoring, 63\/165 patients (38.1%) had died and 102\/165 (61.8%) were still alive. Of the surviving 102 patients, 17 (10.3%) remained on mechanical ventilation, 51 (30.9%) were extubated but remained hospitalized, and 34 (20.6%) had been discharged. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001). 75.7% of patients over 70 years old had died at the time of data analysis. Conversely, 71.2% of patients age 70 or younger were still alive at the time of data analysis. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status. Conclusion: Mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher King","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax"},{"author_name":"Dhwani Sahjwani","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"A Whitney Brown","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Saad Feroz","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paula Cameron","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erik Osborn","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mehul Desai","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Svetolik Djurkovic","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aditya Kasarabada","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hinerman","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Lantry","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Oksana Shlobin","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kareem Ahmad","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Khangoora","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shambhu Aryal","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"A Claire Collins","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alan Speir","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven Nathan","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155382","rel_title":"Identifying organ dysfunction trajectory-based subphenotypes in critically ill patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155382","rel_abs":"Rationale. COVID-19-associated respiratory failure offers the unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the differential host response to a uniform pathogenic insult. Prior studies of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have identified subphenotypes with differential outcomes. Understanding whether there are distinct subphenotypes of severe COVID-19 may offer insight into its pathophysiology. Objectives. To identify and characterize distinct subphenotypes of COVID-19 critical illness defined by the post-intubation trajectory of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Methods. Intubated COVID-19 patients at two hospitals in New York city were leveraged as development and validation cohorts. Patients were grouped into mild, intermediate, and severe strata by their baseline post-intubation SOFA. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed within each stratum to detect subphenotypes based on similarities amongst SOFA score trajectories evaluated by Dynamic Time Warping. Statistical tests defined trajectory subphenotype predictive markers. Measurements and Main Results. Distinct worsening and recovering subphenotypes were identified within each stratum, which had distinct 7-day post-intubation SOFA progression trends. Patients in the worsening suphenotypes had a higher mortality than those in the recovering subphenotypes within each stratum (mild stratum, 29.7% vs. 10.3%, p=0.033; intermediate stratum, 29.3% vs. 8.0%, p=0.002; severe stratum, 53.7% vs. 22.2%, p<0.001). Worsening and recovering subphenotypes were replicated in the validation cohort. Routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and respiratory variables rather than demographics and comorbidities were predictive of the worsening and recovering subphenotypes. Conclusions. There are clear worsening and recovering subphenotypes of COVID-19 respiratory failure after intubation, which are more predictive of outcomes than baseline severity of illness. Organ dysfunction trajectory may be well suited as a surrogate for research in COVID-19 respiratory failure.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chang Su","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhenxing Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Katherine Hoffman","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Parag Goyal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

Once a region has successfully contained the disease, it becomes critical to decide when and how to reopen the borders. Here we explore the impact of border reopening for the example of Newfoundland and Labrador, a Canadian province that has enjoyed no new cases since late April, 2020. We combine a network epidemiology model with machine learning to infer parameters and predict the COVID-19 dynamics upon partial and total airport reopening, with perfect and imperfect quarantine conditions. Our study suggests that upon full reopening, every other day, a new COVID-19 case would enter the province. Under the current conditions, banning air travel from outside Canada is more efficient in managing the pandemic than fully reopening and quarantining 95% of the incoming population. Our study provides quantitative insights of the efficacy of travel restrictions and can inform political decision making in the controversy of reopening.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Proton Rahman","author_inst":"Memorial University"},{"author_name":"Alain Goriely","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

Individuals in both A and I may go directly to an immune class V, and in I to a dead class D. Upon this SCLAIV formulation we impose a set of drivers that can be used to develop policy to manage current Covid-19 and similar type disease outbreaks. These drivers include surveillance, social distancing (rate and efficacy), social relaxation, quarantining (linked to contact tracing), patient treatment\/isolation and vaccination processes that can either be a non-negative constant or an s-shaped switching curve. The latter are defined in terms of onset and switching times, initial and final values, and abruptness of switching. We built a Covid-19 NMB-DASA web app to generate both deterministic and stochastic solutions to our SCLAIV and drivers model and use incidence and mortality data to provide both maximum-likelihood frequentist and Bayesian fitting of parameters. In the context of South African and English Covid-19 incidence data we demonstrate how to both identify and evaluate the role of drivers in ongoing outbreaks. In particular, we show that early social distancing in South Africa likely averted around 80,000 observed cases (actual number is double if only half the case are observed) during the months of June and July. We also demonstrated that incidence rates in South Africa will increase to between a conservative estimate of 15 and 30 thousand observed cases per day (again, actual number considerably higher) by the end of August if stronger social distancing measures are not effected during July and August, 2020. On different a note, we show that comparably good local optimal fits of the English data using surveillance, social distancing and social relaxation drivers can represent very different kinds of outbreaks---one with close to 90% and another with under 8% immune individuals. This latter result provides a cautionary tale of why fitting SEIR-like models to incidence or prevalence data can be extremely problematic when not anchored by other critical measures, such as levels of immunity in the population. Our presentation illustrates how our Covid-19 web app can be used by individuals without any programming skills to carry out forensic and scenario analyses in spatially contained populations such as small countries or metropolitan areas.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wayne M Getz","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley, Dept ESPM"},{"author_name":"Ludovica Luisa-Vissat","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley, Dept ESPM"},{"author_name":"Richard Salter","author_inst":"Oberlin College, Dept Computer Science"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

This study provides admission rates to hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) in Norway, aiming to better understand the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: Data from official reports from The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health were used to calculate admission rates to hospitals and to ICU per 100 000 inhabitants. We compared rates of hospitalisation between the four health regions and provide separate rates for Oslo. We also assessed national admissions to ICU stratified by age. Results: The admission rate in the south-eastern region was 3.1 per 100 000, and the rate for Oslo was 5.8. Compared to the western region (reference), the Oslo rate was 4.0 times (confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.5) higher. In Norway as a whole, the rate of ICU admissions was 3.9 per 100 000, and in the age groups 60-69 and 70-79, ICU rates were 10.3 and 11.5, respectively. These rates were 9.5 (CI 6.3-14.3) and 10.6 (CI 6.9-16.2) times higher compared to people younger than 50 years. Conclusion: Hospital admissions due to Covid-19 are much higher in Oslo than anywhere else in Norway, and in the country as a whole, ICU admissions are highest among people 60-79 years of age. These results and more detailed data could provide better advice on how restrictions can be safely lessened.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morten Munkvik","author_inst":"University of Stavanger"},{"author_name":"Ingvild Vatten Alsnes","author_inst":"University og Stavanger"},{"author_name":"Lars Vatten","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. Methods From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety\/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Results Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and other clinical staff (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Factors significantly protective for burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Max Denning","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ee Teng Goh","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Almonte","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Scott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155887","rel_title":"An overview of current mental health in the general population of Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the COLLATE project","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155887","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses significant mental health challenges globally; however, to date, there is limited community level data. This study reports on the first wave of data from the COLLATE project (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy), an ongoing study aimed at understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Australians. This paper addresses prevailing primary concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, current levels of negative emotions and risk factors predicting these negative emotions. On April 1st to 4th 2020, 5158 adult members of the Australian general public completed an online survey. Participants ranked their top ten current primary concerns about COVID-19, and completed standardized measures to ascertain levels of negative emotions (specifically, depression, anxiety and stress). Socio-demographic information was also collected and used in the assessment of risk factors. The top three primary concerns were all related to the health and well-being of family and loved ones. As expected, levels of negative emotion were exceptionally high. Modelling of predictors of negative emotions established several risk factors related to demographic variables, personal vulnerabilities, financial stresses, and social distancing experiences; particularly being young, being female, or having a mental illness diagnosis. The data provides important characterization of the current mental health of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critically, it appears that specific groups in the Australian community may need special attention to ensure their mental health is protected during these difficult times. The data further suggests the need for immediate action to combat high levels of psychological distress, along with the exacerbation of mental health conditions, in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. These results may provide some direction for international researchers hoping to characterize similar issues in other countries.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susan Rossell","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Erica Neill","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Phillipou","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Eric Tan","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Toh","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Tamsyn Van Rheenen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denny Meyer","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155457","rel_title":"Is population anxiety associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths?

Anxiety can be seen as a manifestation of a nocebo context. The psychological stress of the COVID-19 pandemic led some people to experience COVID-19 symptoms, which were not actually related to a COVID-19 infection. A fundamental goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is to limit the COVID-19 related demand on healthcare systems and to minimize COVID-19 related deaths. This exploratory study aims to determine to what extent the anxiety in the population is related to the number of covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths. METHODS We will quantify the magnitude of the relationship between population anxiety and hospitalizations \/ deaths. Anxiety will be assessed using the results of the most frequently used anxiety measuring scale. Official websites of governments will be screened to determine hospitalizations and deaths. Studies will be included if they had at least 100 respondents, used a validated anxiety scale, reported on the general population of a country, and were conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic. A search strategy will take into account the limited resources for this study and will be used to search Pubmed, MedRXiv and PsychRXiv. Screening will take place at two levels: abstracts and titles, followed by full text reports. One researcher will extract data which will be double checked by a second researcher. We will perform weighted OLS regression to quantify the relationship of anxiety and covid-19 related hospitalizations \/ deaths. DISCUSSION Covid-19 related measures can carry a significant social cost and risk of unwanted effects; it is therefore important to assess the extent to which anxiety in the population is related to covid-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. If anxiety can be properly reduced in the population, health care will be safeguarded. Thus, any strategy that reduces anxiety can then be included in evidence-based decision making.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederik Feys","author_inst":"Independent"},{"author_name":"Abdallah Naser","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University Jordan\/Amman"},{"author_name":"Andrea Phillipou","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Eric Tan","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Toh","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Tamsyn Van Rheenen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denny Meyer","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155515","rel_title":"Are countries precautionary actions against COVID-19 effective?

Numerous countries have attempted to employ precautions to address this pandemic. Objective This study was aimed at exploring and assessing the precautionary actions taken by 175 countries on six continents to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods An observational study was conducted based on data collected during the period from December 31, 2019, until the end of April 2020. Several data were extracted, including information related to the date of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, total confirmed cases, total active cases, and more. In addition, seven validated indicators were used to assess the countries preparedness and precautionary actions. Results A total of 175 countries were included in the study. The total COVID-19 infection rate increased exponentially and rapidly in North America and Europe from March to April. The application of the precautions (indicators) varied between countries. School closures, quarantines and curfews were the most applied indicators among all countries. As for the relationship between the indicators and their effects on the infection rate, Italy and Spain were the top countries in Europe and adopted all indicators. Nevertheless, they faced high infection rates: 239,639 and 205,463 COVID-19 cases in Spain, and Italy, respectively. Conclusion The precautionary actions might have played a role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in several countries. However, many countries did not benefit from applying these indicators.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Food and Drug Authority, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalidah Alenzi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fatemah Alnofal","author_inst":"Saudi Food and Drug Authority, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ghada Fradees","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Alqassim, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ali Altebainawi","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Ministry of Health, Hail, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Tamsyn Van Rheenen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denny Meyer","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155523","rel_title":"The impact of climate temperature on counts, recovery, and death rates due to SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa.","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155523","rel_abs":"The impact of climate temperature on the counts (number of positive COVID-19 cases reported), recovery, and death rates of COVID-19 cases in all of South Africa's 9 provinces was investigated.

Our result indicates that a higher or lower climate temperature does not prevent or delay the spread and death rates but shows significant positive impacts on the recovery rates of COVID-19 patients. Thus, it indicates that the climate temperature is unlikely to impose a strict limit on the spread of COVID-19. There is no correlation between the cases and death rates, an indicator that no particular temperature range is closely associated with a faster or slower death rate of COVID-19 patients.

Although international guidelines address the mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) response to emergencies, regional recommendations on COVID-19 are still insufficient. We identified emerging mental health problems, strategies to address them, and opportunities to reform mental health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to mental health decision-makers of Ministries of Health in 10 South American countries in mid-April 2020. The semi-structured questionnaire had 12 questions clustered into 3 main sections: emerging challenges in mental health, current and potential strategies to face the pandemic, and, key elements for mental health reform. We identified keywords and themes for each section through summative content analysis. Findings An increasing mental health burden and emerging needs are arising as direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic among health care providers and the general population. National lockdowns challenge the delivery and access to mental health treatment and care. Strategies to meet these health needs rely heavily on timely and adequate responses by strengthened mental health governance and systems, availability of services, virtual platforms, and appropriate capacity building for service providers. Short- and medium-term strategies focused on bolstering community-based mental health networks and telemedicine for high-risk populations. Opportunities for long-term mental health reform entail strengthening legal frameworks, redistribution of financial resources and collaboration with local and international partners. Interpretation Mental health and psychosocial support have been identified as a priority area by South American countries in the COVID-19 response. The pandemic has generated specific needs that require appropriate actions including: implementing virtual based interventions, orienting capacity building towards protection of users and health providers, strengthening evidence-driven decision making and integrating MHPSS in high-level mechanisms guiding the response to COVID-19.

Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets we can assess the relative contribution of aerosols in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total numbers and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing from healthy subjects. Dynamic modelling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows to account for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces.

The responses of specific immune cell populations to the disease remain poorly defined, which hinders improvements in treatment and care management. Here, we utilized mass cytometry (CyTOF) to thoroughly phenotype peripheral myeloid cells and T lymphocytes from 30 convalescent patients with mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19. We identified 10 clusters of monocytes and dendritic cells and 17 clusters of T cells. Examination of these clusters revealed that both CD14+CD16+ intermediate and CD14dimCD16+ nonclassical monocytes, as well as CD4+ stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells, correlated with COVID-19 severity, coagulation factor levels, and\/or inflammatory indicators. We also identified two nonclassical monocyte subsets distinguished by expression of the sugar residue 6-Sulfo LacNac (Slan). One of these subsets (Slanlo, nMo1) was depleted in moderately and severely ill patients, while the other (Slanhi, nMo2) increased with disease severity and was linked to CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cell frequencies, coagulation factors, and inflammatory indicators. Intermediate monocytes tightly correlated with loss of naive T cells as well as an increased abundance of effector memory T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our data suggest that both intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets shape the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study provides both broad and in-depth characterization of immune cell phenotypes in response to COVID-19 and suggests functional interactions between distinct cell types during the disease.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUse of mass cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients allows correlation of distinct monocyte and T lymphocyte subsets with clinical factors.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lindsey E.

VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229.

Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is a positive-strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells. From sequencing three isolates, we derive a robust identification of SARS-CoV-2 modification sites within a physiologically relevant host cell type. A comparison of our data with the DRS data from a previous SARS-CoV-2 isolate, both raised in monkey renal cells, reveals consistent RNA modifications across the viral genome. Conservation of the RNA modification pattern during progression of the current pandemic suggests that this pattern is likely essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and represents a possible target for drug interventions.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Milad Miladi","author_inst":"University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Fuchs","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Maier","author_inst":"University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Weigang","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Nuria Diaz i Pedrosa","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lisa Weiss","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Achim Lother","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Anton Nekrutenko","author_inst":"The Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Ruzsics","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Marcus Panning","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Georg Kochs","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Ralf Gilsbach","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Bjoern Andreas Gruening","author_inst":"University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Khanna","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.205088","rel_title":"A single intranasal dose of chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine confers sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.205088","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a global health priority.

Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, and curtailing pandemic spread.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed O Hassan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Natasha M Kafai","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Igor P Dmitriev","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Brittany Smith","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Ian B Harvey","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Emma S Winkler","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Alex W Wessel","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Elena Kashentseva","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Broc T McCune","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Adam L Bailey","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Zhao","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Laura A VanBlargan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Dai","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Meisheng Ma","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lucas J Adams","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yixuan J Hou","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Arthur S Kim","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Shamus P Keeler","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daniela Weiskopf","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael J Holtzman","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"David T Curiel","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.206847","rel_title":"Longitudinal analysis of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in convalescent plasma donors","rel_date":"2020-07-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.206847","rel_abs":"Hema-Quebec, the blood supplier in the Province of Quebec, Canada, collects and tests convalescent plasma used in a clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy of this product for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So far, we have collected 1159 plasma units from 282 COVID-19 convalescent donors. The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821). This suggests that de novo secretion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies by short-lived plasma cells stopped about 2-3 months after disease onset, an observation that has important implications for convalescent plasma collection and seroprevalence studies undertaken several months after the peak of infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9e Perreault","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Tony Tremblay","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Marie-Jos\u00e9e Fournier","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Drouin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussi\u00e8res","author_inst":"CRCHUM"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Pr\u00e9vost","author_inst":"CRCHUM \/ Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Antoine Lewin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Philippe B\u00e9gin","author_inst":"CHU Ste-Justine"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9s Finzi","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},{"author_name":"Ren\u00e9e Bazin","author_inst":"H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Elena Kashentseva","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Broc T McCune","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Adam L Bailey","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Zhao","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Laura A VanBlargan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Dai","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Meisheng Ma","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lucas J Adams","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yixuan J Hou","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Arthur S Kim","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Shamus P Keeler","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daniela Weiskopf","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael J Holtzman","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"David T Curiel","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.204339","rel_title":"Mutational dynamics and transmission properties of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in Austria","rel_date":"2020-07-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.204339","rel_abs":"Superspreading events shape the COVID-19 pandemic.

Capitalizing on a national epidemiological surveillance system, we performed deep whole-genome sequencing of virus isolates from 576 samples to cover major Austrian SARS-CoV-2 clusters. Our data chart a map of early viral spreading in Europe, including the path from low-frequency mutations to fixation. Detailed epidemiological surveys enabled us to calculate the effective SARS-CoV-2 population bottlenecks during transmission and unveil time-resolved intra-patient viral quasispecies dynamics.

Novel coronavirus or SARS-COV-2 strain is responsible for COVID-19 and it has already shown the deadly nature of respiratory disease by threatening the health of millions of lives across the globe. Clinical study reveals that a COVID-19 infected person may experience dry cough, muscle pain, headache, fever, sore throat and mild to moderate respiratory illness. At the same time, it affects the lungs badly with virus infection. So, the lung can be a prominent internal organ to diagnose the gravity of COVID-19 infection using X-Ray and CT scan images of chest. Despite having lengthy testing time, RT-PCR is a proven testing methodology to detect coronavirus infection. Sometimes, it might give more false positive and false negative results than the desired rates. Therefore, to assist the traditional RT-PCR methodology for accurate clinical diagnosis, COVID-19 screening can be adopted with X-Ray and CT scan images of lung of an individual. This image based diagnosis will bring radical change in detecting coronavirus infection in human body with ease and having zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. This paper reports a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-image augmentation technique for detecting COVID-19 in chest X-Ray and chest CT scan images of coronavirus suspected individuals. Multi-image augmentation makes use of discontinuity information obtained in the filtered images for increasing the number of effective examples for training the CNN model. With this approach, the proposed model exhibits higher classification accuracy around 95.38% and 98.97% for CT scan and X-Ray images respectively. CT scan images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 94.78% and specificity of 95.98%, whereas X-Ray images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 99.07% and specificity of 98.88%. Evaluation has been done on publicly available databases containing both chest X-Ray and CT scan images and the experimental results are also compared with ResNet-50 and VGG-16 models.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kiran Purohit","author_inst":"NIT Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Kesarwani","author_inst":"NIT Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Dakshina Ranjan Kisku","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Mamata Dalui","author_inst":"NIT Durgapur"},{"author_name":"Daniela Schmid","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Stephan W Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Benedikt Agerer","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Lercher","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukas Endler","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henrique Colaco","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mark Smyth","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michael Schuster","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.

Furthermore, with its increasing incidence, more has been learned about the risk factors that can make certain groups more at risk of contracting the disease or have worse outcomes. We aim to identify any discrepancy in the hospitalization rate by race\/ethnicity of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, and through this, analyze the risks of these groups in an effort to call out for attention to the circumstances that make them more vulnerable and susceptible to disease. Observations: Analysis indicates that patients identified as non-Hispanic White and Asian\/Pacific Islander in hospital admission data are underrepresented in COVID-19 admissions. Patients identified as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic\/Latino, and American Indian have a disproportionate burden of hospital admissions, suggesting an increased risk of more severe disease. Conclusions and Relevance: There is a disproportionate rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations found among non-Hispanic Blacks. Further investigation is imperative to identify and remediate the reason(s) for increased vulnerability to COVID-19 infections requiring hospital admission. These efforts would likely reduce the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the non-Hispanic Black population.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Violeta Alvarez Retamales","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield IL"},{"author_name":"Oswaldo Madrid Suarez","author_inst":"Universidad Central de Venezuela, Luis Razetti School of Medicine.

Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients. Methods Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28\/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF.

Using the per capita number of new cases as a proxy for the abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the number of deaths as a measure of virulence, the dynamics of the pandemic and the outcomes emerging from it are examined for three locations (England, Italy and New York State). The data are analysed with a new version of a population dynamics model that combines exponential\/logistic growth with time-varying carrying capacity, allowing predictions of persistence or extinction of the virus. In agreement with coevolutionary theory, the model suggests a transition from exponential virus growth to low abundance, coupled with reduced virulence, during colonisation of the alternate human host. The structure of the model allows a straightforward assessment of key parameters, which can be contrasted with standard epidemiological models and interpreted with respect to ecological and evolutionary processes and isolation policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Gillman","author_inst":"University of Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Nuno Crokidakis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Hai-Jun Deng","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-Zhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gui-Ji Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chang-Long He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lu-Yi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-Li Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.

Whether the normal development of gut-airway microbiome is affected by COVID-19 has not been evaluated. We demonstrate that COVID-19 alters the respiratory and gut microbiome of children. Alteration of the microbiome was divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, albeit the dysbiosis was dominated by genus Pseudomonas and sustained for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. The respiratory microbiome distortion persisted in 7\/8 children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital. The gut microbiota showed early dysbiosis towards later restoration in some children, but not others. Disturbed development of both gut and respiratory microbiomes, and prolonged respiratory dysbiosis in children imply possible long-term complications after clinical recovery from COVID-19, such as predisposition to an increased health risk in the post-COVID-19 era.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rong Xu","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Liu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Qunfu Wu","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Mei Zeng","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Ma","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Xia Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Jin Xu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Chiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.

COVID-19 seroprevalence data has been scarce, especially in less developed countries with a relatively low infection rate. METHODS. A locally developed rapid IgM\/IgG test kit was used for screening hospital staff in Ranong hospital which located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from April 17 to May 17, 2020. A total of 844 participants were tested; 82 of which were tested twice with one month apart. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) RESULTS. Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive immunoglobulin M (IgM), none had positive immunoglobulin G (IgG). Female staffs seemed to have higher IgM seropositive than male staffs (1.0% vs. 0.5%). None of the participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or a history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptom and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case, history of close contact with suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed IgG against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION. COVID-19 antibody test could detect a substantial number of hospital staffs who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 case. Antibody testing should be encouraged for mass screening, especially in asymptomatic healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanawin Nopsopon","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Krit Pongpirul","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Korn Chotirosniramit","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wutichai Jakaew","author_inst":"Ranong Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chuenkhwan Kaewwijit","author_inst":"Ranong Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sawan Kanchana","author_inst":"Ranong Hospital"},{"author_name":"Narin Hiransuthikul","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Xu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Chiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Grau","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Francisco Martinez Jimenez","author_inst":"IRB"},{"author_name":"Oriol Pich","author_inst":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Wegene Tamire Borena","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Medical University Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Erich Pawelka","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zsofia Keszei","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Senekowitsch","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jan Laine","author_inst":"CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberle","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mario Karolyi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV, Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sabine Maritschnik","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Martin Borkovec","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Peter Hufnagl","author_inst":"Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety"},{"author_name":"Manfred Nairz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Guenter Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Michael T.
