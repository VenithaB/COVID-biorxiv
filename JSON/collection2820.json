To date only studies in the UK on hospital deaths have been published in the peer reviewed literature. Legal requirements for cremation in England and Wales require the collection of information that can be used to improve understanding of Covid 19 deaths in both hospital and community settings. Aim: To document demographic and clinical characteristics, including likely place of infection, of individuals dying of Covid 19 to inform public health policy Design: A comprehensive case series of deaths from Covid 19 between 6 April and 30 May. Setting: A crematorium in South Wales Participants: Individuals for whom an application was made for cremation. Main outcome measures: Age, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities, where infection acquired. Results: Of 752 cremations, 215(28.6%) were Covid-19 of which 115 (53.5%) were male and 100 (46.5%) female. The median age was 82 years, with the youngest patient being 47 years and the oldest 103 years. Over half the deaths (121\/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.03 -3.74, p=0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of comorbidities. Only 21(9.8%) of 215 patients had no comorbidities recorded. Patients dying in nursing homes were significantly older than those dying in hospital(median 88y (IQ range 82-93y) v 80y (IQ range 71-87y): p<0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities than those dying in nursing homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 v. 1: IQ range 1-2: p <0.001). Conclusions: In a representative series, comprising both hospital and community deaths, persons over 80 with an average 2 comorbidities predominated. Although men and women were represented in similar proportions, men were more likely to die in hospital. Over half the infections were acquired in either hospitals or nursing and residential homes with implications for the management of the pandemic, historically and in the future.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roland L.

The analysis was based on the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) using lattice Boltzmann model (LBM). The result confirms that by modifying public space configuration in this case by providing more space and increasing seating distance can reduce the vulnerability towards droplet dispersions. Whereas, providing shield including adding protection is far more effective in avoiding dispersions. The public space reconfiguration including increasing seat distance and reducing seating capacity also has an effect in reducing the indoor CO2. Capacity reduction from full capacity to 30% can decrease the CO2 from 5722 to 2144 ppm.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrio Adwibowo","author_inst":"University of Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Stephen P.

We hypothesized that the overall stringency of a government's interventions and the speed of implementation would affect the growth and level of deaths related to COVID-19 in that country. Design: Observational study based on an original database of global governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily data was collected on a range of containment and closure policies for 170 countries from January 1, 2020 until May 27, 2020 by a team of researchers at Oxford University, UK. These data were combined into an aggregate stringency index (SI) score for each country on each day (range: 0-100). Regression was used to show correlations between the speed and strength of government stringency and deaths related to COVID-19 with a number of controls for time and country-specific demographic, health system, and economic characteristics. Interventions: Nine non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school and work closures, restrictions on international and domestic travel, public gathering bans, public information campaigns, as well as testing and contact tracing policies. Main outcomes measures: The primary outcome was deaths related to COVID-19, measured both in terms of maximum daily deaths and growth rate of daily deaths. Results: For each day of delay to reach an SI 40, the average daily growth rate in deaths was 0.087 percentage points higher (0.056 to 0.118, P<0.001). In turn, each additional point on the SI was associated with a 0.080 percentage point lower average daily growth rate (-0.121 to -0.039, P<.001). These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to SI 40 would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall. Conclusions: A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Hale","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Hale","author_inst":"Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Kira","author_inst":"Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna Petherick","author_inst":"Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Toby Phillips","author_inst":"Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Devi Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Thompson","author_inst":"Mathematics Institute, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samuel Webster","author_inst":"Not affiliated"},{"author_name":"Noam Angrist","author_inst":"Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144576","rel_title":"Foundational research and NIH funding enabling Emergency Use Authorization of remdesivir for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144576","rel_abs":"Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir months after discovery of COVID19 is unprecedented. Typically, decades of research and public sector funding are required to establish the mature body of foundational research requisite for efficient, targeted drug discovery and development. This work quantifies the body of research related to the biological target of remdesivir, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), or parent chemical structure, nucleoside analogs (NcAn), through 2019, as well as NIH funding for this research from 2000 to 2019. There were 6,567 RdRp related publications in PubMed, including 1,263 with NIH support, and 11,073 NcAn-related publications, including 2,319 with NIH support. NIH support for RdRp research comprised 2,203 Project Years with Costs of $1,875 million. NIH support for NcAn research comprised 4,607 Project Years with Costs of $4,612 million. Research Project grants accounted for 63% and 48% of Project Years for RdRp and NcAn respectively, but only 19% and 12% of Project Costs. Analytical modeling of research maturation estimates that RdRp and NcAn research passed an established maturity threshold in 2008 and 1994 respectively. Of 97 investigational compounds targeting RdRp since 1989, the three authorized for use entered clinical trials after both thresholds. This work demonstrates the scale of foundational research on the biological target and parent chemical structure of remdesivir that supported its discovery and development for COVID19. This work identifies $6.5 billion in NIH funding for research leading to remdesivir, underscoring the role of public sector investments in basic research and research infrastructure that underlie new drugs and the response to emergent disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ekaterina Galkina Cleary","author_inst":"Center for Integration of Science and Industry, Bentley University, Waltham MA 02452"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify the causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed\/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords 'COVID-19', 'smell', and\/or 'olfaction'. We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID%[minus]19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss - subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli - to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 45% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 31.1-58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mackenzie E Hannum","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Vicente A Ramirez","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah J Lipson","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Riley D Herriman","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Aurora K Toskala","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Cailu Lin","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Paule V Joseph","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Danielle R Reed","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Noam Angrist","author_inst":"Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20144758","rel_title":"Comparison of two commercial platforms and a laboratory developed test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20144758","rel_abs":"Mitigation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory diagnostic services. We evaluated the performance of one LDT and two commercial tests, cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag(R) COVID-19 (Mobidiag), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas(R) test (100%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement (NPA) was lowest for cobas(R) test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test (98.8%) and the highest value was obtained for LDT (100%). The dilution series conducted for specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas(R) assay in comparison with the other two assays and the low NPA value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and hands-on time per sample were shortest for cobas(R) test. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months in mitigation of the pandemic. To secure that, it is of critical importance for clinical laboratories to maintain several simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Mannonen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Hannimari Kallio-Kokko","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Anu Jaaskelainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Pia Jokela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Jenni Antikainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Paula Vare","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Eliisa Kekalainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Hanna Jarva","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Maija Lappalainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.04.20146027","rel_title":"Sample Pooling as an efficient strategy for SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR screening: a multicenter study in Spain","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.04.20146027","rel_abs":"Importance: The actual demand on SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is a current challenge for clinical laboratories. Sample pooling may help to ameliorate workload in clinical laboratories. Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of sample pooling compared to the individual analysis for the diagnosis of CoVID-19, by using different commercial platforms for nucleic acid extraction and amplification. Design and settings: observational, prospective, multicentre study across 9 Spanish clinical microbiology laboratories including SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing performed in April 2020, during the first three days after acceptance to participate. Participants and Methods: 3519 naso-oro-pharyngeal samples received at the participating laboratories were processed individually and in pools (351 pools) according to the existing methodology in each of the centres. Results: We found that 253 pools (2519 samples) were negative, and 99 pools (990 samples) were positive; with 241 positive samples (6.85%), our pooling strategy would have saved 2167 PCR tests. For 29 pools (made out of 290 samples) we found discordant results when compared to their correspondent individual samples: in 24\/29 pools (30 samples), minor discordances were found; for five pools (5 samples), we found major discordances. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for pooling were 97.93%, 100%, 100% and 99.85% respectively; accuracy was 99.86% and kappa concordant coefficient was 0.988. As a result of the sample dilution effect of pooling, a loss of 2-3 Cts was observed for E, N or RdRP genes. Conclusion: we show a high efficiency of pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, across different RNA extraction and amplification platforms, with excellent performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. We believe that our results may help clinical laboratories to respond to the actual demand and clinical need on SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially for the screening of low prevalence populations.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adolfo de Salazar","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology Unit.

Viasure RT-qPCR kit is a reliable tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis but improvement of an alternative RT-qPCR reaction for RNA extraction quality control as RNaseP is recommended.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byron Freire-Paspuel","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Patricio Alejandro Vega-Marino","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena  para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Alberto Velez","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Marilyn Cruz","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Franklin Perez","author_inst":"One Lab.

These four have a relationship with the shape of the daily mortality curve once one considers the intervals from infection to death or recovery. Without an understanding of this relationship we cannot say that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives. Using a small stochastic model, the lockdown had to be weakened, in April and May, for simulated deaths to match ongoing actual daily deaths. Google mobility data was found to be consistent with the weakening required in the model with similar changes from baseline in time and magnitude. If in an earlier lockdown, mobility and interactions would have followed a similar course, then with a large epidemic curve an earlier lockdown might be associated with many more deaths than some currently believe. This was confirmed in the stochastic model and in two modified SIR models of epidemics of various sizes. The first SIR model had a fixed period to recovery and the second used random periods, both models had random periods to death. Weakening of the mitigations was required to tune the output in large but not in small epidemics. This gives weight to the epidemic having affected many more individuals than some reports currently suggest. In both one and two-week earlier lockdowns, total deaths were found to depend on the size of the epidemic and to vary from 2,000-49,000 deaths. There was a linear relationship between the peak proportion of the population infected and the reciprocal of the case fatality rate. This work questions the low prevalence of < 0.1%, reported by the Office for National Statistics in May and June 2020, since to accommodate a weakening lockdown, the shape of the daily mortality curve, and an acceptable case fatality rate a much larger epidemic curve is required.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony D Lander","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patricio Alejandro Vega-Marino","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena  para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Alberto Velez","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Marilyn Cruz","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Franklin Perez","author_inst":"One Lab.

Model explainability techniques provide insightful data-driven narratives about COVID-19 death toll motion models $-$ while velocity is explained by factors that are increasing\/reducing death toll pace now, acceleration anticipates the effects of public health measures on slowing the death toll pace. This allows policymakers and epidemiologists to understand factors driving the outbreak and to evaluate the impacts of different public health measures. Finally, our models also predict counterfactuals in order to face the challenge of estimating what is likely to happen as a result of an action.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adriano Veloso","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Nivio Ziviani","author_inst":"Kunumi, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Alberto Velez","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Marilyn Cruz","author_inst":"Agencia de Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos"},{"author_name":"Franklin Perez","author_inst":"One Lab.

In the past, the effect of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus was studied for a very early phase of the data with mixed results. We are studying the impact of COVID-19 on the maximum temperature and relative humidity of a place using Indian states as test cases for SIR, SIRD, and SEIR models. We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between effective reproduction number with maximum temperature and relative humidity. Most of the states show a correlation with the negative slope between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and the relative humidity. It indicates that the effective reproduction number goes down as maximum temperature or relative humidity rise. But, the regression coefficient R2 is low for these correlations which means that the correlation is not strong.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manoj Mandal","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Subhradeep Patra","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Sabyasachi Pal","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Suman Acharya","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Mangal Hazra","author_inst":"Midnapore City College"},{"author_name":"Miguel Angel Garcia Bereguiain","author_inst":"Universidad de Las Americas"},{"author_name":"Subhajit Biswas","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Antonio Moreno","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology Unit.

The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in most cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples suggests the involvement of further mechanisms including autoimmunity. We therefore determined whether anti-neuronal or anti-glial autoantibodies are present in eleven consecutive severely ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. These included myoclonus, cranial nerve involvement, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures. Most patients showed signs of CSF inflammation and increased levels of neurofilament light chain. All patients had anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF when assessing a large panel of autoantibodies against intracellular and surface antigens relevant for central nervous system diseases using cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on murine brain sections. Antigens included proteins well-established in clinical routine, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also a variety of specific undetermined epitopes on brain sections. These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb. The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). While several underlying autoantigens still await identification in future studies, presence of autoantibodies may explain some aspects of multi-organ disease in COVID-19 and can guide immunotherapy in selected cases.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christiana Franke","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Caroline Ferse","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jakob Kreye","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Momsen Reincke","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Elisa Sanchez-Sendin","author_inst":"DZNE, Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rocco","author_inst":"Ernst-von-Bergmann Klinikum, Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mirja Steinbrenner","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Stefan Angermair","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Sascha Treskatsch","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Daniel Zickler","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Kai-Uwe Eckardt","author_inst":"Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been used for its treatment but their safety and efficacy remain uncertain. Objective: We performed a systematic review to synthesize the available data on the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: Two reviewers searched for published and pre-published relevant articles between December 2019 to 8th June 2020. The data from the selected studies were abstracted and analyzed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa scale. The quality of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach. Results: We reviewed 12 observational and 3 randomized trials which included 10659 patients of whom 5713 received CQ\/HCQ and 4966 received only standard of care. The efficacy of CQ\/HCQ for COVID-19 was inconsistent across the studies. Meta-analysis of included studies revealed no significant reduction in mortality with HCQ use [RR 0.98 95% CI 0.66-1.46] , time to fever resolution [mean difference -0.54 days (-1.19-011)] or clinical deterioration\/development of ARDS with HCQ [RR 0.90 95% CI 0.47-1.71]. There was a higher risk of ECG abnormalities\/arrhythmia with HCQ\/CQ [RR 1.46 95% CI 1.04 to 2.06]. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for these outcomes. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that CQ or HCQ does not improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed randomized trials are required for assessing the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunmozhimaran Elavarasi","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, India"},{"author_name":"Manya Prasad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Tulika Seth","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ranjit Kumar Sahoo","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Karan Madan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Nischal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Atul Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Subir Kumar Maulik","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

Our focus is on trajectories of daily reported COVID-19 cases, rather than cumulative cases, as trajectories help us identify trends in how the pandemic naturally develops over time, and study the shapes of the curve in different states. Methods: We analyzed data on daily reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from January 21 to June 16, 2020 in 50 states, adjusted for the population size of each state. Cluster analysis for time-series data was used to split the states into clusters that have distinct trajectories of daily cases. Differences in socio-demographic characteristics and healthcare access between clusters were tested. Adjusted models were used to determine if healthcare access is associated with reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Results: Two clusters of states were identified. One cluster had a high trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases, and comprised of 19 states, including New York and New Jersey. The other cluster of states (n=31) had a low trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases. There were significantly more Black residents (p=0.027) and more nursing facility residents (p=0.001) in states reporting high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. States reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases also had fewer uninsured persons (p=0.005), fewer persons who reported having to forgo medical care due to cost (p=0.016), more registered physicians (p=0.002) and more nurses (p=0.03), higher health spending per capita (p=0.01), fewer residents in Health Professional Shortage Areas per 100,000 population (p=0.027), and higher adoption of Medicaid Expansion (p=0.05). In adjusted models, a higher proportion of uninsured persons (OR: 0.51 [0.25-0.85]; p=0.032), higher proportion of patients who had to forgo medical care due to cost (OR: 0.55 [0.28-0.95]; p=0.048), and no adoption of Medicaid expansion (OR: 0.05 [0-0.59]; p=0.04), were associated with reporting a low trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Our findings from adjusted models suggest that healthcare access can partially explain variations in COVID-19 case trajectories by state.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shelley H.

In existing split-ventilator configurations using FDA-approved tubing adaptors, each patient receives the same inspiratory pressure, requiring careful matching of patients to avoid barotrauma. Progression of disease may cause tidal volumes to diverge from desired targets, and routine interventions (eg. suctioning) in one patient may adversely affect other patients. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrate a split-ventilator configuration that enables individualized patient management by incorporating a commonly available pressure regulator used for gas appliances. We validate this method by achieving various combinations of tidal volume in each of two synthetic lungs using a standard ventilator machine in combination with two gas flow analyzers. With further safety testing and instrumentation, pressure regulators may represent a viable path to substantially augment the capacity for ventilation in resource-constrained settings.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lakshminarayan Srinivasan","author_inst":"Transcend Review, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chris A Rishel","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Barrett J.

Only small areas in their 'Vitamin D winter' (monthly mean UVvitd of under 165 KJ\/m2) from Jan to April 2020. Participants The 'at-risk' population is the total small area population, with measures to incorporate spatial infection into the model. The model is adjusted for potential confounders including long-term winter temperature and humidity. Main outcome measures We derive UVA measures for each area from remote sensed data and estimate their relationship with COVID-19 mortality with a random effect for States, in a multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial model. In the USA and England death certificates had to record COVID-19. In Italy excess deaths in 2020 over expected from 2015-19. Data sources Satellite derived mean daily UVA dataset from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Data on deaths compiled by Center for Disease Control (USA), Office for National Statistics (England) and Italian Institute of Statistics. Results Daily mean UVA (January-April 2020) varied between 450 to 1,000 KJ\/m2 across the three countries. Our fully adjusted model showed an inverse correlation between UVA and COVID-19 mortality with a Mortality Risk Ratio (MRR) of 0.71 (0.60 to 0.85) per 100KJ\/m2 increase UVA in the USA, 0.81 (0.71 to 0.93) in Italy and 0.49 (0.38 to 0.64) in England. Pooled MRR was 0.68 (0.52 to 0.88). Conclusions Our analysis, replicated in 3 independent national datasets, suggests ambient UVA exposure is associated with lower COVID-19 specific mortality. This effect is independent of vitamin D, as it occurred at irradiances below that likely to induce significant cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis. Causal interpretations must be made cautiously in observational studies. Nonetheless this study suggests strategies for reduction of COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Cherrie","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Tom Clemens","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Claudio Colandrea","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Feng","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Webb","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Chris Dibben","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Richard B Weller","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Atul Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Subir Kumar Maulik","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed LC-MS\/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motives on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein.

Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1-3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 104 plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raveen Rathnasinghe","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shirin Strohmeier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Virginia L Gillespie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Schotsaert","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lynda Coughlan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sina"},{"author_name":"Melissa B Uccellini","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

A high-throughput assay based on differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was therefore optimized and used to identify possible Mac1 ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds. Numerous promising compounds included nucleotides, steroids, beta-lactams, and benzimidazoles. The main drawback to this approach was that a high percentage of compounds in some libraries were found to influence the observed Mac1 melting temperature. To prioritize DSF screening hits, the shapes of the observed melting curves and initial assay fluorescence were examined, and the results were compared with virtual screens performed using Autodock VINA. The molecular basis for alternate ligand binding was also examined by determining a structure of one of the hits, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, with atomic resolution.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajdeep S Virdi","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Robert V Bavisotto","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C Hopper","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Nemanja Vuksanovic","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Trevor R Melkonian","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Nicholas R Silvaggi","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"David Frick","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Lynda Coughlan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sina"},{"author_name":"Melissa B Uccellini","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3\u2019-untranslated region (UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3\u2019-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on predicted, yet extensive, complementary base-pairings and similar interactions involving the Influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3\u2019-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection, and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3\u2019-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agnes P Chan","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ"},{"author_name":"Yongwook Choi","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Schork","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ; Departments of Population Sciences and Molecular and Cell Biology, The City of Hope National "},{"author_name":"Nemanja Vuksanovic","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Trevor R Melkonian","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Nicholas R Silvaggi","author_inst":"The University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"David Frick","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Lynda Coughlan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sina"},{"author_name":"Melissa B Uccellini","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shalimar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pramod Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rick Dersch","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Hosp","author_inst":"University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinrich J.

There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic\/effective concentration) of &gt;600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xia Xiao","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Conghui Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"De Chang","author_inst":"Third Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100039, P.

Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. It is speculated that along with ACE2, other auxiliary proteins (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells. We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs. Here, we demonstrated an extensive RNA and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues. We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients. The receptors\u2019 expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. In clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Satyendra C Tripathi","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Vishwajit Deshmukh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Nagpur"},{"author_name":"Chad J.

In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LOD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LOD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University"},{"author_name":"Xinming Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yingying Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ying Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Geng Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jianguo Li Sr.","author_inst":"Shanxi University"},{"author_name":"Charles S Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA"},{"author_name":"Lokesh Sharma","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Lei","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Kugelman","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Brett F Beitzel","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Gibson","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sara C Johnston","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Minogue","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Natalia Chueca","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology Unit.

We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process \u2018Entry into host cell\u2019, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

In particular, two signatures are likely ruled by APOBEC and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which induce hypermutation in a significant number of samples, and appear to be affected by severe purifying selection.Conversely, several mutations linked to low-rate mutational processes appear to transit to clonality in the population, eventually leading to the definition of new viral genotypes and to an increase of overall genomic diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that a high number of variants are observed in samples associated to independent lineages, likely due to signature-related mutational hotspots or to positive selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Graudenzi","author_inst":"Inst. of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IBFM-CNR), Segrate, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Maspero","author_inst":"Dept. of Informatics, Systems and Communication, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Angaroni","author_inst":"Dept. of Informatics, Systems and Communication, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rocco Piazza","author_inst":"Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Ramazzotti","author_inst":"Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Pulmonary Diseases, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"David Nickle","author_inst":"Merck Research Laboratories, Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Boston, Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New "},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Kugelman","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Brett F Beitzel","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Gibson","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sara C Johnston","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Minogue","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Natalia Chueca","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology Unit.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we analyze publicly available genomic datasets to systematically dissect the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed a functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock-treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed enrichment for immune response, cytokine-mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed the enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs, and HNRNPs suggesting the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. A similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed functionally important miRs that were highly expressed in immune cells, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to the progression of the viral infection and modulate host immune response across other human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key post-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic computational analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajneesh Srivastava","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Swapna Vidhur Daulatabad","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Mansi Srivastava","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Sarath Chandra Janga","author_inst":"Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)"},{"author_name":"Daniele Ramazzotti","author_inst":"Dept. of Medicine and Surgery, Univ. of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Canada"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Pulmonary Diseases, Groningen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"David Nickle","author_inst":"Merck Research Laboratories, Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Boston, Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New "},{"author_name":"Don D Sin","author_inst":"Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of System Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 10"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Kugelman","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Brett F Beitzel","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Gibson","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sara C Johnston","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Minogue","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Natalia Chueca","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology Unit.
