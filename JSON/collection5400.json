This study was aimed at describing clinical characteristics and outcomes of admitted patients with mild COVID-19 illness in the initial phase of pandemic in India. Design - Retrospective (observational ) study. Setting - COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi, where, isolation facilities were designed to manage patients with mild illness and dedicated COVID ICUs was created to cater patients with moderate to severe illness. Participants - Patients aged 18 years or more, with confirmed illness were eligible for enrolment. Patients who were either asymptomatic or mildly ill at presentation were included. Patients with moderate to severe illness at admission, or incomplete clinical symptomatology records were excluded. Methods - Data regarding demographic profile, comorbidities, clinical features, hospital course, treatment, details of results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 done at baseline and at day 14, chest radiographs (wherever available) as well as laboratory parameters was obtained retrospectively from the hospital records. Main outcome measures - Final outcome was noted in terms of course of the disease, patients discharged, still admitted (at time of conclusion of study) or death. Results -Out of 231 cases included, majority were males(78.3%) with a mean age of 39.8 years. Comorbidities were present in 21.2% of patients, diabetes mellitus and hypertension being most common. The most common symptoms were dry cough(81, 35%), fever(64, 27.7%), sore throat(36, 15.6%), and dyspnoea(24, 10.4%); asymptomatic infection was noted in 108(46.8%) patients. Presence of comorbidities was an independent predictor of symptomatic disease (OR-2.66; 95% CI 1.8 to 6.53, p= 0.03). None of the patients progressed to moderate to severe COVID-19. There were no deaths in this cohort. Conclusions - Patients with mild disease at presentation had a stable disease course and therefore such cases can be managed outside hospital setting. A large proportion of patients remained asymptomatic throughout the course of infection and those with comorbidities are more likely to be symptomatic.

An important factor compounding spread is the infection of medical staff with SARS-CoV-2, which threatens the collapse of the very institutions required to treat COVID-19. The possibility of virus transmission from patients with COVID-19 to medical staff is thus of primary concern. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriage among hospital staff could also be conceivable to act as a potent source of ongoing transmission. Here we show that, surprisingly, none of the medical staff working at a hospital with COVID-19 patients had IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, indicating that virus transmission from patients to medical staff did not occur in these medical workers. These results show that standard preventive measures against infectious diseases can prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure in medical staff, and should greatly encourage medical practitioners at the front line of this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tatsuya Nagano","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jun Arii","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mitsuhiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naofumi Yoshida","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keiji Iida","author_inst":"Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasuko Mori","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishkarsh Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Brajesh Ratre","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Balbir Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bhopale","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pavan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ankit Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Randeep Guleria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20107425","rel_title":"A Modelling Analysis of Strategies for Relaxing COVID-19 Social Distancing","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20107425","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: The ability of countries to contain and control COVID-19 virus transmission via social distancing is critical in the absence of a vaccine. Early activation of robust measures has been shown to control the daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. As countries begin to control COVID-19 spread an understanding of how to ease social distancing measures to prevent a rebound in cases and deaths is required. Methods: Using COVID-19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual-based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia. Simulation of virus transmission in this model, with and without, social distancing measures activated permitted us to quantify social distancing effectiveness. Optimal strategies for relaxing social distancing were determined under two settings: with high numbers of daily cases, as in New York; and where early social distancing activation resulted in limited ongoing transmission, as in Perth, Australia. Findings: In countries where strong social distancing measures were activated after the COVID-19 virus had spread widely, our study found these measures are required to be maintained for significant periods before being eased, to return to a situation where daily case numbers become low. In countries where early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been highly successful, as in Australia, we show that a staged relaxation of social distancing prevents a rebound in cases. Interpretation: Modelling studies and direct observation have shown that robust and timely social distancing have the most effect in containing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society and economic activity. This study demonstrates the necessity of holding robust social distancing in place until COVID-19 virus transmission has significantly decreased, and how they may then be safely eased.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George J Milne","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Simon Xie","author_inst":"the University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Dana Poklepovich","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Naofumi Yoshida","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keiji Iida","author_inst":"Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasuko Mori","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishkarsh Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Brajesh Ratre","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Balbir Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bhopale","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pavan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ankit Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Randeep Guleria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20107573","rel_title":"Modelling information-dependent social behaviors in response to lockdowns: the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20107573","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic started in January 2020 has not only threatened world public health, but severely impacted almost every facet of lives including behavioral and psychological aspects.

We consider a SEIR-like epidemic model where that contact and quarantine rates are assumed to depend on the available information and rumors about the disease status in the community. The model is applied to the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. We consider the period that stretches between February 24, 2020 when the first bulletin by the Italian Civil Protection was reported and May 18, 2020 when the lockdown restrictions have been mostly removed. The role played by the information-related parameters is determined by evaluating how they affect suitable outbreak-severity indicators. We estimated that citizens compliance with mitigation measures played a decisive role in curbing the epidemic curve by preventing a duplication of deaths and about 46% more contagions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bruno Buonomo","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Rossella Della Marca","author_inst":"University of Parma"},{"author_name":"Dana Poklepovich","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Naofumi Yoshida","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keiji Iida","author_inst":"Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Nishimura","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasuko Mori","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Komal Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishkarsh Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Garg","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Brajesh Ratre","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Balbir Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shweta Bhopale","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pavan Tiwari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ankit Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Randeep Guleria","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20107409","rel_title":"A pattern categorization of CT findings to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20107409","rel_abs":"Purpose As global healthcare system is overwhelmed by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), early identification of risks of adverse outcomes becomes the key to optimize management and improve survival. This study aimed to provide a CT-based pattern categorization to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods 165 patients with COVID-19 (91 men, 4-89 years) underwent chest CT were retrospectively enrolled. CT findings were categorized as Pattern0 (negative), Pattern1 (bronchopneumonia), Pattern2 (organizing pneumonia), Pattern3 (progressive organizing pneumonia) and Pattern4 (diffuse alveolar damage). Clinical findings were compared across different categories. Time-dependent progression of CT patterns and correlations with clinical outcomes, i.e. discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU, requiring mechanical ventilation, or death), with pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed. Results Of 94 patients with outcome, 81(86.2%) were discharged, 3(3.2%) were admitted to ICU, 4(4.3%) required mechanical ventilation, 6(6.4%) died. 31(38.3%) had complete absorption at median day 37 after symptom-onset. Significant differences between pattern-categories were found in age, disease-severity, comorbidity and laboratory results (all P<0.05). Remarkable evolution was observed in Pattern0-2 and Pattern3-4 within 3 and 2 weeks after symptom-onset, respectively; most of patterns remained thereafter. After controlling for age, CT pattern significantly correlated with adverse outcomes (Pattern4 vs. Pattern0-3 [reference]; hazard-ratio[95%CI], 18.90[1.91-186.60], P=0.012). CT pattern (Pattern3-4 vs. Pattern0-2 [reference]; 0.26[0.08-0.88], P=0.030) and C-reactive protein (>10 vs. [&le;]10mg\/L [reference]; 0.31[0.13-0.72], P=0.006) were risk-factors associated with pulmonary residuals. Conclusion CT pattern categorization allied with clinical characteristics within 2 weeks after symptom-onset would facilitate early prognostic stratification in COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chao Jin","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Carol C.

Combined with the absence of symptoms and humoral response across that group, this finding suggests that some individuals might be protected by T-cell cross-reactivity. In convalescent patients we observed public and diverse T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing T-cell receptor motifs with germline- encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to Spike glycoprotein were mediated by groups of homologous T-cell receptors, some of them shared across multiple donors.

To this end, we propose a control scheme that aims to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid diverse adverse effects. Exploiting the fact that the severity of the disease increases considerably with age, the proposed control scheme protects high-risk individuals that mainly consist of the elderly. The protection of high-risk individuals reduces the average severity of the disease in the unprotected population, thereby substantially reducing mortality and avoiding the collapse of the healthcare system. Social acceptability (in terms of the resulting mortality) and feasibility (in terms of the healthcare system capacity) of the proposed herd immunity strategy are summarized into two respective, easily computable conditions by building on a simple susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) model. For its parsimony, the proposed framework can provide a rule of thumb that applies to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the considered control scheme if R0 [&le;] 2.0 and the severity rates of the disease are 1\/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takashi Akamatsu","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Nagae","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Minoru Osawa","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Koki Satsukawa","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Takara Sakai","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Daijiro Mizutani","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Iuliia O Peshkova","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Khmelevskaya","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Dmitry V Dianov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Maria Malasheva","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Anton Shmelev","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Yana Serdyuk","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Dmitry V Bagaev","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Pivnyuk","author_inst":"Center of Life Sciences, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dmitrii S Shcherbinin","author_inst":"Pirogov Russian Medical State University, Moscow, Russia; Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexandra V Maleeva","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Naina T Shakirova","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Artem Pilunov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Dmitry B Malko","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Ekaterina G Khamaganova","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Bella Biderman","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Alexander V Ivanov","author_inst":"Center for Precision Genome Editing and Genetic Technologies for Biomedicine, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Ru"},{"author_name":"Mikhail Shugay","author_inst":"Center of Life Sciences, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Pirogov Russian Medical State University, Moscow, Russia; Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Insti"},{"author_name":"Grigory A Efimov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20107482","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and neutralizing activity in donor and patient blood from the San Francisco Bay Area","rel_date":"2020-05-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20107482","rel_abs":"We report very low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in two San Francisco Bay Area populations.

Neutralizing antibodies rise in tandem with immunoglobulin levels following symptom onset, exhibiting median time to seroconversion within one day of each other, and there is >93% positive percent agreement between detection of immunoglobulin-G and neutralizing titers.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dianna Ng","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Gregory Goldgof","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian Shy","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Andrew Levine","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joanna Balcerek","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sagar P Bapat","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John Prostko","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Kelly Coller","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Sandra Pearce","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Sergej Franz","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Li Du","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Satish Pillai","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alicia Sotomayor-Gonzalez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Venice Servellita","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sanchez-San Martin","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Andrea Granados","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Dustin R Glasner","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Lucy M Han","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kent Truong","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Naomi Akagi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"David N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Neil Neumann","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Qazi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yale A Santos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Green","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Phillip Williamson","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Nancy K Hills","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chuanyi M Lu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

High quality serology is a key tool to understanding the spread of infection, immunity against the virus, and correlates of protection. Limited validation and testing of serology assays used for serosurveys can lead to unreliable or misleading data, and clinical testing using such unvalidated assays can lead to medically costly diagnostic errors and improperly informed public health decisions. Estimating prevalence and clinical decision making is highly dependent on specificity. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol from antigen production to data analysis. This protocol defines thresholds for IgG and IgM for determination of seropositivity with estimated specificity well above 99%. Validation was performed using both traditionally collected serum and dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits, using archival (pre-2019) negative controls and known PCR-diagnosed positive patient controls. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses and no cross reactivity was observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI titer during validation. This strategy is highly specific and is designed to provide good estimates of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a population, providing specific and reliable data from serosurveys and clinical testing which can be used to better evaluate and understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity and correlates of protection.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carleen Klumpp-Thomas","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Heather Kalish","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Drew","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Sally Hunsberger","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Kelly Snead","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Michael P Fay","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Mehalko","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Anandakumar Shunmugavel","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Wall","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Peter Frank","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"John-Paul Denson","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Min Hong","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Gulcin Gulten","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Simon Messing","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Sam Michael","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"William Gilette","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Memoli","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Naomi Akagi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"David N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Neil Neumann","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Qazi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yale A Santos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Green","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Phillip Williamson","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Nancy K Hills","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chuanyi M Lu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

There have been no specific antiviral medications for SARS-CoV-2 while vaccines are still under development. Thus, rapid diagnosis and necessary public health measures are currently key parts to contain the pandemic. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, this method is not suitable for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis because of the timeconsuming procedure, the requirements of biosafety conditions and expensive equipment. In this study, the colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), cross-priming amplification (CPA), and polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) were developed and compared. The three methods exhibited similar performance with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as just 1 copy per reaction when evaluated on the synthetic DNA fragments. The results can be read with naked eyes within 30 minutes without crossreactivity to closely related coronaviruses. When tested with SARS-CoV-2 extracted genomic-RNA, LAMP outperformed both CPA and PSR assays. Moreover, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in simulated patient samples (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs) by colorimetric iNAATs was also successful. Further preparation of the lyophilized reagents for LAMP reactions revealed that the freeze-dried, ready-to-use kit maintained the sensitivity and LOD value of the liquid assays. These results strongly indicate that the colorimetric lyophilized LAMP test kit developed herein is highly suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 at POC.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diem Hong Tran","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Quoc Cuong Hoang","author_inst":"Directorial Board, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hau Thi Tran","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Uyen Phuong Le","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hoang Dang Khoa Do","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Minh Bui","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Duc Hai Nguyen","author_inst":"Planning Division, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thuy Linh Hoang","author_inst":"Medical Analysis Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thi Thanh Thao Nguyen","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hoang Anh Nguyen","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Trung Hieu Nguyen","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Minh Thang Cao","author_inst":"Microbiology and Immunology Department, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Van Van Vu","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Huong Thi Thu Phung","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Sam Michael","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"William Gilette","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Memoli","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Naomi Akagi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"David N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Neil Neumann","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Qazi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yale A Santos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Green","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Phillip Williamson","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Nancy K Hills","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chuanyi M Lu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

The PCR-based test, however, shows limited sensitivity, especially at early and late stages of the disease development [2,3], and is relatively time consuming. Fast and reliable complementary methods for detecting the viral infection would be of help in the current pandemia conditions. Mass-spectrometry is one of such possibilities. We have developed a mass-spectrometry based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs, based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid N protein. The N protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus, the most abundant protein in the virion, is the best candidate for mass-spectrometric detection of the infection, and MS-based detection of several peptides from the SARS-COoV-2 nucleoprotein has been reported earlier by the Sinz group [4]. Our approach shows confident identification of the N protein in patient samples even with the lowest viral loads and a much simpler preparation procedure. Our main protocol consists of virus inactivation by heating and adding of isopropanol, and tryptic digestion of the proteins sedimented from the swabs followed by MS analysis. A set of unique peptides, produced as a result of proteolysis of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, is detected. The obtained results can further be used to create fast parallel mass-spectrometric approaches for the detection of the virus in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, saliva, sputum and other physiological fluids.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evgeny (Eugene) N Nikolaev","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Maria I Indeykina","author_inst":"Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Brzhozovskiy","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Anna E Bugrova","author_inst":"Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexey Kononikhin","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Natalia L Starodubtseva","author_inst":"V.

Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing\/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data.\n\nResultshCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of [~]2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires less than 20mn on our cluster. Moreover, COVID-Align provides summary statistics, which can be used to determine the sequencing quality and evolutionary novelty of input genomes (e.g. number of new mutations and indels).\n\nAvailabilityhttps:\/\/covalign.pasteur.cloud, hub.docker.com\/r\/evolbioinfo\/covid-align\n\nContactsolivier.gascuel@pasteur.fr, frederic.lemoine@pasteur.fr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederic Lemoine","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Luc Blassel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jakub Voznica","author_inst":"Insitut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Gascuel","author_inst":"CNRS & Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Alexey Kononikhin","author_inst":"Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Natalia L Starodubtseva","author_inst":"V.

The true risk of a COVID-19 resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown. Objective: To quantify the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission in business establishments by building a risk index for each business that measures transmission risk over time. Design: This retrospective case series study uses anonymized cell phone GPS data to analyze trends in traffic patterns to businesses that may be potentially high-risk from January 2020 to June 2020. Setting: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, New York, and California. Participants: 1,272,260 businesses within 8 states from January 2020 - June 2020. Exposure(s): We monitored business traffic before the pandemic, during the pandemic and after early phases of reopening in 8 states. Main Outcome: Our primary outcome is our business risk index. The index was built using two metrics: visitors per square foot and the average duration of visits. Visitors per square foot account for how densely visitors are packed into businesses. The average duration of visits accounts for the length of time visitors are spending in a business. Results: Potentially risky traffic behaviors at businesses decreased by 30% by April. Since the end of April, the risk index has been increasing as states reopen. On average, it has increased between 10 to 20 percentage points since April and is moving towards pre-pandemic levels of traffic. There are some notable differences in trends across states and industries. Conclusion: Our risk index provides a way for policymakers and hospital decision makers to monitor the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from businesses based on the frequency and density of visits to businesses. Traffic is slowly moving towards pre-pandemic levels. This can serve as an important metric as states monitor and evaluate their reopening strategies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashley L O'Donoghue","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tenzin Dechen","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Whitney Pavlova","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Boals","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Garba Moussa","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Manvi Madan","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Aalok Thakkar","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Frank J DeFalco","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.

We estimate the average length of stay from hospitalization data at state level, and calculate the hospitalized rate at both state and county level. Then we develop two medical resource deficiency indices that measure the local medical burden based on the number of accumulated active confirmed cases normalized by local maximum potential medical resources, and the number of hospitalized patients that can be supported per ICU beds per critical care staff, respectively. The medical resources data, and the two medical resource deficiency indices are illustrated in a dynamic spatiotemporal visualization platform based on ArcGIS Pro Dashboards.

Knowledge of this virus is evolving, definitive care is not yet known, and mortality is increasing. We assessed its initial impact on paediatric surgical practice in Nigeria, creating a benchmark for recommendations and future reference. Methods Survey of 120 paediatric surgeons from 50 centres to assess socio-demographics and specific domains of impact of COVID-19 on their services and training in Nigeria. Seventy four surgeons adequately responded. Responses have been analysed. Duplicate submissions for centres were excluded by combining and averaging the responses from centres with multiple respondents. Results Forty-six (92%) centres had suspended elective surgeries. All centres continued emergency surgeries but volume reduced in March by 31%. Eleven (22%) centres reported 13 suspended elective cases presenting as emergencies in March, accounting for 3% of total emergency surgeries. Nine (18%) centres adopted new modalities for managing selected surgical conditions: non-operative reduction of intussusception in 1(2%), antibiotic management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in 5(10%), more conservative management of trauma and replacement of laparoscopic appendectomy with open surgery in 3(6%) respectively. Low perception of adequacy of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was reported in 35(70%) centres. Forty (80%) centres did not offer telemedicine for patients follow up. Twenty-nine (58%) centres had suspended academic training. Perception of safety to operate was low in 37(50%) respondents, indifferent in 24% and high in 26%. Conclusion Majority of paediatric surgical centres reported cessation of elective surgeries whilst continuing emergencies. There is however an acute decline in the volume of emergency surgeries. Adequate PPE need to be provided and preparations towards handling backlog of elective surgeries once the pandemic recedes. Further study is planned to more conclusively understand the full impact of this pandemic on children's surgery. Key words pandemic, COVID-19, children's surgery.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ibukunolu O Ogundele","author_inst":"OOUTH, SAGAMU"},{"author_name":"Felix M Alakaloko","author_inst":"LUTH, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Collins C Nwokoro","author_inst":"OOUTH, Sagamu"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel A Ameh","author_inst":"NHA, Abuja FCT"},{"author_name":"Shiyang Ruan","author_inst":"Department of Geography and GeoInformation Science, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Tian","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Yuyang Tian","author_inst":"Mercy Clinic Family Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chaowei Yang","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.

To address these issues, we introduce a Bayesian approach to the SIR model with correction for under-reporting in the analysis of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The proposed model was enforced to obtain estimates of important quantities such as the reproductive rate and the average infection period, along with the more likely date when the pandemic peak may occur.

Although models for the evaporation and trajectory of respiratory droplets have been developed, how the environment impacts the transmission of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the propagation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles generated by speech under a wide range of temperature (0 degree Celsius to 40 degree Celsius) and relative humidity (0% to 92%) conditions. We show that droplets can travel three times farther in low temperature and high humidity environment, while the amount of aerosol increases in high temperature and low humidity environment. The results also underscore the importance of proper ventilation, as droplets and aerosol spread significantly farther in airstreams. This study contributes to the understanding of the environmental impact on COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Qi","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yangying Zhu","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Cor Jesus Fernandes Fontes","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso"},{"author_name":"Yuyang Tian","author_inst":"Mercy Clinic Family Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chaowei Yang","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.

The current gold standard method of testing for COVID-19 is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The RT-PCR test, however, has an imperfect sensitivity (around 70%), is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and is in short supply, particularly in resource-limited countries. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as chest X-ray and Computed Tomography, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial as an alternative diagnostic tool. We develop a novel hierarchical attention neural network model to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). We refer to this model as Artificial Intelligence for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependency of features and improves model performance while the attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. Using a publicly available dataset of 5801 chest images, we demonstrate that our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 97.8%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.3%, a specificity of 99.98%, and a positive predictive value of 99.6% in detecting COVID-19 from chest radiography images. AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19 and prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam Zokaeinikoo","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Pooyan Kazemian","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Prasenjit Mitra","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Soundar Kumara","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Yangying Zhu","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Cor Jesus Fernandes Fontes","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso"},{"author_name":"Yuyang Tian","author_inst":"Mercy Clinic Family Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chaowei Yang","author_inst":"NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center, George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer P Stevens","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gennady T Sukhikh","author_inst":"V.

It presents with a highly variable disease course ranging from a large proportion of asymptomatic cases to severe respiratory failure in 17-29% of cases even in the absence of apparent comorbidities 1, 2. This implies a diverse host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The immunological characteristics underlying these divergent disease courses, however, still remain elusive. While insights into abrogations of innate immunity begin to emerge, adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 are poorly investigated, although they serve as immune signatures of protection and vaccine responses. We therefore set out to characterize immune signatures of convalescent COVID-19 patients stratified according to their disease severity. Methods: We performed high-dimensional flow cytometric profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent COVID-19 patients who we stratified according to their disease severity by a physician-assisted questionnaire based assessment of COVID-19 symptoms. Results: Surprisingly, we did not observe any difference in the relative proportions of any major immune cell type in convalescent patients presenting with different severity of COVID-19 disease except for a reduction in monocytes. The frequency of Tnaive T cells was significantly reduced in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas other T cell differentiations states (TCM, TEM, TEMRA) remained relatively unaffected by COVID-19 severity as assessed approximately two weeks after infection. Conclusions In our COVID-19 patient cohort, which is characterized by absence of comorbidities and therapeutic interventions other than symptomatic antipyretics, the immunophenotype is similar irrespective of a highly variable disease severity. Convalescence is therefore associated with a rather uniform immune signature. Abrogations, which were previously identified in the innate and adaptive immune compartment of COVID-19 patients should be scrutinized for direct associations with a preconditioned immune system shaped and made vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 by preexisting comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chang-Feng Chu","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Florian Sabath","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Shan Sun","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Ying-Yin Chao","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Christina E.

At the current stage of COVID-19 pandemic, forecasts become particularly important regarding the possibility that the total incidence could reach the level where the disease stops spreading because a considerable portion of the population has become immune and collective immunity could be reached. Such forecasts are valuable because the currently undertaken restrictive measures prevent mass morbidity but do not result in the development of a robust collective immunity. Thus, in the absence of efficient vaccines and medical treatments, lifting restrictive measures carries the risk that a second wave of the epidemic could occur. Methods. We developed a heterogeneous model of COVID-19 dynamics. The model accounted for the differences in the infection risk across subpopulations, particularly the age-depended susceptibility to the disease. Based on this model, an equation for the minimal number of infections was calculated as a condition for the epidemic to start declining. The basic reproductive number of 2.5 was used for the disease spread without restrictions. The model was applied to COVID-19 data from Italy. Findings. We found that the heterogeneous model of epidemic dynamics yielded a lower proportion, compared to a homogeneous model, for the minimal incidence needed for the epidemic to stop. When applied to the data for Italy, the model yielded a more optimistic assessment of the minimum total incidence needed to reach collective immunity: 43% versus 60% estimated with a homogeneous model. Interpretation. Because of the high heterogeneity of COVID-19 infection risk across the different age groups, with a higher susceptibility for the elderly, homogeneous models overestimate the level of collective immunity needed for the disease to stop spreading. This inaccuracy can be corrected by the homogeneous model introduced here. To improve the estimate even further additional factors should be considered that contribute to heterogeneity, including social and professional activity, gender and individual resistance to the pathogen.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrey Gerasimov","author_inst":"I.M.

Nearly five million individuals have since been diagnosed with this increasingly common and potentially lethal viral infection. Emerging evidence suggests a disproportionate burden of illness and death among minority communities. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ethnicity on outcomes among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Northern Nevada. Design: Single-center, retrospective observational study Materials and methods: The electronic health records of 172 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were obtained from a 946-bed tertiary referral center serving Northern Nevada. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared by ethnic group (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic). Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of mortality. Results: Among 172 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12th and May 8th, 2020, 87 (50.6%) identified as Hispanic and 81 (47.1%) as non-Hispanic. The mean age was 46.0 among Hispanics and 55.8 among non-Hispanics. Comorbidities linked to increased COVID-19-related mortality - hypertension, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - were more common among the non-Hispanic population. Hispanic individuals were significantly more likely to be uninsured and to live in low-income communities as compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts (27.6% versus 8.2% and 52.9% versus 30.6%, respectively). Hispanic patients were also less likely than non-Hispanics to have a primary care provider (42.5% versus 61.2%). However, mortality was significantly higher among the non-Hispanic population (15.3% versus 5.8%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Hispanic individuals in Northern Nevada, who account for only 25.7% of the population but over half of the confirmed cases. Hispanic individuals were younger and had fewer comorbidities than their non-Hispanic counterparts; consequently, despite considerable socioeconomic disadvantage, mortality was lower among the Hispanic population. The underlying causes of ethnic disparities in COVID-19 incidence remain to be established, but further investigation may lead to more effective community- and systems-based interventions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Antwi-Amoabeng","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bryce David Beutler","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Munadel Awad","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zahara Kanji","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sumaiya Mahboob","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Ghuman","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Boppana","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Salman Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark B.

The overall summaries at coarser spatial scales that are obtained by simply averaging individual curves (across regions) obscure nuanced variability and blurs the spatial heterogeneity at finer spatial scales. We employ statistical methods to analyze shapes of local COVID-19 growth rate curves and statistically group them into distinct clusters, according to their shapes. Using this information, we derive the so-called elastic averages of curves within these clusters, which correspond to the dominant incidence patterns. We apply this methodology to the analysis of the daily incidence trajectory of the COVID-pandemic at two spatial scales: A state-level analysis within the USA and a country-level analysis within Europe during mid-February to mid-May, 2020. Our analyses reveal a few dominant incidence trajectories that characterize transmission dynamics across states in the USA and across countries in Europe. This approach results in broad classifications of spatial areas into different trajectories and adds to the methodological toolkit for guiding public health decision making at different spatial scales.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anuj Srivastava","author_inst":"Florida State University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Peter Howley","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Stojanovski","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Sumaiya Mahboob","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Ghuman","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sri Harsha Boppana","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Salman Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark B.

Interestingly, the 7-days infectivity and death rates oscillations are almost in phase, showing local maxima on Thursdays\/Fridays and local minima on Sundays\/Mondays. These observations are in stark contrast with a known pattern, correlating the death rate with the reduced medical staff in hospitals on the weekends. One possible hypothesis addressing these observations is that they reflect a gradually increasing stress with the progressing week, which can trigger the maximal death rates observed on Thursdays\/Fridays. Moreover, assuming the weekends provide the likely time for new infections, the maximum number of new cases might fall again on Thursdays\/Fridays.

We evaluated differences in clinic and radiologic findings of multiple generations of COVID-19 infection in Xi'an (Shaanxi, China) to provide more clues for the correct estimate of the disease. METHODS: All COVID-19 infected patients reported in Xi'an up to 10 February 2020 were included for this analysis. Among these cases, clinical and chest CT data of 62 cases were obtained from three hospital in Xi'an. With this information, patients were grouped on basis of exposure history and transmission chains as first-generation, second-generation and third-generation patients. We described clinical characteristics and evaluated CT score\/patterns in these COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: There was a clear age differences in multiple generations with COVID-19 infection. Above two thirds of the second-generation (75.0%) and third-generation patients (77.8%) were aged [&ge;]45 years while 40.0% of first-generation cases at this age (p=0.001). More than half of second-generation patients (52.8%) and third-generation patients (55.6%) have comorbidities and is predominantly hypertensive (22.8% of second-generation vs. 27.8% of third-generation infections). The main exposure of second- and third-generation patients in Xi'an is family exposure (35.2%). For evaluation of CT findings of pulmonary involvement, the total CT score were 4.22{+\/-}3.00 in first-generation group, 4.35{+\/-}3.03 in second-generation group and 7.62{+\/-}3.56 in third-generation group (p<0.001). In all of three generations, the predominant pattern of abnormality observed was organizing pneumonia (65.5% in first-generation group, 61.5% in second-generation group and 71.4% in third-generation group). The average courses of the disease in third-generation infections has obviously extension (22.93{+\/-}7.22 days of first-generation, 21.53{+\/-}8.31 days of second-generation vs. 31.00{+\/-}8.12 days of third-generation group, p=0.004). There were no significant differences of the pulmonary sequelae among three generation patients. CONCLUSION: There is more serious pulmonary infection of COVID-19 pneumonia in second- and third-generation patients, which might be attribute to the elder age and comorbidity of these patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Runqing Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Jian","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Chao Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Ting Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Huifang Zhao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zekun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, the Eighth Hospital of Xi'an"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Xi'an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lingxia Zeng","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Jian Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"George J Hruza","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, St. Louis University"},{"author_name":"Lindy P Fox","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Huong Thi Thu Phung","author_inst":"NTT Hi-Tech Institute, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Sam Michael","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"William Gilette","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Memoli","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Naomi Akagi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"David N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Neil Neumann","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Qazi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yale A Santos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerie Green","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Phillip Williamson","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Nancy K Hills","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chuanyi M Lu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.
