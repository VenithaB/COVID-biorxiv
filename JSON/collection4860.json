There are though misconceptions on what means an effective high testing rate. This paper demonstrates that the rate of tests per detected case (Tests\/Case) is the critical variable, correlating negatively with the number of deaths. The higher the Tests\/Case rate, the lower the death rate, as this predictor is causally related to contact tracing and isolation of the vectors of the disease. Doubling Tests\/Case typically divides by about three the number of deaths. On the other hand, the per capita testing rate is a poor predictor for the performance of policies to fight the pandemics. The number of tests per 1,000 inhabitants (Tests\/1,000) tends to correlate positively with the number of deaths. In some cases, high levels of Tests\/1,000 just mean an epidemic that ran out of control, with an explosion of cases that demands high testing rates just to confirm the diagnosis of the seriously sick. This study also demonstrates that an early tracing strategy, with a high level of Tests\/Case, reduces combined costs of testing and hospitalization dramatically. Therefore, the common claim that tracing strategies are unaffordable by poorer countries is incorrect. On the contrary, it is the most adequate, both from the economic and humanitarian points of view.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Knudsen","author_inst":"Independent consultant"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117929","rel_title":"Therapeutic Anticoagulation Is Associated with Decreased Mortality in Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117929","rel_abs":"Objective: To evaluate differences in morbidity and mortality among mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 treated with therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 245 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation from March 1, 2020 through April 11, 2020 at Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients either received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days or prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Morbidity and mortality data were analyzed. Results: Propensity score (PS) weighted Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated a survival advantage (57% vs. 25%) at 35 days from admission to the ICU in patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days compared to those who received prophylactic anticoagulation during their hospital course. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model with PS weights to adjust for baseline differences found a 79% reduction in death in patients who were therapeutically anticoagulated HR 0.209, [95% CI (0.10, 0.46), p <0.001]. Bleeding complications were similar between both groups. A 26.7% [95% CI (1.16, 1.39), p<0.001] excess mortality was found for each 1 mg\/dL rise in serum creatinine over a 21-day period.

For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We use an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision making. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leila Taghizadeh","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Karimi","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)"},{"author_name":"Clemens Heitzinger","author_inst":"Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien)"},{"author_name":"Hoda Makhlouf","author_inst":"Assiut Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roopa Kohli-Seth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sanam Ahmed","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Levin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Martin D Chen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117424","rel_title":"Evaluating the adequacy of Prima Covid-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test for the assessment of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117424","rel_abs":"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 found health authorities worldwide unprepared to control the pandemic. The adoption of accurate, rapid and inexpensive methods to identify infected subjects in the general population is of paramount relevance for the control of the disease. We evaluated one of the available serological tests, the Prima Lab Covid-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Tests, on 739 volunteers. We first assessed the test's reproducibility by administering it twice on the same day on 104 subjects obtaining and overall score of 93 percent. Since the intensity of the color in the test line regions varies depending on the concentration of Covid-19 antibodies in each sample and that the determination of the positivity depends strictly on the subjective assessment by the reader, after excluding the subjects whose color intensity was too tenuous to be deemed unquestionably positive by the reader the reproducibility increased to 96%. The test would not perform properly for 6 subjects for a very limited overall technical failure of 0.83%. For 138 subjects information was available regarding a previous Real Time PCR nasopharyngeal swab test performed elsewhere. The correspondence of positive results between the two tests was 90.58% (125\/138).

Design: case-control study Setting: isolated rooms in the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw (which had been transformed into an infectious hospital) and a dormitory in one of Warsaw universities. Participants: 52 SARS-CoV-2 positive (51 men, mean age 21.7 years) and 36 negative students (34 men, mean age 20.8 years). Main outcome measures: a gustatory function assessment (sweet, salty, sour and bitter taste), with flavour concentrations established previously in healthy subjects was conducted for all subjects. Each participant received one tasteless reference and nine flavour tablets with sucrose concentrations of 40, 80 and 106.4 mg\/ml; NaCl at 13.5, 17 and 27 mg\/ml; ascorbic acid at 6.25 and 12.5 mg\/ml and grapefruit extract at 40 mg\/ml. Results: the only taste that was impaired significantly more frequently in COVID-19 patients was the sweet taste at the lowest flavour concentration (40 mg\/ml, p = 0.002). Different screening and diagnostic models were constructed using the examined variables. The highest accuracy screening test consisted of the positive result of a three-question questionnaire (self-reported loss of taste, self-reported loss of smell, or fever within the last month (positive if at least one present) and\/or ageusia of sweet taste at a sucrose concentration of 40 mg\/ml. The sensitivity of the model was 94% with a specificity of 55%.

The specificity of the test was found to be 100%, and the sensitivity was 34%. Conclusion: as the most effective way of controlling the present pandemic involves testing the wider population for symptomatic, oligosymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and isolating or hospitalising infected subjects, in the present study, an inexpensive, simple, fast and sensitive (94%) screening test that can be used for such a purpose is proposed. In addition, a specific (100%) diagnostic test that could be used to refer patients to quarantine in the case of limited availability of genetic or serological tests is proposed.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kamil Adamczyk","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Michal Herman","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Janusz Fraczek","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Robert Piec","author_inst":"Main School of Fire Service, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Barbara Szykula-Piec","author_inst":"Main School of Fire Service, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Rafal Wojtowicz","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Bojanowski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ewa Rusyan","author_inst":"Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland, UHE Satellite Campus in Warsaw, University of Humanities and Eco"},{"author_name":"Edward Franek","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw;  Mossakowski Clinical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119198","rel_title":"Evaluation of symptomatic patient saliva as a sample type for the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119198","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has presented significant challenges for laboratories including supply chain limitations with restricted access to reagents and sample collection materials (i.e. swabs, viral transport media (VTM)) for patients testing.

A set of newly developed Pandemic Projection Measures (PPM) had been successfully applied to project daily new cases across countries. During the development, numerous trial and error iterations had been performed and then improved with live data. The procedures and computations for the PPM including Uphill Index (UHI), Downhill Indices (DHI), and Error Band Projection (EBP) estimates were explained and discussed along with graphical projections. The PPM was computed with daily live data for the USA, four U.S. states (Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York), France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and China. The results indicated that with the PPM estimations, the daily projections for the future trend were robust to reflect the most plausibility, since the PPM can be updated frequently. With the most up-to-date predictions, governments should be able to monitor the values of UHI and DHI for making a better decision for  flattening the curve. Based on the empirical data, policymakers should pay more attentions for the following two scenarios: a) When expecting an apex of the outbreak, the UHI is higher than 1.20; and b) After passing a peak day, the DHI is still larger than 0.925. The applications of the PPM estimates are not designed for a one-time projection rather than updated frequently to improve the prediction precisions. With the same concepts from the PPM computations, the peak day and the number of new deaths could be predictable if more data are collected. Like many country leaders saying,  We will win the battle of coronavirus pandemic, the author hopes to use this easily applicable estimate method to save more lives and to win. The results, currently presented with the data on April 16 and 17, 2020, were only used to explain how to apply the PPM estimates for predictions.

Estimations of transmission parameters between compartments are typically done through stochastic parameterization processes that depend upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wide expensive to collect. We apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purposes of simulating the dynamics of the US COVID-19 epidemics and projecting its further development. Methods: We construct a compartmental model. We develop a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the models transmission parameters. We then feed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict the development of the US COVID-19 epidemics for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R_0) becomes less than one. Results: The deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R_0 will become less than one around June 19 to July 3, 2020, at which point the epidemics will effectively start to die out, and that the US Infected population will peak round June 18 to July 2, 2020 between 1.34 million and 1.41 million individual cases. The models also predict that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 2 million mark around June 10 to 11, 2020. Conclusions: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"QI DENG","author_inst":"Zhejiang Normal University; Cofintelligence Fintech Co.

Available point-of-care diagnostic systems as lateral flow assays have high potential for fast and easy on-site antibody testing but are lacking specificity, sensitivity or possibility for quantitative measurements. Here, a new point-of-care approach for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection in human serum based on magnetic immuno-detection is described and compared to standard ELISA. For magnetic immuno-detection, immunofiltration columns were coated with a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide. SARS-CoV-2 peptide reactive antibodies, spiked at different concentrations into PBS and human serum, were rinsed through immunofiltration columns. Specific antibodies were retained within the IFC and labelled with an isotype specific biotinylated antibody. Streptavidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were applied to label the secondary antibodies. Enriched magnetic nanoparticles were then detected by means of frequency magnetic mixing detection technology, using a portable magnetic read-out device. Measuring signals corresponded to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the sample. Our preliminary magnetic immuno-detection setup resulted in a higher sensitivity and broader detection range and was four times faster than ELISA. Further optimizations could reduce assay times to that of a typical lateral flow assay, enabling a fast and easy approach, well suited for point-of-care measurements without expensive lab equipment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Pietschmann","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Nadja Voepel","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Holger Spiegel","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Hans-Joachim Krause","author_inst":"Institute of Biological Information Processing, Bioelectronics IBI-3, Forschungszentrum Juelich, 52428 Juelich"},{"author_name":"Florian Schroeper","author_inst":"Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME, Forckenbeckstrasse 6, 52074 Aachen"},{"author_name":"Anjali Bararia","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Abey Thomas","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Ravi Sarode","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Andrew E Clark","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Alagarraju Muthukumar","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland, UHE Satellite Campus in Warsaw, University of Humanities and Eco"},{"author_name":"Edward Franek","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw;  Mossakowski Clinical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.131474","rel_title":"Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses by using LAMP method with Nanopore Flongle workflow","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.131474","rel_abs":"The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a global public health emergency infected by SARC-CoV-2 has caused devastating loss around the world.

Designed vaccine was rich in effective BCR and TCR epitopes screened from the sequence of S-protein of SARS-CoV2. Predicted BCR and TCR epitopes were antigenic in nature non-toxic and probably non-allergen. Modelled and refined tertiary structure was predicted as valid for further use. Protein-Protein interaction prediction of TLR2\/4 and designed vaccine indicates promising binding. Designed multiepitope vaccine has induced cell mediated and humoral immunity along with increased interferon gamma response. Macrophages and dendritic cells were also found increased over the vaccine exposure. In silico codon optimization and cloning in expression vector indicates that vaccine can be efficiently expressed in E. coli. In conclusion, predicted vaccine is a good antigen, probable no allergen and has potential to induce cellular and humoral immunity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gunderao H Kathwate","author_inst":"Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune (MS), India"},{"author_name":"Weipeng Quan","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Shuge Yan","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Shuangju Wu","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Jianhu Qin","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Tingting Yang","author_inst":"Grandomcis"},{"author_name":"Fan Liang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Yu Liang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Alagarraju Muthukumar","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland, UHE Satellite Campus in Warsaw, University of Humanities and Eco"},{"author_name":"Edward Franek","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw;  Mossakowski Clinical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.130849","rel_title":"A Deep Dive into the SARS-Cov-2 Polymerase Assembly: Identifying Novel Allosteric Sites and Analyzing the Hydrogen Bond Networks and Correlated Dynamics","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.130849","rel_abs":"Replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a fundamental step in the virus life cycle and inhibiting the SARS-CoV2 replicase machinery has been proven recently as a promising approach in combating the virus.

This includes understanding the dynamicity of the various polymerase subdomains, analyzing the hydrogen bond networks at the active site and at the template entry in the presence of water, studying the binding modes of the nucleotides at the active site, highlighting positions for acceptable nucleotides substitutions that can be tolerated at different positions within the nascent RNA strand, identifying possible allosteric sites within the polymerase structure and studying their correlated dynamics relative to the catalytic site. Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotides substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex. We also report here three \"druggable\" allosteric sites within the nsp12 RdRp that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Our correlated motion analysis shows that the dynamics within one of the newly identified sites are linked to the active site, indicating that targeting this site can significantly impact the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khaled Barakat","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."},{"author_name":"Marawan Ahmed","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."},{"author_name":"Yasser Tabana","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."},{"author_name":"Minwoo Ha","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhu Qin","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Tingting Yang","author_inst":"Grandomcis"},{"author_name":"Fan Liang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Yu Liang","author_inst":"Grandomics"},{"author_name":"Alagarraju Muthukumar","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland, UHE Satellite Campus in Warsaw, University of Humanities and Eco"},{"author_name":"Edward Franek","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw;  Mossakowski Clinical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.131987","rel_title":"Analyzing hCov genome sequences: Applying Machine Intelligence and beyond","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.131987","rel_abs":"Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the sars-cov-2 strain of coronavirus, has affected millions of people all over the world and taken thousands of lives.

Here, we deep-sequenced the complete SARS-CoV-2 S gene from 18 patients (10 with mild and 8 with severe COVID-19), and found that the virus accumulates deletions upstream and very close to the S1\/S2 cleavage site, generating a frameshift with appearance of a stop codon.

Because many individuals shed virus for days before symptom onset, and many show mild or no symptoms, an emergent and unprecedented need exists for development and deployment of sensitive and high throughput molecular diagnostic tests. RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) is a highly multiplexed technology for targeted analysis of polyadenylated mRNA, which incorporates sample barcoding for massively parallel analyses. Here we present a more generalized method, capture RASL-seq (\u201ccRASL-seq\u201d), which enables analysis of any targeted pathogen-(and\/or host-) associated RNA molecules. cRASL-seq enables highly sensitive (down to \u223c1-100 pfu\/ml or cfu\/ml) and highly multiplexed (up to \u223c10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens. Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid extraction or reverse transcription, steps that have caused testing bottlenecks associated with other assays. Our simplified workflow additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new surveillance technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.Competing Interest StatementJ.J.C. and H.B.L. are listed as inventors on a patent describing the cRASL-seq method.

We select 44 complete Sarbecovirus genomes at evolutionary distances ideally-suited for protein-coding and non-coding element identification, create whole-genome alignments, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for all named genes and for 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and also ORF3c, a novel alternate-frame gene. By contrast, ORF10, and overlapping-ORFs 9c, 3b, and 3d lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence and are not protein-coding. Furthermore, we show no other protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures largely agree at the gene, amino-acid, and nucleotide levels, with some notable exceptions, including fewer-than-expected mutations in nsp3 and Spike subunit S1, and more-than-expected mutations in Nucleocapsid. The latter also shows a cluster of amino-acid-changing variants in otherwise-conserved residues in a predicted B-cell epitope, which may indicate positive selection for immune avoidance. Several Spike-protein mutations, including D614G, which has been associated with increased transmission, disrupt otherwise-perfectly-conserved amino acids, and could be novel adaptations to human hosts.

The model is arrived after least square fitting of epidemic behaviour model based on theoretical formulation to the real data of cumulative infection cases reported between 24 March 2020 and 15 May 2020. The predictive capability of the model has been validated with real data of infection cases reported during May 15-30, 2020. A detailed analysis of model predictions in terms of future trend of COVID-19 progress individually in 18 states of India and India as a whole has been attempted. Infection rate in India as a whole is continuously decreasing with time and has reached 3 times lower than the initial infection rate after 6 weeks of lock down suggesting the effectiveness of the lockdown in containing the epidemic. Results suggest that India as a whole could see the peak and end of the epidemic in the month of July 2020 and January 2021. As per the current trend in the data, active infected cases in India may reach 2 lakhs at the peak time and total infected cases may reach around 14 lakhs. State-wise results have been discussed in the manuscript. However, the prediction may deviate particularly for longer dates, as assumptions of model cannot be met always in a real scenario. In view of this, a real time application (COV-IND Predictor) has been developed which automatically syncs the latest data from COVID19 dash board on daily basis and update the model input parameters and predictions of relevant results on daily basis.

While Remdesivir has recently received FDA emergency use authorization for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, convalescent plasma (CP) with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from recovered donors remains a promising and widely accessible method to mitigate severe disease symptoms. Here, we describe the development and validation of a cell-free neutralization PCR assay using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 and human ACE2 receptor-DNA conjugates. By comparing with samples collected prior to the outbreak, we confirmed that NAbs were specifically detected in COVID-19 cases. Using our unique assay, the NAb signals are detectable as early as 10 days after onset of symptoms and continue to rise, plateauing after 18 days. Notably, we showed that the use of licensed pathogen reduction technology to inactivate potentially contaminating infectious pathogens in CP did not alter NAb signals, paving a path to safely administer effective CP therapies. The described neutralization PCR assay can serve as a qualification tool to easily identify suitable CP donors of a potentially lifesaving therapy. In addition, this assay tool is readily deployable in standard laboratories with biosafety level 2 capability, and can yield results within 2-3 hr. This advancement can facilitate research on factors driving diverse COVID-19 disease manifestations, and to evaluate the impact of various CP processing protocols on CP therapeutic efficacy.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth Danh","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Donna Grace Karp","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Peter V Robinson","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"David Seftel","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anil Bagri","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Martin Schreibman","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Buser","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Holbro","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Laurence M Corash","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Carl Hanson","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheng-ting Tsai","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Steinegger","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Harry Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20086025","rel_title":"Age differences in clinical features and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, Jiangsu, China: a retrospective, multi-center cohort study","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20086025","rel_abs":"Objectives To determine the age-specific clinical presentations and incidence of adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China. Design and setting This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study performed at twenty-four hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Participants From January 10 to March 15, 2020, 625 patients with COVID-19 were involved. Results Of the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 [52.6%] males), 37 (5.9%) were children (18 years or less), 261 (40%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7%) middle-aged adults (45-64 years), and 79 (12.6%) elderly (65 years or more). The incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, P < .0001, P = 0.0003, P < .0001, and P < .0001 respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared to children (Chi-square test, P = 0.0008, 0.0146, and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both P < .0001). Older patients had significantly more abnormal values in many laboratory parameters than younger patients. Elderly patients contributed the highest proportion of severe or critically-ill cases (33.0%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) (35.4%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), and respiratory failure (31.6%, Chi-square test P = 0.0266), and longest hospital stay (21 days, ANOVA-test P < 0.001). Conclusions Elderly ([&ge;]65) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure, and the longest hospital stay, which may be due partly to that they had higher incidence of comorbidities and poor immune responses to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huanyuan Luo","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM)"},{"author_name":"Songqiao Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University Zhongda Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuancheng Wang","author_inst":"Southeast University Zhongda Hospital"},{"author_name":"Penelope A.

Existing studies of COVID-19 using mathematical models are unable to accommodate the need for meso-scale modeling, because of the unavailability of COVID-19 data at this scale and the different timings of local intervention policies. In this respect, we propose a meso-scale mathematical model of COVID-19 using town-level infection data in the state of Connecticut. We consider the spatial interaction in terms of the inter-town travel in the model. Based on the developed model, we evaluated how different strengths of social distancing policy enforcement may impact future epidemic curves based on two evaluative metrics: compliance and containment.

Some propose global testing to effectively contain Covid-19. Current tests for Covid-19 are administered individually. These tests for Covid-19 are expensive and are limited due to the lack of resources and time. We propose a simple and efficient group testing method for Covid-19. We propose a group testing method where test subjects are grouped and tested. Depending on the result of the group test, subsequent sub groups are formed and tested recursively based on a quartery search algorithm. We designed and built an evaluation model that simulates test subject population, infected test subjects according to available Covid-19 statistics, and the group testing processes in SCALE19. We considered several population models including USA and the world. Our results show that we can significantly reduce the required number of tests up to 89% without sacrificing the accuracy of the individual test of the entire population. For USA, up to 280 million tests can be reduced from the total US population of 331 million and it would be equivalent saving of $28 billion assuming a cost of $100 per test. For the world, 6.96 billion tests can be reduced from the total population of 7.8 billion and it would be equivalent to saving $696 billion. We propose SCALE19 can significantly reduce the total required number of tests compared to individual tests of the entire population.

We herein report the first set of data of our prospective cohort study of 90 hospitalized cases. Serological surveys were thoroughly performed over 2 month period by assessing IgG and IgM responses by immunofluorescence, immunoblot, Western blot and conventional ELISA using clinical RUN isolates of SARS-CoV-2 immobilized on 96 well plates. While the IgM and, unexpectedly, the IgG responses were readily detected early during the course of the disease (5-7 days post-first symptoms), our results (n=3-5 and over the full dilution set of the plasma 1\/200 to 1\/12800) demonstrated a significant decrease (over 2.5-fold) of IgG levels in severe (ICU) hospitalized patients (exemplified in patient 1) by WB and ELISA. In contrast, mild non-ICU patients had a steady and yet robust rise in their specific IgG levels against the virus. Interestingly, both responses (IgM and IgG) were initially against the nucleocapsid (50kDa band on the WB) and spreading to other major viral protein S and domains (S1 and S2. In conclusion, serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of patients with negative RT-PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, medical care and protections should be maintained particularly for recovered patients (severe cases) who may remain at risk of relapsing or reinfection. Experiments to ascertain T cell responses but although their kinetics overtime are now highly warranted. All in all, these studies will help to delineate the best routes for vaccination.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony Dobi","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Etienne Frumence","author_inst":"Laboratoire immunologie Clinique et experimentale de la ZOI (LICE-OI), Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Mahary LALARIZO RAKOTO","author_inst":"Laboratoire immunologie Clinique et experimentale de la ZOI (LICE-OI), Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Gregorie Lebeau","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Damien Vagner","author_inst":"UMR PIMIT Processus infectieux en milieu Insulaire tropical CNRS 9192, INSERM1187, IRD 249, Universite de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Anne-Laure SANDENON SETEYEN","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Claude Giry","author_inst":"CNR associe arbovirus, Laboratoire de Microbiologie, Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Axelle Septembre-Malaterre","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Marie-Christine Jaffar-Bandjee","author_inst":"CNR associe arbovirus, Laboratoire de Microbiologie, Pole de Biologie, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Loic Raffray","author_inst":"Service de Medecine Interne, CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Philippe Gasque","author_inst":"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis"},{"author_name":"Laurence M Corash","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Carl Hanson","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cheng-ting Tsai","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Steinegger","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Harry Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110387","rel_title":"Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria","rel_date":"2020-06-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110387","rel_abs":"A novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged from the Wuhan city of China at the end of 2019, causing devastating public health and socio-economic burden around the world. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral for use in humans, control and mitigation efforts against COVID-19 are focussed on using non-pharmaceutical interventions (aimed at reducing community transmission of COVID-19), such as social (physical)-distancing, community lockdown, use of face masks in public, isolation and contact tracing of confirmed cases and quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to COVID-19. We developed a mathematical model for understanding the transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in Nigeria, one of the main epicenters of COVID-19 in Africa. Rigorous analysis of the Kermack-McKendrick-type compartmental epidemic model we developed, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, reveal that the model has a continuum of disease-free equilibria which is locally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, called the it control reproduction (denoted by Rc), is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that the pandemic can be effectively controlled (or even eliminated) in Nigeria if the control strategies implemented can bring (and maintain) the epidemiological threshold (Rc) to a value less than unity. The model, which was parametrized using COVID-19 data published by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), was used to assess the community-wide impact of various control and mitigation strategies in the entire Nigerian nation, as well as in two states (Kano and Lagos) within the Nigerian federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT Abuja). It was shown that, for the worst-case scenario where social-distancing, lockdown and other community transmission reduction measures are not implemented, Nigeria would have recorded a devastatingly high COVID-19 mortality by April 2021 (in hundreds of thousands). It was, however, shown that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled using social-distancing measures provided its effectiveness level is at least moderate. Although the use of face masks in the public can significantly reduce COVID-19 in Nigeria, its use as a sole intervention strategy may fail to lead to the realistic elimination of the disease (since such elimination requires unrealistic high compliance in face mask usage in the public, in the range of 80% to 95%). COVID-19 elimination is feasible in both the entire Nigerian nation, and the States of Kano and Lagos, as well as the FCT, if the public face masks use strategy (using mask with moderate efficacy, and moderate compliance in its usage) is complemented with a social-distancing strategy. The lockdown measures implemented in Nigeria on March 30, 2020 need to be maintained for at least three to four months to lead to the effective containment of COVID-19 outbreaks in the country. Relaxing, or fully lifting, the lockdown measures sooner, in an effort to re-open the economy or the country, may trigger a deadly second wave of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enahoro A.

This study aimed to review the trial designs of SOLIDARITY and DisCoVeRy and their feasibility to generate high-quality evidence. Method: A systematic search of the European Clinical trial registry, the U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) created by the World Health Organization (WHO) was conducted on May 10th, 2020 to identify the study details of the SOLIDARITY and DisCoVeRy trials. A supplementary search of PubMed, the websites of the WHO and French authorities, and Google search engine was conducted. A critical review was performed on the findings. Results: The DisCoVeRy trial design was detailed consistently in both the European and the US clinical rial registries. SOLIDARITY was registered on ICTRP, with country-specific information reported on country-level registry platforms. The design of DisCoVeRy trial appears to be ideal from the methodological perspective. Both trials appear difficult to implement, impractical, and disconnected from the pandemic reality. This is consistent with the apparent failure of the trials to deliver conclusions before the end of the pandemic.

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered DMB would require oxygen therapy and\/or intensive care support than those who did not. Methodology: Cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 50 and above in a tertiary academic hospital who received DMB compared to a recent cohort who did not. Patients were administered oral vitamin D3 1000 IU OD, magnesium 150mg OD and vitamin B12 500mcg OD (DMB) upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration post-DMB administration leading to any form of oxygen therapy and\/or intensive care support. Results: Between 15 January and 15 April 2020, 43 consecutive COVID-19 patients aged [&ge;]50 were identified. 17 patients received DMB and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups was significantly different in age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension showed significant influence on outcome while DMB retained protective significance after adjusting for age or hypertension separately in multivariate analysis. Fewer DMB patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during their hospitalization (17.6% vs 61.5%, P=0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03 - 0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI: 0.04 - 0.93) for oxygen therapy and\/or intensive care support on univariate and multivariate analyses respectively.

This study supports further larger randomized control trials to ascertain the full benefit of DMB in ameliorating COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chuen Wen Tan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liam Pock Ho","author_inst":"Singapore general hospital"},{"author_name":"Shirin Kalimuddin","author_inst":"SIngapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Pei Zhi Cherng","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yii Ean Teh","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Siew Yee Thien","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hei Man Wong","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paul Jie Wen Tern","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jason Wai Mun Chay","author_inst":"Sengkang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chandramouli Nagarajan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rehena Sultana","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heng Joo Ng","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-ting Tsai","author_inst":"Enable Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Martin Steinegger","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Harry Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
