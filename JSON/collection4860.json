Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations. The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development. Overall this study provides genomic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 has adapted and will continue to adapt to humans.\n\nSUMMARYIn this study we sought signals of evolution to identify how the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the genome is largely undergoing purifying selection that maintains its ancestral sequence. However, we identified multiple positions on the genome that appear to confer an adaptive advantage based on their repeated evolution in independent lineages. This information indicates how SARS-CoV-2 will evolve as it diversifies in an increasing number of hosts.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erik  Scott Wright","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Seema  S Lakdawala","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Vaughn  S Cooper","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111104","rel_title":"Lifestyle acquired immunity, decentralized intelligent infrastructures and revised healthcare expenditures may limit pandemic catastrophe: a lesson from COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111104","rel_abs":"Human race has often faced pandemic with substantial number of fatalities. As COVID-19 pandemic reached and endured in every corner on earth, countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure seemed to struggle in containing disease transmission and casualties. COVID-19 affected countries have variability in demographic, socioeconomic and life style health indicators. At this context it is important to find out at what extent these parametric variations are actually modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, we have selected demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators e.g. population density, percentage of urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g. COVID-19 test positive, case fatality and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggest that countries with variable median age has significantly different outcome on test positive rate (P<0.01). Both median age (P=0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P=0.0041) has positive relation with case recovery. Increasing number of test per 100K population showed positive and negative relation with number of positives per 100K population (P=0.0001) and percentage of test positives (P<0.0001) respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P=0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P=0.0389) and NCDs mortalities (P=0.0477) also showed statistical relation with case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had better recovery rate. Investment in health sector alone is insufficient in controlling pandemic severity. Intelligent and sustainable healthcare both in urban and rural settings and healthy lifestyle acquired immunity may reduce disease transmission and comorbidity induced fatalities respectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Ahmed","author_inst":"Khulna University"},{"author_name":"Tasnima Haque","author_inst":"BIHS General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Health Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20095406","rel_title":"Modeling the dynamics of COVID-19 using Q-SEIR model with age-stratified infection probability","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20095406","rel_abs":"We explore the advantage of age-stratifying the population as an improvement on the quarantine-modified SEIR model. We hypothesize that this would project lower cases of infection for the Philippines because of our country's low median age. We introduce the variable U that is multiplied to the incubation rate sigma; when exposed individuals become infected. U is the dot product of the proxy infection probabilities stratified per age group (F) and the population stratified per age group (P) divided by the total population, similar to calculating mathematical expectation. Proxies were taken from two data sets: Hubei, China with a calculated value of U_CHN=0.4447 and Quezon City, Philippines with U_QC=0.5074. When the majority age group, represented by the median age, is far from the age group with the highest number of infections the number of infected individuals decreases and produces a delayed peaking effect. This new method gives a much lower estimate on peak number of infected cases by 65.2% compared with age-stratification alone; and by 75.2% compared with Q-SEIR alone.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Frankie Rayo","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Diliman"},{"author_name":"Romulo de Castro","author_inst":"Center for Informatics, University of San Agustin, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Jesus Emmanuel Sevilleja","author_inst":"National Center for Mental Health, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Vena Pearl Bongolan","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Diliman"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20098350","rel_title":"A phenomenological algorithm for short-range predictions of the Covid-19 pandemics 2020","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20098350","rel_abs":"We present an algorithm for dynamical fitting of a logistic curve to the Covid-19 epidemics data, with fit-parameters linearly evolving to the future.

Lymphopenia and cytokine levels are tightly associated with disease severity. However, virus-induced immune dysregulation at cellular and molecular levels remains largely undefined. Here, the leukocytes in the pleural effusion, sputum, and peripheral blood biopsies from severe and mild patients were analyzed at single-cell resolution. Drastic T cell hyperactivation accompanying elevated T cell exhaustion was observed, predominantly in pleural effusion. The mechanistic investigation identified a group of CD14+ monocytes and macrophages highly expressing CD163 and MRC1 in the biopsies from severe patients, suggesting M2 macrophage polarization. These M2-like cells exhibited up-regulated IL10, CCL18, APOE, CSF1 (M-CSF), and CCL2 signaling pathways. Further, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were observed in pleural effusion earlier than in peripheral blood. Together, our results suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune dysregulation by inducing M2 polarization and subsequent T cell exhaustion. This study improves our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National

The logic is that face masks are low cost and might help prevent some transmission. However, from the start, the assumption that face masks are \"low cost\" was questioned. Early on, there were warnings of the opportunity cost of public use of medical masks given shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. This led to recommendations for cloth masks and other face coverings, with little evidence of their ability to prevent transmission. However, there may also be a high cost to these recommendations if people rely on face masks in place of other more effective ways to break transmission, such as staying home. We use SafeGraph smart device location data to show that the representative American in states that have face mask mandates spent 20-30 minutes less time at home, and increase visits to a number of commercial locations, following the mandate. Since the reproductive rate of SAR-COV2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19 is hovering right around one, such substitution behavior could be the difference between controlling the epidemic and a

pulmonary disease severity on chest radiographs (CXRs), for longitudinal disease evaluation and clinical risk stratification. Materials and Methods A convolutional Siamese neural network-based algorithm was trained to output a measure of pulmonary disease severity on anterior-posterior CXRs (pulmonary x-ray severity (PXS) score), using weakly-supervised pretraining on ~160,000 images from CheXpert and transfer learning on 314 CXRs from patients with COVID-19. The algorithm was evaluated on internal and external test sets from different hospitals, containing 154 and 113 CXRs respectively. The PXS score was correlated with a radiographic severity score independently assigned by two thoracic radiologists and one in-training radiologist. For 92 internal test set patients with follow-up CXRs, the change in PXS score was compared to radiologist assessments of change. The association between PXS score and subsequent intubation or death was assessed. Results The PXS score correlated with the radiographic pulmonary disease severity score assigned to CXRs in the COVID-19 internal and external test sets ({rho}=0.84 and {rho}=0.78 respectively). The direction of change in PXS score in follow-up CXRs agreed with radiologist assessment ({rho}=0.74). In patients not intubated on the admission CXR, the PXS score predicted subsequent intubation or death within three days of hospital admission (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve=0.80 (95%CI 0.75-0.85)). Conclusion A Siamese neural network-based severity score automatically measures COVID-19 pulmonary disease severity in chest radiographs, which can be scaled and rapidly deployed for clinical triage and workflow optimization.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew D Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nishanth Thumbavanam

Till now, there is no remedy for this epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective to control this pandemic. In this paper, we provide an analytical model on the effectiveness of the sustainable lockdown policy that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we analyze a noncooperative game environment that provides an incentive for maintaining social distancing. Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is also interpreted with the help of a game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing. Finally, an extensive numerical analysis is provided to study the impact of maintaining a social-distancing measure to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak. Numerical results show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anupam Kumar Bairagi","author_inst":"Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Rep. of Korea and Computer Science and Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna-9208, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mehedi Masud","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Taif University, Taif, KSA"},{"author_name":"Do Hyeon Kim","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Rep. of Korea"},{"author_name":"Md.

an infectious disease and also perceive the risks associated with such infectious disease tend to engage more in precautionary behaviour; however, little is known about this association as it relates to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). There is possibility of moderated mediation effect in the association between these variables. Objectives: To examine whether risk perception determines the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behaviour among Nigerians, taking into consideration the gender differentials that may exist in the process. Design: A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting: Participants were recruited via social media platform, WhatsApp using google form from March 28 to April 4, 2020. Participants: 1500-Nigerian (mean age =27.43, SD=9.75 with 42.7% females and 57.3% males) were recruited from 180 cities in Nigeria using snowball sampling technique. They responded to an online survey form comprising demographic questions and adapted versions of the Ebola knowledge scale, SARS risk perception scale and a precautionary behavior scale. Result: Moderated mediation analysis showed that risk perception mediated the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behavior and this indirect effect was moderated by gender. Having correct knowledge of COVID-19 was linked to higher involvement in precautionary behavior through risk perception for females but not for males. COVID-19 awareness campaigns may target raising more awareness of the risks associated with the infection in order to make individuals engage more in precautionary behaviors. Conclusion: Awareness campaigns and psychological intervention strategies may be particularly important at the moment, for males more than females.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Kator Iorfa","author_inst":"University of Nigeria Nsukka"},{"author_name":"Iboro F.A.

During the onset of a novel epidemic, there are public health priorities that need to be estimated, such as risk factors for infection, hospitalization, and clinical severity to allocate resources and issue health policies. In this work we calculate the risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19 conferred by demographic, lifestyle, and co-morbidity factors. Material and methods. This is a case-control study including the tested individuals for SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR officially reported by the Health Secretary of Mexico from January 01 to May 8, 2020 (102,875 subjects). Demographic (sex, age, foreign and immigrant status, native speaking, place of residence), life-style (smoking), and co-morbidities [diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure (HBP), asthma, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease other than HBP, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other not specified diseases (other diseases)] variables were included in this study. The risk of infection and hospitalization conferred by each variable was calculated with univariate (ULR) and multivariate (MLR) logistic regression models. Results. The place of residence (OR=4.91 living in Tijuana City), followed by advanced age (OR=6.71 in 61-70 years-old), suffering from diabetes (OR=1.87) or obesity (OR=1.61), being male (OR=1.55), having HBP (OR=1.52), and notoriously being indigenous (OR=1.49) conferred a higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma (OR=0.63), immunosuppression (OR=0.65) or smoking (OR=0.85) are protective factors against infection, while suffering from COPD does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, advanced age (OR=11.6 in [&ge;] 70 years-old) is the main factor for hospitalization due to Covid-19, followed by some co-morbidities, mainly diabetes (OR=3.69) and HBP (OR=2.79), being indigenous (OR=1.89), male sex (OR=1.67) and the place of residence (OR=4.22 for living in Juarez City). Unlike the protective risk against infection, immunosuppression (OR=2.69) and COPD (OR=3.63), contribute to the risk of being hospitalized, while having asthma (OR=0.7) also provides protection against hospitalization. Conclusions. In addition to confirming that older age, diabetes, HBP and obesity are the main risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19, we found that being indigenous, immunosuppression, smoking and asthma protect against infection, and the latter also against hospitalization.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaime Berumen","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Max Schmulson","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Jesus Alegre","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe Guerrero","author_inst":"Hospital General de Mexico, Dr. Eduardo Liceaga, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Olaiz","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion en politicas, poblacion y salud, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rosa M.

Disease 2019(COVID-19) has constituted a global pandemic. But the question about the immune mechanism of patients with COVID-19 is unclear and cause particular concern to the world. Here, we launched a follow-up analysis of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 of 192 COVID-19 patients, aiming to depict a kinetics profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and explore the related factors of antibodies expression against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patient. Methods: A total of 192 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the designated hospital of Guangzhou , Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, from January to February 2020 were selected as the study cohort. A cohort of 130 COVID-19 suspects who had been excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infected by negative RT-PCR result and 209 healthy people were enrolled in this study. Detection of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 were performed by Chemiluminescence immunoassay in different groups . Results: It has been found that the seroconversion time of IgM against SARS-CoV-2 in most patients was 5-10 days after the symptoms onset , and then rose rapidly, reaching a peak around 2 to 3 weeks, and the median peak concentration was 2.705 AU \/ mL. The peak of IgM maintained within one week, and then enters the descending channel. IgG seroconverted later than or synchronously with IgM, reaching peaks around 3 to 4 weeks.The median peak concentration was 33.998AU \/ ml,which was higher than that of IgM . IgM titers begins to gradually decrease after reaching the peak in the 4th week, after the 8th week, a majority of IgM in patient's serum started to turn negative. On the contrary, titers of IgG began to decline slightly after the fifth week, and more than 90% of results of patients were positive after 8 weeks. Additionally, the concentration of antibodies positively correlated with the severity of the disease and the duration of virus exist in host. Conclusion: We depict a kinetics profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and found out that the levels of antibodies were related to the disease severity,age, gender and virus clearance or continuous proliferation of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingyi Ou","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical

The study also built a simple mean aggregated method established on the performance of 3 regression techniques such as Support Vector Regression (SVR, NN, and LR), Neural Network, and Linear Regression. Result: The results showed that COVID-19 disease can correctly be predicted. The result of the prediction shows that COVID-19 ailment could be conveyed through water and air ecological variables and so preventives measures such as social distancing, wearing of mask and hand gloves, staying at home can help to avert the circulation of the sickness thereby resulting in reduced active cases and even mortality. Conclusion: It was established that the projected method outperformed when likened to previously obtainable practical models on the bases of prediction precision. Hence, putting in place the preventive measures can effectively manage the spread of COVID-19, and also the death rate will be reduced and eventually be over in India and other nations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roseline Oluwaseun Ogundokun","author_inst":"Landmark University Omu Aran, Kwara State"},{"author_name":"Joseph Bamidele

of the ongoing clinical trials that are assessing various therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 with an aim to provide insight into the various interventions tested, clinical rationale, geographical distribution of the trials as well as the endpoints assessed in the studies. Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2. Data sources ClinicalTrials.gov, World health organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Cochrane COVID registry were assessed till May 11th 2020. Study selection Studies on any intervention based randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective clinical studies on SARS-CoV-2 in patients [&ge;]18 years of age. Studies on autopsy series, preclinical studies, diagnostic methods, mathematical modelling, epidemiology and health services research, pediatric populations were excluded. Data extraction The data was extracted by two authors independently into pre-defined forms based on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The data was extracted on various domains such as trial number, study title, abstract of the study, interventions assessed, sample size, phase of the study, study sponsor, primary endpoint assessed and country of study. Results The search resulted in 3242 ongoing studies of which 829 studies were included. There are 134 different drug-based interventions being assessed in 463 clinical trials as treatment options. Seventy-two studies assessed preventive options of which 53 are drug-based prophylaxis and 19 assessed vaccines. Herbal medicines are being assessed in 79 studies; convalescent plasma therapy in 56 studies; stem cell based interventions in 42 studies; anesthesia-based interventions in 31 studies, machine-based interventions in 24 studies, mental health- based interventions in18 studies, rehabilitation based interventions in 12 studies and miscellaneous interventions in 32 studies. China accounts for 35% of all ongoing clinical studies followed by USA 23%, France 7%, Spain 3.3%,Canada 2%, multi-country studies account only for 1.5% (13) and other countries together account for 28%.Amongst the 463 studies assessing drug-based treatment options, studies that are funded by federal and academic institutions are 79.6%, pharmaceutical company funded studies are 15.11% and no funding information is available in 5.10%. The definitive outcomes like mortality are being assessed as primary outcome in 22.8% of the studies only and need for ventilator in 6.2% of the studies. Rest of the studies has primary outcomes such as clinical recovery (15.9%), viral clearance(17.4%), time to recovery (10.1%), oxygen improvement (5.6%), ICU admission (1.9%), lab and imaging(6.4%), adverse effects (5.3%) and symptom reduction(1.5%),no outcome reported(6.2%) which account for 71% of the studies. Amongst the pharmaceutical company funded drug-based studies, only 20% of the studies had mortality as the primary outcome. Only 5.5% of the ongoing clinical trials are specifically designed to assess the most vulnerable population like elderly, patients with comorbidities and cancer. The most common intervention being tested against COVID-19 are antimalarial medications with 105 clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine is the most common drug being tested with 83 ongoing studies. Conclusion Multiple intervention based clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2 are being performed throughout the world with a high concentration of clinical trials in the developed world. There is a high concern that most of the studies maybe repetitive; elderly and patients with comorbidities are being underrepresented; definite endpoints like mortality are being assessed in only one-fifth of the studies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhanu Prasad Venkatesulu","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital"},{"author_name":"Viveksandeep Thoguluva

detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples is the standard method for diagnosis. These tests are centralised and therefore turnaround times can be 2-5 days. Point-of-care testing with rapid turnaround times would allow more effective triage in settings where patient management and infection control decisions need to be made rapidly. Methods: Analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test was evaluated on panels and residual clinical samples. The clinical performance was compared to the Public Health England reference tests. Results: The limit of detection of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test is 250 cp\/mL and is specific for detection of 2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The clinical sensitivity was evaluated in 172 clinical samples provided by Public Health England, Cambridge, which showed a sensitivity of 98.9% (95% CI 94.03-99.97%), specificity of 100% (95% CI 95.55-100%), PPV of 100% and NPV of 98.78% (92.02-99.82%) compared to testing by Public Health England (PHE). SAMBA detected 3 positive samples that were initially negative by PHE. Discussion: The data shows that the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test performs equivalently to the centralised testing methods with a much quicker turnaround time. Point of care testing, such as SAMBA, should enable rapid patient management and effective implementation of infection control measures.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonny M

Design It was carried out a descriptive transversal study in the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco state, Brazil, within the period of 20\/02\/2020 to 05\/05\/2020. Data included all official reports for influenza-like illness notified by the municipality health department and the self-reports collected through the participatory surveillance platform Brasil Sem Corona. Methods We used linear regression and loess regression to verify a correlation between Participatory Surveillance (PS) and Traditional Surveillance (TS) . Also a spatial scanning approach was deployed in order to identify risk clusters for COVID-19. Results In Caruaru, the PS had 861 active users, presenting an average of 1.2 reports per user per week. The platform Brasil Sem Corona started on March 20th and since then, has been officially used by the Caruaru health authority to improve the quality of information from the traditional surveillance system. Regarding the respiratory syndrome cases from TS, 1,588 individuals were positive for this clinical outcome. The spatial scanning analysis detected 18 clusters and 6 of them presented statistical significance (p-value < 0.1). Clusters 3 and 4 presented an overlapping area that was chosen by the local authority to deploy the COVID-19 serology, where 50 individuals were tested. From there, 32% (n=16) presented reagent results for antibodies related to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Onicio Batista Leal Neto","author_inst":"Department of

the variations in COVID-19 related mortality and incidence rates in relation to the time differences in the commencement of virus circulation and containment measures in different countries of the European Region. Methods: The data for the current analysis (N=50 countries) were retrieved from the John Hopkins University dataset on the 7th of May 2020, with countries as study units. A piecewise regression analysis was conducted with mortality and cumulative incidence rates introduced as dependent variables and time interval (days from the 22nd of January to the date when 100 first cases were reported) as the main predictor. The country average life expectancy at birth was statistically adjusted for in the regression model. Results: Mortality and incidence were strongly and inversely intercorrelated with days from January 22, respectively -0.83 (p<.0001) and -0.73 (p<.0001). Adjusting for average life expectancy, between days 33 to 50 from the 22th of the January, the average mortality rate decreased by 30.4\/million per day (95% CI: 23.2, 37.1, p<0.0001). During interval 51 to 73 days, the change in mortality was no longer statistically significant but still showed a decreasing trend. A similar relationship with time interval was found in incidence. Life expectancy was not associated with mortality rate. Conclusion: Countries in Europe which observed the earliest COVID-19 circulation, suffered the worst consequences in terms of health outcomes, specifically mortality. The drastic social isolation measures, undertaken especially in Eastern European countries, where community circulation started after March 11th, may have been timely. This may explain their significantly lower COVID-related mortality compared with the Western European countries.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alban Ylli","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health; Univeresity of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yan Yan Wu","author_inst":"Office of Public Health Studies, University of Honolulu at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA"},{"author_name":"Genc Burazeri","author_inst":"Department of International Health, School CAPHRI (Care and Public Health Research Institute), Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands; Department of"},{"author_name":"Catherine M.

SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in human tissues. ACE2 expression may be associated with COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Routinely prescribed drugs which up- or down-regulate ACE2 expression are therefore of critical research interest as agents which might promote or reduce risk of COVID-19 infection in a susceptible population. Aim: To review evidence on routinely prescribed drug treatments in the UK that could up- or down-regulate ACE2 and potentially affect COVID-19 infection. Design and setting: Systematic review of studies published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science from inception to April 1st 2020. Method: A systematic review will be conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria will be: i) assess effect of drug exposure on ACE2 level; ii) drug is included in British National Formulary (BNF) and therefore available to prescribe in UK; iii) a control, placebo or sham group is included as comparator. Exclusion criteria will be: i) ACE2 measurement in utero; ii) ACE2 measurement in children under 18 years; iii) drug not in BNF; iv) review article. Quality will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies, and the SYRCLE risk of bias tool for animal studies. Results: Data will be reported in summary tables and narrative synthesis. Conclusion: This systematic review will identify drug therapies which may increase or decrease ACE2 expression. This might identify medications increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission, or as targets for intervention in mitigating transmission.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hajira

the most common comorbidity associated with mortality in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This has been related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as animal studies indicate that these medications increase levels of ACE2, the cellular entry point for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has prompted clinicians to recommend discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs. Objective To examine the effect of ACEIs or ARBs treatment on serum levels of ACE2 and other key enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Design, Setting, and Participants A single center population-based study of 5457 Icelanders from the Age, Gene\/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) of the elderly (mean age 75+\/-6 years) stratified by ACEIs (N = 699) or ARBs (N = 753) treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures The AGES-RS study population was stratified by ACEIs and ARBs medication use and compared for age, body mass index (BMI) (kg\/m2), hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as serum levels of renin, ACE and ACE2. Results While renin and ACE levels were significantly raised in serum of individuals on ACEIs or ARBs treatments, the ACE2 levels remained unaffected. Conclusions and Relevance Treatment with ACEIs or ARBs does not raise ACE2 levels in serum. Therefore, the present study does not support the proposed discontinuation of these medications among patients affected with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valur

some parts of the United Kingdom more than others. Dumfries and Galloway (D&G) has seen fewer hospitalised cases than predicted. We wondered whether this might be related at least in part to population density. Methods We compared Covid-19 hospitalisation rates\/100,000 population in D&G with those of the other 10 mainland Scottish health boards. We chose two time points: 19th April which was the peak of the pandemic in Scotland and 15th May, seven and a half weeks after lockdown. We used chi square and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to test for differences in hospitalisation rates and Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the relation between hospitalisation rates and population density. Population density for each health board was provided by National Records of Scotland. Results Hospitalisation in D&G was 13.4\/100,000 on 19th April, falling to 1.3\/100,000 by 15th May. Corresponding hospitalisation rates in Greater Glasgow & Clyde (GGC) were 50.1\/100,000 and 38.9\/100,000. Compared to GGC, hospitalisation rates in D&G were 3 times lower at peak (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17, 0.42) and 30 times lower by 15th May (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01, 0.14). Hospitalisation rates for the other health boards lay in between values recorded for D&G and GGC and fell in 10 of the 11 boards between these two dates. There was a positive association between hospitalisation rate and population density (r=0.756, p=0.007 on 19th April and r=0.840, p<0.001 for 15th May). Conclusion We have confirmed there are large differences in Covid-19 hospitalisation rates across the 11 mainland Scottish health boards, that are in part related to population density. These data support a regional rather than one nation approach to easing Covid-19 restrictions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Rideout","author_inst":"Department of Public

To determine sources of variation between countries in per-capita mortality from COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). Methods. Potential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, sex, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of infection, lockdowns, viral testing, contact tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. Results. In univariate analyses, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of infection in the country, and the proportion of the population 60 years of age or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, while duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all p<0.001). International travel restrictions and a lower prevalence of obesity were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Internal lockdown requirements and viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. The association of contact tracing policy with mortality approached statistical significance (p=0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 15.8% each week, as compared with 62.1% each week in remaining countries. Conclusions. Societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T Leffler","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University"},{"author_name":"Edsel B Ing","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Joseph D.

COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that has spread from person to person throughout the world. Geographical disease surveillance is a powerful tool to monitor the spread of epidemics and pandemic, providing important information on the location of new hot-spots, assisting public health agencies to implement targeted approaches to minimize mortality. Methods County level data from January 22-April 28 was downloaded from USAfacts.org to create heat maps with ArcMapTM for diagnosed COVID-19 cases and mortality. The data was analyzed using spatial and space-time scan statistics and the SaTScanTM software, to detect geographical cluster with high incidence and mortality, adjusting for multiple testing. Analyses were adjusted for age. While the spatial clusters represent counties with unusually high counts of COVID-19 when averaged over the time period January 22-April 20, the space-time clusters allow us to identify groups of counties in which there exists a significant change over time. Results There were several statistically significant COVID-19 clusters for both incidence and mortality. Top clusters with high rates included the areas in and around New York City, New Orleans and Chicago, but there were also several small rural clusters. Top clusters for a recent surge in incidence and mortality included large parts of the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic Region, and several smaller areas in and around New York and New England. Conclusions Spatial and space-time surveillance of COVID-19 can be useful for public health departments in their efforts to minimize mortality from the disease. It can also be applied to smaller regions with more granular data. Keywords: Clusters, prospective space-time analysis, spatial analysis, COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raid Amin","author_inst":"University of West

The international cooperation involving indigenous peoples and local communities is urgently required in joint prevention to control the epidemic. Currently, many indigenous populations are continuing to face COVID 19. This study is concerned about the dynamic of COVID 19 pandemic among indigenous populations living in the remote Amazon rainforest enclaves. Using the Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model, the spread of the COVID 19 under 3 intervention scenarios (low, moderate, high) is simulated and predicted in indigenous tribe populations. The SIR model forecasts that without intervention, the epidemic peak may reach within 10 20 days. Nonetheless the peak can be reduced with strict interventions. Under low intervention, the COVID 19 cases are reduced to 73% and 56% of the total populations. While, in the scenario of high intervention, the COVID 19 peaks can be reduced to values ranging from 53% to 15% .To conclude, the simulated interventions tested by SIR model have reduced the pandemic peak and flattened the COVID 19 curve in indigenous populations. Nonetheless, it is mandatory to strengthen all mitigation efforts, reduce exposures, and decrease transmission rate as possible for COVID 19 containment.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrio Adwibowo","author_inst":"University of Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Terri Hall","author_inst":"University of West

studies have been conducted using 'infodemiological' methods in COVID-19 research, but studies focusing to examine the extent of infodemic monikers (misinformation) on the internet is very limited. Aim: We aimed to investigate the internet search behavior related to COVID-19 and the extent of infodemic monikers circulating in Google and Instagram during the pandemic period in the world. Methods: Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags (#), we explored the internet search activities and behaviors related to COVID-19 pandemic all over the world from February 20, 2020, to May 06, 2020. Briefly, we investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and also information related to the adoption of infodemic monikers related to COVID-19. We computed the average peak volume (APC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) during the study period. Results: The top five COVID-19 related terms used in Google searches were \"coronavirus\", \"corona\", \"COVID\", \"virus\", \"corona virus\", and \"COVID-19\". Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases have greater Google searches queries related to COVID-19. \"coronavirus ozone\", \"coronavirus laboratory\", \"coronavirus 5G\", \"coronavirus conspiracy\" and \"coronavirus bill gates\" are widely circulated infodemic monikers on the internet. Searches related to 'tips and cures' to COVID-19 spiked when the US president suggested an unproven drug as a 'miracle cure' and suggested injecting disinfectant to treat COVID-19. Around two-thirds (66.1%) of the Instagram users use \"COVID-19\", and \"coronavirus\" hashtags to disperse the information related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Globally, there is a growing interest in COVID-19 and a large number of infodemic monikers are circulating on the internet. Therefore, mass media regulators and health organizers should be vigilant to diminish the infodemic monikers dispersing on the internet and also should take serious actions against those spreading misinformation in social media.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessandro Rovetta","author_inst":"Mensana srls"},{"author_name":"Akshaya Srikanth

identify the range of filtering respirators that can be used in patient care and synthesise evidence to guide the selection and use of different respirator types. Design Comparative analysis of international standards for filtering respirators and rapid review of their performance and impact in healthcare. Data sources Websites of international standards organisations, Medline and EMBASE (final search 11th May 2020), with hand-searching of references and citations. Study selection Guided by the SPIDER tool, we included studies whose sample was healthcare workers (including students). The phenomenon of interest was respirators, including disposable and reusable types. Study designs including cross-sectional, observational cohort, simulation, interview and focus group. Evaluation approaches included test of respirator performance, test of clinician performance or adherence, self-reported comfort and impact, and perceptions of use. Research types included quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. We excluded studies comparing the effectiveness of respirators with other forms of protective equipment. Data extraction, analysis and synthesis Two reviewers extracted data using a template. Suitability for inclusion in the analysis was judged by two reviewers. We synthesised standards by tabulating data according to key criteria. For the empirical studies, we coded data thematically followed by narrative synthesis. Results We included relevant standards from 8 authorities across Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australasia. 39 research studies met our inclusion criteria. There were no instances of comparable publications suitable for quantitative comparison. There were four main findings. First, international standards for respirators apply across workplace settings and are broadly comparable across jurisdictions. Second, effective and safe respirator use depends on proper fitting and fit-testing. Third, all respirator types carry a burden to the user of discomfort and interference with communication which may limit their safe use over long periods; studies suggest that they have little impact on specific clinical skills in the short term but there is limited evidence on the impact of prolonged wearing. Finally, some clinical activities, particularly chest compressions, reduce the performance of filtering facepiece respirators. Conclusion A wide range of respirator types and models is available for use in patient care during respiratory pandemics. Careful consideration of performance and impact of respirators is needed to maximise protection of healthcare workers and minimise disruption to the delivery of care.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Burton","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Briana Coles","author_inst":"University of

countries worldwide to administer quarantine policies. However, each country or state decides independently what mobility restrictions to administer within its borders, while aiming to maximize its own citizens' welfare. In turn, since individuals travel between countries and states, at least during periods when quarantines are less restrictive, the policy in one country may ultimately affect the infection level in other countries. Therefore, major questions are whether the policy dictated by a decentralized government is efficient, and if not, how the governments can coordinate a better policy. Here, we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing the quarantines. We consider a game theory model in which each of two governments decides when to switch from a restrictive to a non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We used parameter values driven by the literature and publically available data. We show that, if travel is sufficiently frequent during the non-restrictive quarantine periods, then the strategies are sub-optimal: Each governor tends to release the quarantine sooner, which ultimately leads to longer periods of restrictive quarantines and a higher prevalence of the disease. In turn, if the governments restrict international and interstate travel to a low level even when the quarantines are non-restrictive, the policy dictated by the decentralized governance may become optimal.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam Lampert","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Briana Coles","author_inst":"University of

growth pattern of Covid-19 pandemic in India from March 4th to July 11th using regression analysis (exponential and polynomial), auto-regressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) model as well as exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters smoothing models. We found that the growth of Covid-19 cases follows a power regime of (t^2,t..) after the exponential growth. We found the optimal change points from where the Covid-19 cases shift their course of growth from exponential to quadratic and then from quadratic to linear. After that, we saw a sudden spike in the course of the spread of Covid-19 and the growth moved from linear to quadratic and then to quartic, which is alarming. We have also found the best fitted regression models using the various criteria such as significant p-values, coefficients of determination and ANOVA etc. Further, we search the best fitting ARIMA model for the data using the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and provide the forecast of Covid-19 cases for future days. It was noticed that the ARIMA model fits better the Covid-19 cases for small regions. ARIMA (5, 2, 5) and ARIMA (5, 2, 3) are the best possible models for modeling Covid-19 cases for March 4th to July 10th and June 1th to July 10th, respectively.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vikas Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"BHU, Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Unnati Nigam","author_inst":"BHU,Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Anil

COVID-19 pandemic as an estimate of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, their central role in media, official reports and decision-making may be undeserved and misleading. Previously published Infection Fatality Rates were weighted by age structure in the 50 countries with more reported deaths to obtain country-specific rates. For each country, the number of infections up to the Infection Date (23 days ago = Incubation Period + Onset to Death period) and the present percentage of immune population were estimated using Infection Fatality Rate, the number of reported deaths (which is less prone to undersampling), and projecting back to Infection Date. We then estimated a Detection Index for each country as the percentage of estimated infections that confirmed cases represent. Assuming that detection remains constant after Infection Date, we estimated the number of deaths and the estimated percentage of the population of each country expected to be immune up to 23 days into the future. Estimated Infection Fatality Rates are higher in Europe. In most countries, confirmed cases currently represent less than 30% of estimated infections on Infection Date, and this value decreases with time. Countries with flat curves throughout the pandemic show the lowest immunity percentages and these values seem unlikely to change in the near future, suggesting that they remain vulnerable to new outbreaks. Estimates for some countries with low Infection Fatality Rates suggest a still steep increase in the number of casualties in the next three weeks. Countries that did not control initial outbreaks seem to have reached higher immunity percentages, although mostly still under 5%. We provide the code to monitor the trajectories of these estimates in 178 countries throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rogelio Mac\u00edas-Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez","author_inst":"Instituto de Ecolog\u00eda, A.C."},{"author_name":"Dami\u00e1n Villase\u00f1or-Amador","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla"},{"author_name":"Bhakbhoom Panthan","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Krittikorn Kumpornsin","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Poramate Jiaranai","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Arporn Wangwiwatsin","author_inst":"Khon Kaen University"},{"author_name":"Namfon Kotanan","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Peera Jaruampornpan","author_inst":"National Science and Technology Development Agency"},{"author_name":"Treewat Watthanachockchai","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Kingkan Rakmanee","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Insee Sensorn","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Somnuek Sungkanuparph","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Ekawat Pasomsub","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Thanat Chookajorn","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Wasun Chantratita","author_inst":"Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Lilan Wen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Yuanjie Wei","author_inst":"Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health-Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jianfen Zhuo","author_inst":"Becton Dickinson Medical Devices (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Yingying Zhao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangz"},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Wei","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Dingbin Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Xinmei Zhang","author_inst":"Becton Dickinson Medical Devices (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Na Zhong","author_inst":"Becton Dickinson Medical Devices (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Yaling Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"He Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health-Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jinyong Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Wang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangz"},{"author_name":"Ruchong Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Xinwen Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangz"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jinxian Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jiekai Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health-Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
