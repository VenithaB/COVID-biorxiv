Here we show that four major factors likely accounted for the entire dynamics of COVID-19 in Brazil. Mathematical modeling revealed that, initially, the \"super-spreading\" city of Sao Paulo accounted for roughly 80% of the case spread in the entire country. During the first 3 months of the epidemic, by adding only 16 other spreading cities, we accounted for 98-99% of the cases reported in Brazil at the time. Moreover, 26 of the major Brazilian federal highways accounted for about 30% of SARS-CoV-2's case spread. As cases accumulated rapidly in the Brazilian countryside, the distribution of COVID-19 deaths began to correlate with a third parameter: the geographic distribution of the country's hospital intensive care unit (ICU) beds, which is highly skewed towards state capitals where the epidemic began. That meant that severely ill patients living in the countryside had to be transported to state capitals to access ICU beds where they often died, creating a \"boomerang effect\" that contributed to the skew of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 deaths. Finally, we discovered that the geographic distribution of dengue fever, amounting to more than 3.5 million cases from January 2019 to July 2020, was highly complementary to that of COVID-19. This was confirmed by the identification of significant negative correlations between COVID-19's incidence, infection growth rate, and mortality to the percentage of people with antibody (IgM) levels for dengue fever in each of the country's states. No such correlations were observed when IgM data for chikungunya virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector as dengue, was used. Thus, states in which a large fraction of the population had contracted dengue fever in 2019-2020 reported lower COVID-19 cases and deaths, and took longer to reach exponential community transmission, due to slower SARS-CoV-2 infection growth rates. This inverse correlation between COVID-19 and dengue fever was further observed in a sample of countries around Asia and Latin America, as well as in islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This striking finding raises the intriguing possibility of an immunological cross-reactivity between DENV serotypes and SARS-CoV-2. If proven correct, this hypothesis could mean that dengue infection or immunization with an efficacious and safe dengue vaccine could produce some level of immunological protection for SARS-CoV-2, before a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 becomes available.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel A.

This fundamental epidemiological parameter is still unknown for the recently-emerged COVID-19, and mathematical models have predicted very divergent results. Population studies using antibody testing to infer total cumulative infections can provide empirical evidence of the level of population immunity in severely affected areas. Here we show that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus, located in the Brazilian Amazon, increased quickly during March and April and declined more slowly from May to September. In June, one month following the epidemic peak, 44% of the population was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, equating to a cumulative incidence of 52%, after correcting for the false-negative rate of the antibody test. The seroprevalence fell in July and August due to antibody waning. After correcting for this, we estimate a final epidemic size of 66%. Although non-pharmaceutical interventions, plus a change in population behavior, may have helped to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Manaus, the unusually high infection rate suggests that herd immunity played a significant role in determining the size of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lewis F Buss","author_inst":"Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias & Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Augusto Prete Jr.","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia MM Abrahim","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mendrone Jr.","author_inst":"Fundacao Pro-Sangue -

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high-risk of exposure. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with Covid-19, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. Results: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18) and for twice weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng\/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng\/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19 (154 ng\/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng\/mL; P=0.08). Conclusions: Pre-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine once or twice weekly did not significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or Covid-19-compatible illness among healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ananta S Bangdiwala","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Melanie R Nicol","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Caleb P Skipper","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Katelyn A Pastick","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Margaret L Axelrod","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Matthew F Pullen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Alanna A Nascene","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Darlisha A Williams","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicole W Engen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Okafor","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Brian I Rini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ingrid A Mayer","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Peter Li","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Justin M Balko","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Dunlop","author_inst":"Hennepin Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.17.20196436","rel_title":"Comparison of COVID-19 outcomes among shielded and non-shielded populations: A general population cohort study of 1.3 million","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.17.20196436","rel_abs":"Background Shielding (extended self-isolation) of people judged, a priori, to be at high-risk from COVID-19 has been used by some countries to protect the individuals and reduce demand on health services. It is unclear how well this strategy works in either regard. Methods A general population study was conducted using linked primary care, prescribing, laboratory, hospital and death records up to end of May 2020. Poisson regression models and population attributable fractions were used to compare COVID-19 outcomes by overall risk category, and individual risk criteria: confirmed infection, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, population mortality and case-fatality. Results Of the 1.3 million population, 32,533 (2.47%) had been advised to shield, a further 347,374 (26.41%) were classified as moderate risk. Testing for COVID-19 was more common in the shielded (6.75%) and moderate (1.99%) than low (0.72%) risk categories. Referent to low-risk, the shielded group had higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 7.91, 95% 7.01-8.92), case-fatality (RR 5.19, 95% CI 4.12-6.53) and population mortality (RR 48.64, 95% 37.23-63.56). The moderate risk had intermediate risk of confirmed infection (RR 4.11, 95% CI 3.82-4.42) and population mortality (RR 26.10, 95% CI 20.89-32.60), but had comparable case-fatality (RR 5.13, 95% CI 4.24-6.21) to the shielded, and accounted for a higher proportion of deaths (PAF 75.27% vs 13.38%). Age [&ge;]70 years made the largest contribution to deaths (49.53%) and was associated with an 8-fold risk of infection, 7-fold case-fatality and 74-fold mortality. Conclusions Shielding has not been effective at preventing deaths in those with highest risk. To be effective as a population strategy, shielding criteria would need to be widely expanded to include other criteria, such as the elderly.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"David J Lowe","author_inst":"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"},{"author_name":"Sean MacBride-Stewart","author_inst":"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Matthew F Pullen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Alanna A Nascene","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Darlisha A Williams","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicole W Engen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Okafor","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Brian I Rini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ingrid A Mayer","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Peter Li","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Justin M Balko","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Dunlop","author_inst":"Hennepin Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.17.20196444","rel_title":"COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 MORTALITY IN BRAZIL, RIO DE JANEIRO, CAMPOS DOS GOYTACAZES, MACAE, CABO FRIO AND RIO DAS OSTRAS","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.17.20196444","rel_abs":"Objective: To analyze quantitatively and comparatively the deaths by COVID-19 of the four largest municipalities in the North of Rio de Janeiro and Baixada Litoranea of Rio de Janeiro, within the national context.

Results: We characterized the evolution of the pandemic. We found an exponential dependence on the mortality rate by age and a higher lethality in the male population. We determined that COVID-19 represents an important fraction of the causes of death in 2020, being associated with a significant excess of deaths in relation to 2019 and also with the change in mortality patterns due to other causes.

We hypothesize that, in addition to viral load and host antibody repertoire, host genetic variants also impact vulnerability to infection. Here we apply human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models and CRISPR-engineering to explore the host genetics of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4702), common in the population at large, and located in the 3'UTR of the protease FURIN, impacts alveolar and neuron infection by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Thus, we provide a proof-of-principle finding that common genetic variation can impact viral infection, and so potentially contribute to clinical heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing genetic studies will help to better identify high-risk individuals, predict clinical complications, and facilitate the discovery of drugs that might treat disease.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristina Dobrindt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daisy A Hoagland","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carina Seah","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bibi Kassim","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marina Iskhakova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Fernando","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"PJ Michael Deans","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Samuel K Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Behnam Javidfar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aleta Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Cyril Peter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moeller","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meilin Fernandez Garcia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"John Crary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Darrell Kotton","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Laura Huckins","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Schahram Akbarian","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.300913","rel_title":"Rapid detection of inter-clade recombination in SARS-CoV-2 with Bolotie","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.300913","rel_abs":"The ability to detect recombination in pathogen genomes is crucial to the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis and consequently to forecasting the spread of infectious diseases and to developing therapeutics and public health policies.

We applied our method to a large collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discovered hundreds of isolates that are likely of a recombinant origin. In cases where raw sequencing data was available, we were able to rule out the possibility that these samples represented co-infections by analyzing the underlying sequence reads. Our findings further show that several recombinants appear to have persisted in the population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ales Varabyou","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Pockrandt","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Steven Lloyd Salzberg","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Mihaela Pertea","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Marina Iskhakova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Fernando","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"PJ Michael Deans","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Samuel K Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Behnam Javidfar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aleta Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Cyril Peter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moeller","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meilin Fernandez Garcia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"John Crary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Darrell Kotton","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Laura Huckins","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Schahram Akbarian","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.306837","rel_title":"Baseline T cell immune phenotypes predict virologic and disease control upon SARS-CoV infection","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.306837","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes in humans, from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe disease that can require mechanical ventilation. An incomplete understanding of immune correlates of protection represents a major barrier to the design of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to prevent infection or limit disease. This deficit is largely due to the lack of prospectively collected, pre-infection samples from indiviuals that go on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized data from a screen of genetically diverse mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) infected with SARS-CoV to determine whether circulating baseline T cell signatures are associated with a lack of viral control and severe disease upon infection. SARS-CoV infection of CC mice results in a variety of viral load trajectories and disease outcomes. Further, early control of virus in the lung correlates with an increased abundance of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells prior to infections across strains. A basal propensity of T cells to express IFNg and IL17 over TNFa also correlated with early viral control. Overall, a dysregulated, pro-inflammatory signature of circulating T cells at baseline was associated with severe disease upon infection. While future studies of human samples prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 are required, our studies in mice with SARS-CoV serve as proof of concept that circulating T cell signatures at baseline can predict clinical and virologic outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection. Identification of basal immune predictors in humans could allow for identification of individuals at highest risk of severe clinical and virologic outcomes upon infection, who may thus most benefit from available clinical interventions to restrict infection and disease.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Graham","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jessica Swarts","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sophia Jeng","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Darla R Miller","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael Mooney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Shannon McWeeney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Martin T.

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking this site via neutralizing antibody or nanobody could prove an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elhan Taka","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Sema Zeynep Yilmaz","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Mert Golcuk","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Ceren Kilinc","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Umut Aktas","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Yildiz","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Mert Gur","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Darla R Miller","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael Mooney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Shannon McWeeney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Martin T.

CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein that can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022 interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to considerable flexibility of the RBD. In one of these conformations, quaternary interactions are made by CR3022 to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of an adjacent subunit. Overall, this study provides insights into antigenic variation and potential for cross-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-like viruses.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas C.

To better understand the genetic determinants of susceptibility of ACE2 orthologs to viral entry, we compared koala and mouse ACE2 sequences with human ortholog, and identified the key residues in koala or mouse ACE2 that restrict its viral receptor activity. Humanization of these critical residues could render the capabilities of koala and mouse ACE2 to bind viral spike protein and facilitate the viral entry. Our work identifies the genetic determinant of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and a single mutation could restore the mouse ACE2 receptor activity, providing a potential avenue for the development of mouse model of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenlin Ren","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Gaowei Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Zhao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Shi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yunkai Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Wu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Devin J.

Therefore, we have started studying on the characteristics of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to know about the truth of infectious disease and our future. After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term (isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the \"helium ash particle loss term\" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation control time parameter q and have studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this proposed method. To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density. We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer. We consider this isolation time control might be the only solution to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Osamu Mitarai","author_inst":"Institute for Advanced Fusion & Physics Education"},{"author_name":"Nagato Yanagi","author_inst":"National Institute for Fusion Science"},{"author_name":"Gaurab Mukherjee","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Monica S McAndrews","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Elissa J Chesler","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Judith A Blake","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanduo Zheng","author_inst":"National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing; Tsinghua Institute of Multidisciplinary Biomedical Research, Tsinghua University, 102206 Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Jianping Wu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Devin J.

The value of routinely testing staff treating cancer patients is not known. Methods: Patient-facing oncology department staff at work during the COVID-19 pandemic consented to have a nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 antigen test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blood tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using a laboratory Luminex-based assay and a rapid point-of-care (POC) assay on 2 occasions 28 days apart in June and July 2020. Results 434 participants were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%) and administrators (10.1%). 82% were female; median age 40-years (range 19-66). 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1.4% tested PCR-positive prior to June 2020. All were PCR-negative at both study day 1 and 28. 18.4% were SARS-CoV-2 sero-positive on day 1 by Luminex, of whom 42.5% also tested positive by POC. 47.5% of Luminex sero-positives had antibodies to both nucleocapsid (N) and surface (S) antigens. Nurses (21.3%) and doctors (17.4%) had higher prevalence trends of Luminex sero-positivity compared with administrators (13.6%) and radiographers (8.9%) (p=0.2). 38% of sero-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 1.9-fold higher odds than sero-negative participants (p=0.01). 400 participants re-tested on day 28: 13.3% were Luminex sero-positive of whom 92.5% were previously positive and 7.5% newly positive. Nurses (16.5%) had the highest seroprevalence trend amongst staff groups (p=0.07). 32.5% of day 1 sero-positives became sero-negative by day 28: the majority being previously reactive to the N-antigen only (p<0.0001). Conclusion The high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG sero-positivity in oncology nurses, and the high decline of positivity over 4 weeks supports regular antigen and antibody testing in this staff group for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine patient care prior to availability of a vaccine.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M Favara","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Karen McAdam","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Peterborough City Hospital, North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough"},{"author_name":"Anthony Cooke","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Laboratories, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Bordessa-Kelly","author_inst":"School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Ieva Budriunaite","author_inst":"Tissue Typing Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Sophie Bossingham","author_inst":"Tissue Typing Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Sally Houghton","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Rainer Doffinger","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola Ainsworth","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Kings Lynn NHS Foundation Trust, Kings Lynn, UK"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Yimin Tong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190256","rel_title":"Commercial COVID-19 serial seroconversion panel for validation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays","rel_date":"2020-09-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190256","rel_abs":"Background: Seroconversion panels (SCP) are an important tool for investigating antibody responses and developing serological assays.

The relationship of initial Ct at hospitalization and patient mortality has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study of all SARS-CoV-2 positive, hospitalized patients from 3\/26\/2020 to 8\/5\/2020 who had SARS CoV-2 Ct data within 48 hours of admission (n=1044). Only patients with complete survival data discharged (n=774) or died in hospital (n=270), were included in our analysis. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to examine the relationship of patient mortality with Ct values while adjusting for established risk factors. Ct values were analyzed both as continuous variables and subdivided into quartiles to better illustrate their relationship with outcomes, and other covariates. Cumulative incidence curves were created to assess whether there was a survival difference in the setting of the competing risks of death versus patient discharge. In this cohort the mean Ct at admission was higher for survivors (28.6, SD=5.8) compared to non-survivors (24.8, SD=6.0, P<0.001). Patients with a lower Ct value on admission were found to have a higher odds ratio (0.91, CI 0.89-0.94, p<0.001) of in hospital mortality after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and history of hypertension and diabetes. Patients with Ct values in 3rd Quartile (Ct 27.4-32.8) and 4th Quartile (Ct >32.9) have a lower odds of in-hospital death (P<0.001) in comparison to the 1st Quartile. On comparing between Ct quartiles, the mortality, BMI and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were significantly different (p<0.05) between the groups. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and discharge was found to differ between Ct quartiles (Grays Test P<0.001 for both.) Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 Ct at admission was found to be an independent predictor of in patient mortality. However, further study is needed on how to best clinically utilize such information given the result variation due to specimen quality, phase of disease, and the limited discriminative ability of the test.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jui Choudhuri","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Carter","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Randin Nelson","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Karin Skalina","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marika Osterbur-Badhey","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Johnson","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Doctor Y Goldstein","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Monika Paroder","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Szymanski","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Yimin Tong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.19.20196915","rel_title":"The Effects of Indias COVID-19 Lockdown on Critical Non-COVID Health Care and Outcomes","rel_date":"2020-09-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.19.20196915","rel_abs":"Indias COVID-19 lockdown is widely believed to have disrupted critical health services, but its effect on non-COVID health outcomes is largely unknown.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of postgraduate dental learners and instructors about the transition to distance learning, including the changes to the learning and teaching and its efficaciousness. A mixed-methods approach to research was utilized. All the instructors and postgraduate learners were invited to participate in the online survey. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses on SPSS for Windows version 25.0, and for the responses to the open-ended questions, multi-staged Thematic Analysis was utilized. Both groups of stakeholders: learners and instructors, were quite satisfied with the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19. Instructors were significantly more satisfied than the learners. The stakeholders adapted well to the change. The perception of the stakeholders regarding the case-based scenarios significantly influenced their level of satisfaction. As perceived by the stakeholders, the transition to distance learning entailed advantages and challenges. Going through the experience equipped the stakeholders with lessons learned and enabled them to develop informed opinions of how best to sustain learning and teaching irrespective of how matters unfold in relation to the pandemic. In conclusion, the worldwide dental education community faced unprecedented challenges due to the onset of COVID-19. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, it is important for decision-makers not to miss-out on the worthwhile opportunities, inherent in the experience, to reinforce curriculums, and maximize the learning and teaching.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatemeh Amir Rad","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farah Otaki","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zaid baqain","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nabil Zary","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Manal Al-Halabi","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashed University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Andrew Johnson","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Doctor Y Goldstein","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Monika Paroder","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Szymanski","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Yimin Tong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.18.302901","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 suppresses host but not viral translation through a bipartite mechanism","rel_date":"2020-09-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.18.302901","rel_abs":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that underlies the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5 UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5 UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ming Shi Sr.","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Longfei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pietro Fontana","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Setu Vora","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School,"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Min Fu","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Judy Lieberman","author_inst":"Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Wu","author_inst":"Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"James Szymanski","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Yimin Tong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.18.304493","rel_title":"An immunodominance hierarchy exists in CD8+ T cell responses to HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes identified from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-09-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.18.304493","rel_abs":"COVID-19 vaccines are being rapidly developed and human trials are underway. Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-{gamma}-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three pattern types that varied sequentially, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nImportanceFor the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.

The evolutionary conservation of the s2m element and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role in the viral infection cycle. In order to exploit this element as a potential therapeutic target, we have designed antisense \"gapmer\" oligonucleotides that efficiently base-pair to the s2m region. These oligonucleotides, composed of locked nucleic acids (LNA) flanking a central DNA core, successfully remodel the s2m structure and induce sequence-specific RNA cleavage by RNase H in vitro. Gapmers are also effective in human cells as they reduce the fluorescence signal in GFP reporter assays and cause a dose-dependent reduction in replication in a model replicon system based on a human astrovirus. Overall, these oligonucleotides show promise as anti-viral agents and may serve as a helpful starting point to develop treatments for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valeria Lulla","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michal P Wandel","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna J Bandyra","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tom Dendooven","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Xiaofei Yang","author_inst":"John Ines Centre"},{"author_name":"Nicole Doyle","author_inst":"Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Oerum","author_inst":"CNRS\/Univ Paris Diderot"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.16.300970","rel_title":"Introduction of two prolines and removal of the polybasic cleavage site leads to optimal efficacy of a recombinant spike based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the mouse model","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.16.300970","rel_abs":"The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the prime target for vaccine development. The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike proteins are large trimers that are relatively instable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 to prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus spikes. Here, we test multiple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike protein with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, the proline mutations, a combination thereof, as well as the wild type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the PP mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.\n\nImportanceA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validates the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutation and suggests that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site could lead to a further optimized design.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shirin Strohmeier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Raveen Rathnasinghe","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Schotsaert","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lynda Coughlan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garc\u00eda-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20193987","rel_title":"Death associated with coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in individuals with severe mental disorders in Sweden during the early months of the outbreak - a exploratory cross-sectional analysis of a population-based register study","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20193987","rel_abs":"Background: Individuals with severe mental disorder (SMD) have a higher risk of somatic comorbidity and mortality than the rest of the population. We set up a population-based study to assess whether individuals with SMD had a higher risk of death associated with a COVID-19 infection (COVID-19 associated death) than individuals without SMD. Methods: Exploratory analysis with a cross-sectional design in the framework of a population-based register study covering the entire Swedish population. The Swedish Board for Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) provided anonymised tabulated summary data for further analysis. We compared numbers of COVID-19 associated death in individuals with SMD (cases) and without SMD (controls). We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for the whole sample and by age group and four potential risk factors, namely diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease. Results: The sample comprised of 7,923,859 individuals, 103,999 with SMD and 7,819,860 controls. There were 130 (0.1%) COVID-19 associated deaths in the SMD group and 4945 (0.06%) in the control group, corresponding to an OR of 1.98 (CI 1.66-2.35; p < 0.001). The odds were fourfold in the age group between 60 and 79 years. Cardiovascular diseases increased the odds by 50%. Individuals with SMD without any of the risk factors under study had three-folds odds of COVID-19 associated death. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that individuals with SMD are a further group at increased risk of COVID-19 associated death. The factors contributing to this increased mortality risk require clarification.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Maripuu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Psychiatry, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Marie Bendix","author_inst":"Dep of Clinical Sciences, Div of Psychiatry, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden; Dep of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Centre for Psychiatry Research "},{"author_name":"Louise \u00d6hlund","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Psychiatry, Sunderby Research Unit, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Micael Widerstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ursula Werneke","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Psychiatry, Sunderby Research Unit, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garc\u00eda-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20165886","rel_title":"Genetically proxied inhibition of interleukin-6 signaling: opposing associations with susceptibility to COVID-19 and pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20165886","rel_abs":"The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is pivotal for orchestrating the immune response.

Design Cost-effectiveness analysis. Participants We used societal data and COVID-19 mortality rates from the public domain. Interventions The intervention was a strict lockdown strategy that has been followed by Denmark. Reference strategy was flexible social distancing policy as was applied by Sweden. We derived mortality rates from COVID-19 national statistics, assumed the expected life years lost from each COVID-19 death to be 11 years and calculated lost life years until 31st August 2020. Expected economic costs were derived from gross domestic productivity (GDP) statistics from each country's official statistics bureau and forecasted GDP. The incremental financial costs of the strict lockdown were calculated by comparing Sweden with Denmark using externally available market information. Calculations were projected per one million inhabitants. In sensitivity analyses we varied the total cost of the lockdown (range -50% to +100%). Main outcome measure Financial costs per life years saved. Results In Sweden, the number of people who died with COVID-19 was 577 per million inhabitants, resulting in an estimated 6,350 life years lost per million inhabitants. In Denmark, where a strict lockdown strategy was installed for months, the number of people dying with COVID-19 was on average 111 per million, resulting in an estimated 1,216 life years per million inhabitants lost. The incremental costs of strict lockdown to save one life year was US$ 137,285, and higher in most of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Comparisons of public health interventions for COVID-19 should take into account life years saved and not only lost lives. Strict lockdown costs more than US$ 130,000 per life year saved. As our all our assumptions were in favour of strict lockdown, a flexible social distancing policy in response to COVID19 is defendable.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ben W.

Several national and state-level studies conducted predict the course of the pandemic using machine learning algorithms, most common being the SIR and the Logistic models. However, it is unclear whether these models work for a controlled community like Municipal Corporation or not. With measures now being employed at Municipal levels in India, it only fits to conduct particular research to examine how these models perform at lower jurisdictions. This study provides concrete evidence to show the superiority of the modified SIR model over the Logistic model based on analysis. The models not only give accurate predictions for up to 14 days but can also be used to define and signify the practicality and effectiveness of the decisions taken by the authorities. This feature of the study allows us to justly say that the government action of Unlock 1.0 was not a wise decision considering the nature of the pandemic. This study hopes to help the authorities to take the proper actions to prevent any further aggravation of the spreading virus.

To date, the disease has infected more than 18 million people with over 690k deaths reported. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to difficulty in annotation efforts of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input a several patient CT slices (considered as a bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in latent space, and spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity in features from the same patient against pooled patient features. Empirical results show our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%. Moreover, ablation studies show the benefit of contrastive learning with MIL.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip Chikontwe","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Miguel Luna","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Myeongkyun Kang","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Kyung Soo Hong","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"June Hong Ahn","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"Sang Hyun Park","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194548","rel_title":"Non-stationary Spatio-Temporal Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in The U.S.","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194548","rel_abs":"The fast transmission rate of COVID-19 worldwide has made this virus the most important challenge of year 2020. Many mitigation policies have been imposed by the governments at different regional levels (country, state, county, and city) to stop the spread of this virus. Quantifying the effect of such mitigation strategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of new daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes the spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19 progression. Specifically, a piecewise susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is developed while the dates at which the transmission\/recover rates change significantly are defined as \"break points\" in this model. A novel and data-driven algorithm is designed to locate the break points using ideas from fused lasso and thresholding. In order to enhance the forecasting power and to describe additional temporal dependence among the daily number of cases, this model is further coupled with spatial smoothing covariates and vector auto-regressive (VAR) model. The proposed model is applied to several U.S. states and counties, and the results confirm the effect of \"stay-at-home orders\" and some states' early \"re-openings\" by detecting break points close to such events. Further, the model performed satisfactorily short-term forecasts of the number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated spatio-temporal covariance structures. Finally, some theoretical results and empirical performance of the proposed methodology on synthetic data are reported which justify the good performance of the proposed method.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yue Bai","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Abolfazl Safikhani","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"George Michailidis","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Kyung Soo Hong","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"June Hong Ahn","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Regional Center for Respiratory Diseases, Yeungnam University Medical Center, College of M"},{"author_name":"Sang Hyun Park","author_inst":"DGIST"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Randow","author_inst":"MRC LMB"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"William Scott","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Yiliang Ding","author_inst":"John Innes Centre"},{"author_name":"Andrew Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kotryna Bloznelyte","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Luisi","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194696","rel_title":"First detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the vicinity of COVID-19 isolation centre through wastewater surveillance in Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194696","rel_abs":"In the course of a COVID-19 pandemic, 0.33 million people got infected in Bangladesh, we made the first and successful attempt to detect SARS-CoV-2 viruses' genetic material in the vicinity wastewaters of an isolation centre i.e. Shaheed Bhulu Stadium, situated at Noakhali. The idea was to understand the genetic loading variation, both temporal and distance-wise in the nearby wastewater drains when the number of infected COVID-19 patients is not varying much. Owing to the fact that isolation center, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on gene detection concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains.
