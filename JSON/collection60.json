The Middle East has a death toll of [~]50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over 350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19.\n\nMethodsThe approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).\n\nFindingsWe identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East.\n\nInterpretationThe phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants affecting in the region than any other study.\n\nFundingNone","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khalid M Bindayna","author_inst":"Arabian Gulf University"},{"author_name":"Shane Crinion","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics, National University of Ireland, Galway,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.08.332080","rel_title":"Batch-Corrected Distance Mitigates Temporal and Spatial Variability for Clustering and Visualization of Single-Cell Gene Expression Data","rel_date":"2020-10-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.08.332080","rel_abs":"Clustering and visualization are essential parts of single-cell gene expression data analysis. The Euclidean distance used in most distance-based methods is not optimal. Batch effect, i.e., the variability among samples gathered from different times, tissues, and patients, introduces large between-group distance and obscures the true identities of cells. To solve this problem, we introduce Batch-Corrected Distance (BCD), a metric using temporal\/spatial locality of the batch effect to control for such factors. We validate BCD on a simulated data as well as applied it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset. We also found the utility of our approach in understanding the progression of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). BCD achieves more accurate clusters and better visualizations than state-of-the-art batch correction methods on longitudinal datasets. BCD can be directly integrated with most clustering and visualization methods to enable more scientific findings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaoheng Liang","author_inst":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuang Dou","author_inst":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ramiz Iqbal","author_inst":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ken Chen","author_inst":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.08.330456","rel_title":"idCOV: a pipeline for quick clade identification of SARS-CoV-2 isolates","rel_date":"2020-10-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.08.330456","rel_abs":"idCOV is a phylogenetic pipeline for quickly identifying the clades of SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates from raw sequencing data based on a selected clade-defining marker list.

With an increased infection and transmission rate, it is imperative to determine whether antibodies induced against the D614 isolate may cross-neutralize against the G614 variant. In this report, profiling of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity reveals similar neutralization profiles against both S protein variants, albeit waning neutralizing antibody capacity at the later phase of infection. These findings provide further insights towards the validity of current immune-based interventions.\n\nIMPORTANCERandom mutations in the viral genome is a naturally occurring event that may lead to enhanced viral fitness and immunological resistance, while heavily impacting the validity of licensed therapeutics. A single point mutation from aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) at position 614 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, termed D614G, has garnered global attention due to the observed increase in transmissibility and infection rate. Given that a majority of the developing antibody-mediated therapies and serological assays are based on the S antigen of the original Wuhan reference sequence, it is crucial to determine if humoral immunity acquired from the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate is able to induce cross-detection and cross-protection against the novel prevailing D614G variant.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheryl Yi-Pin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Siti Naqiah Amrun","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network"},{"author_name":"Rhonda Sin-Ling Chee","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Yun Shan Goh","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Tze Minn Mak","author_inst":"National Public Health Laboratory, National Centre for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sophie Octavia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Yeo","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Zi Wei Chang","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network-A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zirui Tay","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Anthony Torres","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Carissimo","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Chek Meng Poh","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network-BMSI-A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Siew-Wai Fong","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Bei Wang","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network"},{"author_name":"Sandy Lee","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Young","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Seow Yen Tan","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yee Sin Leo","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Disease"},{"author_name":"David Chien Boon Lye","author_inst":"National Centre of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Raymond TP Lin","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Maurer-Stroh","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Institute"},{"author_name":"Bernett T.

The effect of sex, however, has been overlooked in past modelling approaches of COVID-19 infections. Aim: The aim of our study is to develop an age- and sex-specific model of COVID-19 transmission and to explore how contact changes effect COVID-19 infection and death rates. Method: We consider a compartment model to establish forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the compartments are subdivided into different age groups and genders. Estimated contact patterns, based on other studies, are incorporated to account for age- and sex-specific social behaviour. The model is fitted to real data and used for assessing hypothetical scenarios with regard to lockdown measures. Results: Under current mitigation measures as of mid-August, active COVID-19 cases will double by the end of October 2020. Infection rates will be highest among the young and working ages, but will also rise among the old. Sex ratios reveal higher infection risks among women than men at working ages; the opposite holds true at old age. Death rates in all age groups are twice as high among men as women. Small changes in contact rates at working and young ages may have a considerable effect on infections and mortality at old age, with elderly men being always at higher risk of infection and mortality. Discussion: Our results underline the high importance of the non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures in the current phase of the pandemic to prevent that an increase in contact rates leads to higher mortality among the elderly. Gender differences in contact rates, in addition to biological mechanisms related to the immune system, may contribute to sex-specific infection rates and their mortality outcome. To further explore possible pathways, more data on COVID-19 transmission is needed which includes socio-demographic information.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Achim Doerre","author_inst":"University of Rostock"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Doblhammer","author_inst":"University of Rostock"},{"author_name":"Diksha Attrish","author_inst":"Dr. B.

COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for the patients. Inclusion criteria: This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in emergency trauma surgery. Methods: We will conduct several searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Critical appraisal of the eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardized data extraction tool in Covidence.

We simulate the possible impact of; social distancing, quarantining, curfew and cross-county travel restriction, lockdown of selected cities in Kenya and quarantining. We varied interventions in terms of start dates, duration of implementation and effectiveness of the interventions. We estimated the outcomes in terms of number of possible infections, recoveries and deaths. With the current state of interventions, we estimated a peak of Covid-19 in September 2020 with an estimated 13.5 Million Covid-19 cases and 33.8 thousand deaths in Kenya. The largest possible reduction in infections and mortality was achievable through increase in the effectiveness of the interventions. The suggested interventions would delay the epidemic peak of Covid-19 to between late Nov 2020 and early December 2020 with an estimated13M cases a 500 thousand reduction in Covid-19 cases and 32.4 deaths( a reduction in 1400 deaths).

Results: The mean age of the 108 patients was 55.5 (SD: 15.4) years and 27.8% were health-care workers; 75.9% presented some type of symptoms, with dyspnoea being the most common. A D-dimer >500 ng\/mL was detected in 32 (31.4%) patients. All the patients had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Being a health-care worker was associated with symptom persistence, with age [&ge;]65 years being a protective factor. Conclusions: The persistence of symptoms in patents with COVID is usual 12 weeks after the acute episode, especially in patients <65 years and health-care workers. All our patients had developed antibodies by 12 weeks.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Valiente-De Santis","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Ines Perez-Camacho","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Sobrino","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Gracia Eugenia Gonzalez","author_inst":"University Regional Hospital of Malaga"},{"author_name":"Juan Diego Ruiz-Mesa","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Antonio Plata","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Marquez-Gomez","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Lidia Cobos","author_inst":"University Regional Hospital of Malaga"},{"author_name":"Marcial Delgado-Fernandez","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Manuel Castano","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Francisco Onate","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Francisco Orihuela","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Begona Palop","author_inst":"University Regional Hospital of Malaga"},{"author_name":"Jose Maria Reguera","author_inst":"IBIMA"},{"author_name":"Murtaza Tambuwala","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science, Ulster University, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Northern Ireland, UK"},{"author_name":"Gajendra Kumar Azad","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Patna University, Patna-800005, Bihar, India"},{"author_name":"Samendra P.

The clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood. Methods: Adults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb. Results: Amongst 250 consecutive persons studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243\/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers [&ge;]1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03\/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses. Conclusions: Nab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing. Functional nAb levels were found to decline and a small proportion of COVID-19 survivors lack adaptive immune responses.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jim Boonyaratanakornkit","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinon Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chihiro Morishima","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Stacy Selke","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danniel Zamora","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah McGuffin","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Adrienne E Shapiro","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Victoria L Campbell","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Christopher L McClurkan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lichen Jing","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Robin Gross","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Janie Liang","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Elena Postnikova","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Steven Mazur","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Anu Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Marie K Das","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Susan L Fink","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bryan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alex L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Michael R Holbrook","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Terry B Gernsheimer","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark H Wener","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Anna Wald","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"David M Koelle","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lisa F.

Given the authorized nationwide use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin in COVID-19 patients, we aimed to evaluate their effectiveness alone or combined to reduce 30-day mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients without life-threatening illness. Methods: Design. Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records to emulate a target trial. Settings. Nationwide data of mid- and high-level complexity hospitals from the Peruvian Social Health Insurance (EsSalud) between April 1 and July 19, 2020. Participants. Patients 18 years old and above with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, and no diagnosis of severe disease at admission. Interventions. Five treatment groups, hydroxychloroquine\/chloroquine alone (HCQ), ivermectin alone (IVM), azithromycin alone (AZIT), HCQ + AZIT group, and IVM + AZIT within 48 hours of admission at doses recommended by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Comparison. Standard of care treatment without receiving any of the mentioned drugs within 48 of admission. Outcomes: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate, and secondary outcomes were survival without death or ICU transfer, and survival without death or oxygen prescription. Analysis. Analysis were adjusted for confounding factors using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Propensity scores were estimated using machine learning boosting models. Weighted hazard ratios (wHR) were calculated using Cox regression Results: Among 5683 patients, 200 received HCT, 203 IVM, 1600 AZIT, 692 HCQ + AZIT, 358 IVM + AZIT, and 2630 received standard of care. The AZIT + HCQ group was associated with 84% higher all-cause mortality hazard rate compared to standard care (wHR=1.84, 95%CI 1.12-3.02). Consistently, AZIT + HCQ treatment was associated with deaths or ICU transfer ICU (wHR=1.49, 95%CI 1.01-2.19), and deaths or oxygen prescription (wHR=1.70, 95%CI 1.07-2.69). HCQ treatment was only associated with death or oxygen prescription (wHR=1.77, 95% CI 1.01-3.11), and IVM was only associated with death or ICU transfer (wHR=1.58, 95%CI 1.11-2.25). No effect was found for AZIT or AZIT + IVM. Conclusion: Our study reported no beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, or their combinations.

The primary endpoint was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. Results: A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c < 69 mg\/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein > 88 mg\/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia < 1000 cells\/ml (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2\/FiO2 or P\/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients. Methods We selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2 patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P\/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P\/F ratio of participants. Results The initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg\/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg\/L after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg\/L, which decreased to 43.82 mg\/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P\/F ratio (p<0.05), and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p<0.05). Conclusion Steroids have ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P\/F ratio in COVID-19 patients. Physicians should consider the use of dexamethasone use in appropriate patients with COVID-19.

Method: We analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and August 2020 and online surveys on mental health among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Results: Compared to the last three years (2017-2019), the number of suicide deaths was lower during the initial phase of the pandemic but subsequently exceeded the past trend. By August 2020, the total number of suicides was 5.69% higher than the average number of suicides in the same month of the previous three years. The largest increase was found in suicides by young women (less than 40 years of age), with a 40% increase in August 2020 compared to the same month in the past three years. The number of suicides among students and housekeepers in summer months was notably larger in 2020. The survey data indicated that the status of mental health among young women was worse than that of women in other age groups. In addition, young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss in recent months compared to any other groups, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding some of these young female workers. Conclusion: Our results strongly indicate that continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michiko Ueda","author_inst":"Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Robert Nordstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Tetsuya Matsubayashi","author_inst":"Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Rizwan Pervaiz","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Saleem","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Faisal Munir","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muneeb Ullah Saif","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Raul Fuertes","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina.

SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We reported downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma ACE2 activity. In this prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes and increased plasma ACE2 activity. Methods We measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay in a cohort of Australians aged 18 years and over who had recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR testing) (n=66) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples were available in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. Results Plasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days] was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol\/min\/ml, p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in plasma ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive had higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (p<0.0001). We next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection. Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects, with no significant differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p>0.05). Discussion This is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after COVID-19 infection, and the first with longitudinal data indicating plasma ACE2 activity remains elevated out to a median of 114 days post- infection. Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistent elevated plasma ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sheila K Patel","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Juno","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"P Mark Hogarth","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi Lee","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise M Burrell","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muneeb Ullah Saif","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Raul Fuertes","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina.

Facemask use has been qualitatively associated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but no study has quantitatively assessed the impact of government mask mandates (MM) on new COVID-19 cases across multiple US States. Data and Methods: We utilized a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm to test the a priori hypothesis that MM were associated with reductions in new COVID-19 cases. Publicly available data were used to analyze new COVID-19 cases from 37 States and the District of Columbia (i.e., \"38 States\"). We conducted confirmatory All-States and State-Wise analyses, validity analyses [e.g., leave-one-out (LOO) and bootstrap resampling], and covariate analyses. Results: No statistically significant difference in the daily number of new COVID-19 infections was discernible in the All-States analysis. In State-Wise LOO validity analysis, 11 States exhibited reductions in new COVID-19 and the reductions in four of these States (AK, MA, MN, VA) were significant in bootstrap resampling. Only the Social Capital Index predicted MM success (training p<0.028 and LOO p<0.013). Conclusion: Results obtained when studying the impact of MM on COVID-19 cases varies as a function of the heterogeneity of the sample being considered, providing clear evidence of Simpson's Paradox and thus of confounded findings. As such, studies of MM effectiveness should be conducted on disaggregated data. Since transmissions occur at the individual rather than at the collective level, additional work is needed to identify optimal social, psychological, environmental, and educational factors which will reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate MM effectiveness across diverse settings.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael J Maloney","author_inst":"Proof School"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel James Rhodes","author_inst":"Midwestern University"},{"author_name":"Paul R Yarnold","author_inst":"Optimal Data Analysis, LLC"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi Lee","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise M Burrell","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muneeb Ullah Saif","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Raul Fuertes","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina.

Once interior districts were infected a positive feedback dynamics emerge creating regions of high reproducibility of the virus where interventions may be focus in the very near future.

Several studies are evaluating the importance of analyzing viral load in different types of samples, clinical outcomes and viral transmission pathways. However, in a great number of emerging studies cycle threshold (Ct) values by itself is often used as a viral load indicator, which may be a mistake. In this study, we compared tracheal aspirate with nasopharyngeal samples obtained from critically ill COVID-19 patients and demonstrate how the raw Ct could lead to misinterpretation of results. Further, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs positive samples and propose a method to reduce evaluation error that could occur from using raw Ct. Based on these findings, we show the impact that normalization of Ct values has on interpretation of viral load data from different biological samples from patients with COVID-19, transmission and lastly in relations with clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renan Lyra Miranda","author_inst":"Neuropathology and Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Instituto Estadual do C\u00e9rebro Paulo Niemeyer"},{"author_name":"Alexandro Guterres","author_inst":"Instituto Estadual do C\u00e9rebro Paulo Niemeyer"},{"author_name":"Carlos Henrique de Azeredo Lima","author_inst":"Neuropathology and Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Instituto Estadual do C\u00e9rebro Paulo Niemeyer"},{"author_name":"Paulo Niemeyer Filho","author_inst":"Instituto Estadual do C\u00e9rebro Paulo Niemeyer"},{"author_name":"M\u00f4nica Roberto Gadelha","author_inst":"Neuropathology and Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Instituto Estadual do C\u00e9rebro Paulo Niemeyer"},{"author_name":"Louise M Burrell","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muneeb Ullah Saif","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Raul Fuertes","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina.

Although the Spike glycoprotein (SgP) of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to heparins, the structural features of this interaction, the role of a plausible heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptor, and the antagonism of this pathway through small molecules remain unaddressed. Using an in vitro cellular assay, we demonstrate HSPGs modified by the 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform-3, but not isoform-5, preferentially increased SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in comparison to control, unmodified, wild-type HSPGs. Computational studies support preferential recognition of the receptor-binding domain of SgP by 3-O-sulfated HS sequences. Competition with either fondaparinux, a 3-O-sulfated HS-binding oligopeptide, or a synthetic, non-sugar small molecule, blocked SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Finally, the synthetic, sulfated molecule inhibited fusion of GFP-tagged pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with human 293T cells with sub-micromolar potency.

To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens.

However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. In this study, we developed simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and fourplex (4 targets) assays based on a two color ddPCR system for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results showed that the fourplex assay had the similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical isolates demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug couldn't. Conclusively, our research shows that developing multiplex ddPCR assays is possible by combing probe mix and amplitude based multiplexing, which will help in developing multiplexed ddPCR assays for different SARS-CoV-2 applications.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raphael Nyaruaba","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Changchang Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Caroline Mwaliko","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Matilu Mwau","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nelson Odiwuor","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Elishiba Muturi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Caroline Muema","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Jin Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Junping Yu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Hongping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Scott W.

Structured agent-based models (ABMs) provide a means to investigate the efficacy of such strategies in heterogeneous populations and to explore the impact of factors such as changes in test turnaround times (TaT). Methods: We developed a structured ABM to simulate key SARS-CoV-2 transmission and Covid-19 disease progression dynamics in populations of 10,000 agents. We ran 10,000 simulations of each of three scenarios: (1) No CTI with a TaT of two days, (2) CTI with a TaT of two days, and (3) CTI with a TaT of eight days. We conducted a secondary analysis in which TaT values were varied from two to 11. The primary outcome for all analyses was mean total infections. Results: CTI reduced the mean number of infections from 5,577 to 4,157 (a relative reduction of 25.5%) when TaT was held steady at two days. CTI with a TaT of eight days resulted in a mean of 5,163 infections (a relative reduction of 7.4% compared to no CTI and a TaT of two days). In the secondary analysis, every additional day added to the TaT increased the total number of infections - with the greatest increase in infections between four and five days, and the smallest increase between ten and eleven days. Conclusions: In a structured ABM that simulates key dynamics of Covid-19 transmission and disease progression, CTI results in a substantial reduction in the mean number of total infections. The benefit is greater with shorter TaT times, but remained substantial even with TaTs of eight days. The results suggest that CTI may play a critical role in reducing the size of outbreaks and that TaTs should be kept as short as possible in order to maximise this benefit.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcus O Low","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Nathan Geffen","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Brandon F.

Phylogenetic analysis identified 8 global lineages and at least 76 independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Kenyan coast. The dominant B.1 lineage (European origin) accounted for 82.1% of the cases. Lineages A, B and B.4 were detected from screened individuals at the Kenya-Tanzania border or returning travellers but did not lead to established transmission. Though multiple lineages were introduced in coastal Kenya within three months following the initial confirmed case, none showed extensive local expansion other than cases characterised by lineage B.1, which accounted for 45 of the 76 introductions. We conclude that the international points of entry were important conduits of SARS-CoV-2 importations. We speculate that early public health responses prevented many introductions leading to established transmission, but nevertheless a few undetected introductions were sufficient to give rise to an established epidemic.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George Githinji","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Zaydah R deLaurent","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Khadija Said Mohamed","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Donwilliams O Omuoyo","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Peter M Macharia","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Nairobi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"John M Morobe","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Edward Otieno","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Samson M Kinyanjui","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Ambrose Agweyu","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Eric Maitha","author_inst":"Department of Health, Kilifi county"},{"author_name":"Ben Kitole","author_inst":"Department of Health, Kilifi county"},{"author_name":"Thani Suleiman","author_inst":"Department of Health, Mombasa county"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Mwakinangu","author_inst":"Department of Health, Kwale county"},{"author_name":"John Nyambu","author_inst":"Department of Health, Taita Taveta county"},{"author_name":"John Otieno","author_inst":"Department of Health, Lamu county"},{"author_name":"Barke Salim","author_inst":"Department of Health, Tana River county"},{"author_name":"Kadondi Kasera","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"John Kiiru","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Rashid Aman","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Government of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"Health Economics Research Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Nairobi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"George Warimwe","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Philip Bejon","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tsofa","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Lynette Isabella Ochola-Oyier","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"D James Nokes","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Charles N Agoti","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.02.20205674","rel_title":"Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.02.20205674","rel_abs":"Background The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to lead to a significant increase in mental health disorders amongst healthcare workers (HCW). Aims We evaluated the prevalence of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a HCW population in the United Kingdom (UK), to identify subgroups most at risk. Methods An electronic survey was conducted between the 05\/06\/2020 and 31\/07\/2020 of all hospital HCW in the West Midlands, UK using clinically validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations. Results There were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female: 79.5%, median age: 42 [IQR: 32-51] years). The prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were 34.3%, 31.2% and 24.5% respectively. In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.9-2.7]; p<0.001), depression (2.5 [2.1-3.0]; p<0.001) and PTSD (2.1 [1.7-2.5]; p<0.001). The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), wellbeing support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with former symptoms (p[&le;]0.001). Conclusions We report a high prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD in hospital HCW following the initial Covid-19 pandemic peak in the UK. Those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk. Adequate PPE availability, access to wellbeing support and reduced exposure to moral dilemmas may protect hospital HCW from mental health symptoms.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kasun Wanigasooriya","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Palimar","author_inst":"Forward Thinking Birmingham"},{"author_name":"David Naumann","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Khalida Ismail","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jodie L.

Although various reports on possible psychiatric side effects of these drugs exist, the nature and extent of these effects remain poorly understood. Moreover, the relevance of these drugs in the treatment of early stages of COVID-19 necessitates a careful estimation of their side effects. Here, we provide a systematic review of the psychiatric side effects associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to identify relevant literature published between 1962 and 2020. Search terms included chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, psychiatry, psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, delirium, and psychotic disorders. Only case reports and clinical trials were included. All studies included records of psychiatric side effects induced by either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or both. Both retrospective and prospective, randomized as well as non-randomized population studies were included. Overall, the psychiatric side effects are dose- and sex-independent. The most common psychiatric side effects reported are increased speech output\/ excessive talking, increased psychomotor activity, irritable mood, auditory hallucinations, delusion of grandiosity, and suicide attempts, likely due to brain intoxicationbe of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The symptoms can develop in a few hours to 11 weeks after drug intake and are normally reversed within a week after the drug withdrawal. We conclude that CQ and HCQ have the potential to induce psychiatric side effects. This study calls for further investigation of psychiatric symptoms induced by these drugs in the short and long term.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Talarico","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Sucheta Chakravarty","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Angrew Greenshaw","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Ives Passos","author_inst":"Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Psiquiatria e Ciencias do Comportamento, Laboratory of Molecular Psychiatry and Bipolar Disorder Program, Hospital de Clinicas de P"},{"author_name":"Bo Cao","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Christopher V.

We aimed at summarizing the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of social isolation and loneliness with physical and mental health. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone, and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social isolation and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarized in a narrative synthesis. Results: Twenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. A total of more than 3 million individuals had participated in the 692 primary studies. The results suggest that social isolation is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The existing evidence clearly indicates that social isolation is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nexhmedin Morina","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Ahlke Kip","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Thole H Hoppen","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Stefan Priebe","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meyer","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Bo Cao","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Christopher V.

This paper zooms in on business shutdowns and investigates their effectiveness in reducing mortality. We leverage upon highly granular death registry data for over 4,000 Italian municipalities in a diff-in-diff approach that allows us to credibly mitigate endogeneity concerns. Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that business shutdowns are very effective in reducing mortality. We calculate that the death toll from the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy would have been twice as high in their absence. Our findings also highlight that timeliness is key: by acting one week earlier, the government could have reduced the death toll by an additional 25%. Finally, our estimates suggest that shutdowns should be targeted: closing shops, bars and restaurants saves the most lives, while shutting down manufacturing and construction activities has only mild effects.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriele Ciminelli","author_inst":"Asia School of Business in collaboration with MIT Sloan"},{"author_name":"Silvia Garcia-Mandico","author_inst":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development"},{"author_name":"Thole H Hoppen","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Stefan Priebe","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meyer","author_inst":"University of Muenster"},{"author_name":"Bo Cao","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Christopher V.
