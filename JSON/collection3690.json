Cigarette smoke is a major etiological risk factor that has been shown to alter cellular processes involving mitochondrial function, cellular senescence and telomeric length. Here we determined how aging contribute to the alteration in the gene expression of above mentioned cellular processes that play an important role in the progression of COPD and IPF. We hypothesized that aging may differentially alter the expression of mitochondrial, cellular senescence and telomere genes in smokers and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers. Total RNA from human lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed based on their ages (younger: <55 yrs and older: >55 yrs). NanoString nCounter panel was used to analyze the gene expression profiles using a custom designed codeset containing 112 genes including 6 housekeeping controls (mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cellular senescence, telomere replication and maintenance). mRNA counts were normalized, log2 transformed for differential expression analysis using linear models in the limma package (R\/Bioconductor). Data from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD and IPF were analyzed based on the age groups (pairwise comparisons between younger vs. older groups). Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis\/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A) and telomere replication\/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and other quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases. Elderly patients with chronic lung disease and smokers were found to have high incidence and mortality rates in the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoblot analysis in the lung homogenates of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased protein abundance of important proteases and spike proteins like TMPRSS2, furin and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 levels. This may further strengthen the observation that smokers, COPD and IPF subjects are more prone to COVID-19 infection. Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition add to the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF and other smoking-related chronic lung disease in associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis for COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna P Maremanda","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Isaac Kirubakaran Sundar","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Irfan Rahman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130724","rel_title":"The inevitability of Covid-19 related distress among healthcare workers: findings from a low caseload country under lockdown","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130724","rel_abs":"Objectives: To characterize psychological distress and factors associated with distress in healthcare practitioners working during a stringent lockdown in a country (Jordan) with one of the lowest incidence rates of Covid-19 globally. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey sent to physicians, nurses and technicians, and pharmacists working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were potential sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the key outcome. Results: We surveyed 1,006 practitioners (55.3% females). Approximately 63%, 13%, 17% and 7% were nurses\/technicians, physicians, pharmacists, and other nonmedical personnel (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, perception of effective protective institutional measures, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician) and working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family\/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. Conclusion: Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professional resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feras Ibrahim Hawari","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nour A Obeidat","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yasmeen I Dodin","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Asma S Albtoosh","author_inst":"The University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Rasha M Manasrah","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim O Alaqeel","author_inst":"Ibn Alhaytham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Asem H Mansour","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130898","rel_title":"Covid-19 in Chile.

Aim: To report clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe and critical cases. Methods: Cases were identified by a compatible clinical picture associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied. Results: 21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients [&ge;]60 years old predominated (57.1%). Hypertension (61.9%), obesity (57.1%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1%) were prevalent but 19% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM\/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing were limited (19% at 1st week; 42.9% at 2nd week). Nine patients (42.9%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values. One pregnant woman required urgent cesarean section given birth to a premature neonate without vertical transmission. Two patients died (in-hospital mortality 9.5%) and length of stay was equal or higher than 14 days in 57.9% of patients. Conclusion: In our regional Center, Covid 19 was associated to known risk factors, had a prolonged stay and in-hospital mortality. Tachypnea [&ge;]30\/min is predictive of transfer to ICU.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe Olivares","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Daniel Munoz","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Alberto Fica","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Delama","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Ignacia Alvarez","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Maritza Navarrete","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Eileen Blackburn","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Pamela Garrido","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Juan Granjean","author_inst":"Hospital Base de Valdivia, Valdivia, Chile"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130617","rel_title":"Is tracking and modeling Covid-19 infection dynamics for Bangladesh using daily data feasible?","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130617","rel_abs":"Given the low Covid-19 testing coverage in the country, this study tested whether the daily change in the number of new Covid-19 cases is due to increase (or decrease) in the number of tests done daily.

However, there is no data about the best moment for its administration along the course of the disease. Methods We provided tocilizumab on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. Primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 hours of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous tocilizumab during March 8-2020, through April 20-2020. Findings A total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analysed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male. A co-existing condition was present in 68 % of cases. At baseline, 114 (61%) required oxygen support with FiO2 >0.5 % and 72 (39%) <0.5%. Early administration of tocilizumab, when the need of oxygen support was still below FiO2 <0.5%, was significantly more effective than given it in advanced stages (FiO2 >0.5 %), achieving lower rates of intubation or death (13% vs 37% repectively, p<0.001). Interpretation The benefit of tocilizumab in severe SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia is only expected when it is administrated before the need of high oxygen support.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Gorgolas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Cabello","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Laura Prieto Perez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Felipe Villar Alvarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Alvarez Alvarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Rodriguez Nieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Irene Carrillo Acosta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Itziar Fernandez Ormaechea","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Aws Al-Hayani","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Pilar Carballosa","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Silvia Calpena Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Farah Ezzine de Blas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marina Castellanos Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Alba Naya Prieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marta Lopez de las Heras","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marcel Jose Rodriguez Guzman","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ana Cordero Guijarro","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Antonio Broncano Lavado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Alicia Macias Valcayo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marta Martin Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Javier Becares Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Fernandez Roblas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Piris Pinilla","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Jose Fortes Alen","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Olga Sanchez Pernaute","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Fredeswinda Romero Bueno","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Sarah Heili Frades","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"German Peces Barba Romero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130666","rel_title":"Impact of weather indicators on the COVID-19 outbreak: A multi-state study in India","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130666","rel_abs":"The present study examines the impact of weather indicators on the COVID-19 outbreak in the majorly affected states of India.

The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 genes) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target genes in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC\/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC\/L for N2.

We performed a comprehensive systematic review to investigate the latest clinical evidence on the treatment efficacy and safety of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic search of the Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Google scholar, and MedRxiv for relevant observational and interventional studies. Measured outcomes were mortality rates, improvement rates, time to clinical improvement, all adverse event rates and severe adverse event rates. Results: 3 RCTs and 2 cohorts were included in our study. In 2 cohort studies, patients received Remdesivir for 10 days. 2 RCTs evaluated 10-day treatment of Remdesivir efficacy versus placebo group and the other RCT compared its 5-day regimen versus 10-day regimen. Visual inspection of the forest plots revealed that Remdesivir efficacy was not much different in reducing 28-day mortality versus 14-day mortality rates. Besides, 10-day treatment regimen overpowers 5-day treatment and placebo in decreasing time to clinical improvement. All adverse event rates did not have significant difference; however, severe adverse event rate was lower in 5-day Remdesivir group compared to 10-day and placebo groups. Conclusion: 5-day course of Remdesivir therapy in COVID-19 patients is probably efficacious and safe and patients without invasive mechanical ventilation benefit the most. Treatment can be extended to 10 days if satisfactory improvement is not seen by day 5. Most benefits from Remdesivir therapy take place in the first 14 days of the start of the treatment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirhossein Roshanshad","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Kamalipour","author_inst":"Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Ashraf","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Romina Roshanshad","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammadreza Akbari","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mark S.

To assist with the establishment of measures for the strategic planning to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, we present the first Brazilian geographic study with the aims to examine active hand emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19. We examine the associations between clusters and mortality rate, vulnerability, and social inequality. We used the prospective space-time scan statistic to detect daily COVID-19 clusters and examine the relative risk from February 25th-June 7th, 2020 in 5,570 Brazilian municipalities. We apply a Spearman statistic to measure correlation between the relative risk of each cluster and mortality rate, GINI index, and social inequality. We detected 11 emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 occurring in all Brazilian regions, with seven of them with a relative risk greater than one, and the highest in the Amapa state in the northern region of Brazil. We observed a positive and significant correlation between the relative risk and mortality rate, Brazilian Social Vulnerability Index, and GINI Index. The results can be utilized to improve COVID-19 response and planning in all Brazilian states.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcos Roberto Martines","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Vicente Ferreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro"},{"author_name":"Rogerio H Toppa","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Luiza Assuncao","author_inst":"State University of Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Michael Richard Desjardins","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eric M Delmelle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Aiyoub Pezeshgi","author_inst":"Zanjan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali A.

The time plot showed that the cases of COVID-19 rises rapidly in recent time. KPSS test confirms the non-stationarity of the process (p < 0.05) before differencing. The test also confirmed the stationarity of the process (p > 0.05) after differencing. Various ARIMA (p,d,q) were examined with their respective AICs and Log-likelihood. ARIMA (1, 2, 1) was selected as the best model due to its least AIC (559.74) and highest log likelihood (-276.87). Both Shapiro-Wilk test and Box test performed confirm the fitness of the model (p > 0.05) for the series. Forecast for 30 days was then made for COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide. Methods: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a previously described hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. Results: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. Conclusions: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model can be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Future research should primarily address the model's assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Levente Kriston","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Isqeel Adesegun Ogunsola","author_inst":"Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta"},{"author_name":"Saddam Adams Damisa","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University"},{"author_name":"Luiza Assuncao","author_inst":"State University of Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Michael Richard Desjardins","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eric M Delmelle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Aiyoub Pezeshgi","author_inst":"Zanjan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali A.

However, the potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through breastfeeding is currently unknown. To date, case reports on breastmilk samples from a total of 24 SARS-CoV-2-infected women have been published. Of those, viral RNA was detected in ten breastmilk samples from four women. In some but not all cases, environmental contamination as the source of the virus or retrograde flow from an infected infant could not be ruled out. We established a quantitative RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 in breastmilk with a limit of detection of 250 copies per mL and validated it by spiking breastmilk from uninfected women with known amounts of viral RNA. In addition, we established tissue culture methods to detect replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in breastmilk. No viral RNA nor culturable virus was detected after Holder pasteurization of breastmilk samples that had been spiked with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 (see Supplement). Between March 27 and May 6, 2020, we collected and analyzed 64 serial breastmilk samples from 18 SARS-CoV-2-infected women residing in the U.S. (see Supplement for clinical characteristics). Breastmilk samples were collected before and after women had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and all but one woman had symptomatic disease (see Figure). One of the 64 breastmilk samples had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The positive sample was collected on the day of symptom onset but one sample 2 days prior to symptom onset and two subsequent samples, collected 12 and 41 days later, tested negative for viral RNA. In addition, a subset of 26 breastmilk samples from nine women were tested for the presence of replication-competent virus using our established culture methods, and all were negative including the one sample that tested positive for viral RNA by RT-PCR. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one milk sample from one of eighteen infected women, the viral culture for that sample was negative. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not represent replication-competent virus and that breastmilk itself is likely not a source of infection for the infant. Furthermore, when control breastmilk samples spiked with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus were treated by Holder pasteurization, a process commonly performed by donor milk banks, no replication-competent virus nor viral RNA was detectable. Further research to confirm these findings is needed, as well as an examination of convalescent milk for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina D Chambers","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Paul Krogstad","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Kerri Bertrand","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Deisy Contreras","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Lars Bode","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Nicole Tobin","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Grace Aldrovandi","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Ali A.

The strategies for prevention depend on largely lacking information, as infection prevalence and virus pathogenicity. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, the pathogenicity, and the speed of infection spreading in a large population in Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a serial cross-sectional study designed on a population basis and structured over houses as the sampling units. The sampling consisted of four visits at 15 days intervals in randomly selected census-designated sectors of the State major municipalities (reference municipalities) and two visits at 30 days intervals in smaller municipalities of the same regions of those of reference. At each visit, the investigators sampled houses and sampled one individual in each house for data collection. After the informed consent, the investigators performed a rapid antibody detection test (Celer Technology, Inc) and applied a questionnaire containing clinical and demographic questions. RESULTS: From May 13th to 15th, the investigators performed 6,393 rapid tests in 4,612 individuals of the reference municipalities, 1,163 individuals of the smaller municipalities, and 166 contacts of the positive individuals. Ninety-seven dwellers were positive in the reference municipalities, giving a prevalence of 2.1% (CI 95%: 1.67-2.52%). In the smaller municipalities, the figure was 0.26% (CI 95%: 0.05%-0.75%) (three positives). There was an association of the positive result with female sex (p = 0.013) and houses with five dwellers or more (p = 0.003). Seventy-eight positive individuals reported symptoms in the previous 15 days (80.4%), being anosmia (45.4%), cough (40.2%), and myalgia (38.1%) the more frequent. About one-third of them reported fever (28.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a still small prevalence of infection in the study area, despite the significant number of sick people overloading the health system. The figures indicate an important underreporting in the area and a frequency that still can grow, making necessary public health actions for the containment of the transmission.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristiana Costa Gomes","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Crispim Cerutti Jr.","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Eliana Zandonade","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Ethel Leonor Noia Maciel","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Filomena Euridice Carvalho de Alencar","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Gilton Luiz Almada","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Orlei Amaral Cardoso","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Pablo Medeiros Jabor","author_inst":"Instituto Jones dos Santos Neves"},{"author_name":"Raphael Lubiana Zanotti","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Tania Queiroz Reuter","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo.

Here, we investigated the interaction between complement and the platelet\/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)\/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 clinical samples, cell-based inhibition studies and NETs\/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) co-cultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, TF activity and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils yielded high tissue factor (TF) expression and released NETs carrying functionally active TF. Confirming our ex vivo findings, treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAEC. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. Serum isolated from COVID-19 patients induces complement activation in vitro, which is consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement inhibition at the level of C3 with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis that reveals the pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immmunothrombosis. This study supports emerging strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection that exploit complement therapeutics or NETosis inhibition.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Alexandros Mitsios","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Akrivi Chrysanthopoulou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Dimitrios C Mastellos","author_inst":"National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Aghia Paraskevi, Athens, Greece."},{"author_name":"Simeon Metallidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"Petros Rafailidis","author_inst":"Second Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Ntinopoulou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Eleni Sertaridou","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Julien Lavigne du Cadet","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maxim Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julia S.

Design: This was a retrospective cohort study focusing on the clinical data of COVID-19 inpatients admitted at the early stage of pandemic. Setting: A single center study conducted in Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong university of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). Participants: All 1031 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Prevention and control Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia published by National Health Commission of the People' s Republic of China and WHO interim guidance in Tongji hospital (Wuhan, China), from January 27, 2020, to March 8, 2020 with the cutoff date being March 30, 2020, were included in this study. Main outcome measures: Demographic data, medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT), treatment, and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Results: 1031 COVID-19 inpatients were included in this study, of whom 866 were discharged and 165 were deceased in hospital. 73% of 165 deceased patients had chronic comorbidities. Patients with underlying diseases showed CFR 2.8 times as that of patients without. Senility and males were observed to be main risk factors for increased in-hospital case-fatality rate, with the odds ratio in multivariable regression being 2.94 (95%CI: 2.00 to 4.33; P <0.001) and 2.47 (95%CI: 1.65 to 3.70; P <0.001), respectively. The odds ratio of cases with composite endpoints for patients with simple hypertension was 1.53 (95%CI: 1.07 to 2.17; P=0.019). Senile patients with hypertension were proved to be at high risk early in the disease, which might be associated with the level of CRP, LDH, and eGFR. The odds ratio of case-fatality rate for patients with hypertension taking CCB group was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.37 to 1.20; P = 0.176). Among 271 severe cases without IKF, the odds ratio of case-fatality rate was 0.42 (95CI%: 0.18 to 0.99; P = 0.046) for patients in the CCB group after adjustment of age, sex, and underlying diseases. Conclusions: Hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity, but also a risk factor affecting the severity of COVID-19 and does play a critical role in worsening patients' clinical outcomes. Therefore, hypertension management in patients with COVID-19 should be regarded as a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hesong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tianlu Zhang","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xingwei He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuxin Du","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Tong","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xueli Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Central China Development, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Hypertension, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Julien Lavigne du Cadet","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maxim Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julia S.

We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of VTE sufferers. Results: Eight studies have been included with a total of 1237 pooled subjects. Venous thromboembolism was associated with higher mortality (RR 2.48 (1.35, 4.55), p=0.003; I2 5%, p=0.35) after we performed sensitivity analysis, ICU admission (RR 2.32 (1.53, 3.52), p<0.0001; I2 80%, p <0.0001), and mechanical ventilation need (RR 2.73 (1.56, 4.78), p=0.0004; I2 77%, p=0.001).

Crude CFRs could by biased by larger proportions of older COVID-19 cases in population data, who are also at increased mortality risk. Such distorted age case structures are a common feature of selective COVID 19 testing strategies in many countries, and they potentially mask underlying differences arising from other important factors such as health system burden. Methods We used the method of direct case-age standardisation to evaluate the effects of age variations on CFRs. Data on cases and death by age from Italy, Spain, China, Australia and South Korea were analysed to derive standardised CFRs. Findings were compared across different case age distribution references as standards. Results Using the South Korean case age distribution as a standard, the fivefold higher crude CFR for Italy is reduced to less than two-fold after adjustment, while the crude CFR difference for Spain is virtually eliminated. The adjusted CFR for Australia is the lowest among all countries. Discussion Mortality differences based on crude CFRs are exaggerated by age structures, which are effectively controlled by case age standardization. Residual CFR differences could be attributed to health and health system factors. The South Korean case age distribution is an appropriate reference standard, given its robust case detection and contact tracing program. Till reliable population level indicators of incidence and mortality are available, the age-standardized CFR could be a viable option for international comparison of the impact of the COVID 19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chalapati Rao","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Suhail Doi","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Gail Williams","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Hoo Felicia Hadi Gunawan","author_inst":"Siloam Hospitals Kebon Jeruk"},{"author_name":"Alius Cahyadi","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Paskah Suciadi","author_inst":"Siloam Hospitals Kebon Jeruk"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Hypertension, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Julien Lavigne du Cadet","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maxim Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julia S.

The extent and success of such measures has varied. Many jurisdictions with declines in reported COVID-19 cases are moving to relax measures, while others are continuing to intensify efforts to reduce transmission. Aim: We aim to determine the time frame between a change in COVID-19 measures at the population level and the observable impact of such a change on cases. Methods: We examine how long it takes for there to be a substantial difference between the cases that occur following a change in control measures and those that would have occurred at baseline. We then examine how long it takes to detect a difference, given delays and noise in reported cases. We use changes in population-level (e.g., distancing) control measures informed by data and estimates from British Columbia, Canada. Results: We find that the time frames are long: it takes three weeks or more before we might expect a substantial difference in cases given a change in population-level COVID-19 control, and it takes slightly longer to detect the impacts of the change. The time frames are shorter (11-15 days) for dramatic changes in control, and they are impacted by noise and delays in the testing and reporting process, with delays reaching up to 25-40 days. Conclusion: The time until a change in broad control measures has an observed impact is longer than is typically understood, and is longer than the mean incubation period (time between exposure than onset) and the often used 14 day time period. Policy makers and public health planners should consider this when assessing the impact of policy change, and efforts should be made to develop rapid, consistent real-time COVID-19 surveillance.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica E Stockdale","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Renny Doig","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Joosung Min","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Nicola Mulberry","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Liangliang Wang","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Lloyd T Elliott","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Julien Lavigne du Cadet","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maxim Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julia S.

Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity\/mortality\/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection. METHODS Data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/coronavirus\/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries' mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates. RESULTS Among those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS That data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery. BCG vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease-specific vaccine is developed, but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chuan-Hsin Chang","author_inst":"Academic Sinica"},{"author_name":"Yue-Cune Chang","author_inst":"Tamkang University"},{"author_name":"Joosung Min","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Nicola Mulberry","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Liangliang Wang","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Lloyd T Elliott","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Julien Lavigne du Cadet","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maxim Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julia S.

Remarkably, we found that during the first three weeks since disease onset, while clinical symptoms and outcome were indistinguishable, patients with prolonged disease course displayed characteristic immunological responses including enhanced Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated innate immunity and regulatory T cell-mediated immunosuppression. We further showed that it is possible to predict the length of disease course using machine learning based on blood protein levels during the first three weeks. Validation in an independent cohort achieved an accuracy of 82%. In summary, this study presents a rich serum proteomic resource to understand host responses in COVID-19 patients and identifies characteristic Treg-mediated immunosuppression in LC patients,

(e.g., fever, hyperventilation, anorexia, gastroenteritis, acid-base disorder) that may cause electrolyte imbalances. Hypokalemia is a concerning electrolyte disorder that may increase the susceptibility to various kinds of arrhythmia. This study aimed to estimate prevalence, risk factors and outcome of hypokalemia in a cohort of non-critically ill patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 290 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at the tertiary teaching hospital of Modena, Italy. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq\/L) was detected in 119 patients (41%). The decrease of serum potassium level was of mild entity (3-3.4 mEq\/L) and occurred in association with hypocalcemia (P=0.001) and lower level of serum magnesium (P=0.028) compared to normokaliemic patients. Urine K: creatinine ratio, measured in a small subset of patients (n=45; 36.1%), showed an increase of urinary potassium excretion in the majority of the cases (95.5%). Causes of kaliuria were diuretic therapy (53.4%) and corticosteroids (23.3%). In the remaining patients, urinary potassium loss was associated with normal serum magnesium, low sodium excretion (FENa< 1%) and metabolic alkalosis. Risk factors for hypokalemia were female gender (P=0.002; HR 0.41, 95%CI 0.23-0.73) and diuretic therapy (P=0.027; HR 1.94, 95%CI 1.08-3.48). Hypokalemia, adjusted for sex, age and SOFA score, resulted not associated with ICU admission (P=0.131, 95% CI 0.228-1.212) and in-hospital mortality (P=0.474; 95% CI 0,170-1,324) in our cohort of patients. Hypokalemia is a frequent disorder in COVID-19 patients and urinary potassium loss may be the main cause of hypokalemia. The disorder was mild in the majority of the patients and was unrelated to poor outcomes. Nevertheless, hypokalemic patients required potassium supplements to dampen the risk of arrhythmias.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaetano Alfano","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Annachiara Ferrari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Francesco Fontana","author_inst":"Policlinco di Modena"},{"author_name":"Rossella Perrone","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Mori","author_inst":"Policlinco di Modena"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Ascione","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Magistroni Riccardo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giulia Venturi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Simone Pederzoli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Margiotta","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marilina Romeo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Francesca Piccinini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Franceschi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Sara Volpi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Matteo Faltoni","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Ciusa","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Erica Bacca","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marco Tutone","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Raimondi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"marianna menozzi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Erica Franceschini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Cuomo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Orlando","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santoro","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Margherita Di Gaetano","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Puzzolante","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Federica Carli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bedini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Jovana Milic","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marianna Meschiari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cristina Mussini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianni Cappelli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guaraldi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20131128","rel_title":"Innate immune signaling in the olfactory epithelium reduces odorant receptor levels: modeling transient smell loss in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20131128","rel_abs":"Post-infectious anosmias typically follow death of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with a months-long recovery phase associated with parosmias. While profound anosmia is the leading symptom associated with COVID-19 infection, many patients regain olfactory function within days to weeks without distortions. Here, we demonstrate that sterile induction of anti-viral type I interferon signaling in the mouse olfactory epithelium is associated with diminished odor discrimination and reduced odor-evoked local field potentials. RNA levels of all class I, class II, and TAAR odorant receptors are markedly reduced in OSNs in a non-cell autonomous manner. We find that people infected with COVID-19 rate odors with lower intensities and have odor discrimination deficits relative to people that tested negative for COVID-19. Taken together, we propose that inflammatory-mediated loss of odorant receptor expression with preserved circuit integrity accounts for the profound anosmia and rapid recovery of olfactory function without parosmias caused by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steve Rodriguez","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital \/ Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Luxiang Cao","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gregory T.

Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are higher. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection may augment aging-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients.\n\nMethodologyWe performed a comparative analysis of publicly available transcriptome data from Broncho Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)\/lung\/blood of healthy aging group with i) COVID-19 patients; and ii) data of host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.\n\nResultsWe observed i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group respectively; ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and aging blood transcriptome.\n\nConclusionsPathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggests that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and co-morbidities. Furthermore, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases. This model based on a limited patient dataset seems robust and holds promise for testing larger tissue specific datasets from patients with varied severity and across populations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Upasana Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"BK Thelma","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gregory T.

Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. Since the risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age, we combined proteomics data from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with human gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to identify gene products involved in coagulation that change with age, differ in their levels between females and males, and are regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This resulted in the identification of transferrin as a candidate coagulation promoter, whose levels increases with age and are higher in males than in females and that is increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic investigation of gene products associated with the GO term \"blood coagulation\" did not reveal further high confidence candidates, which are likely to contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In conclusion, the role of transferrin should be considered in the course of COVID-19 disease and further examined in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katie-May McLaughlin","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Marco Bechtel","author_inst":"Goethe-University"},{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Goethe-University"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Goethe Universtiy Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Mark N Wass","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Martin Michaelis","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Jindrich N Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Alefiya Dhilla Albers","author_inst":"Endicott College \/ Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rose Gallagher","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

However, where is it origin and which animals are sensitive to cross-species transmission is unclear. The interaction of virus and cell receptor is a key determinant of host range for the novel coronavirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated as the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different species of animals, and discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Capra hircus (goat) and especially Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) were able to render SARS-CoV-2 entry in non-susceptible cells. This is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the presume that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. However, none of the ACE2 proteins from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry. Specifically, a natural isoform of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkey) ACE2 with a mutation of Y217N was resistance to infection, which rises the possible impact of this type of ACE2 during monkey studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results clarify that SARS-CoV-2 could engage receptors of multiple species of animals and it is a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and its intermediate hosts.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, we illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to engage receptors of multiple species of animals. This indicated that it may be a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and discover its intermediate hosts. This feature of virus is considered to potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility. Of note, here is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. And we also demonstrated that not all species of bat were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At last, it is also important to detect the expression ratio of the Y217N ACE2 to the prototype in Rhesus monkeys to be recruited for studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan-Dong Tang","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuming Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science"},{"author_name":"Jing Sun","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hongliang Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong-yun Wang","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ming-Xia Sun","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yue-Lin Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Hu","author_inst":"Yibin University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuehui Cai","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhifeng Ren","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Daniel Tatar","author_inst":"The ADK Group"},{"author_name":"Shibani Mukerji","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ross Zafonte","author_inst":"Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital"},{"author_name":"Edward W.
