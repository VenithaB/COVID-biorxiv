The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated. Objective: Identify factors associated with hospitalization and disease severity in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system from March 13, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for covariates was used to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19. Results: Among the 689 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 29.2% were non-Hispanic White, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 32.5% were Hispanic, and 12.8% were of other race\/ethnicity. About 31.3% of patients were hospitalized and 13.2% had severe disease. In adjusted analyses, the sociodemographic factors associated with hospitalization and\/or disease severity included older age, non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic race\/ethnicity (compared to non-Hispanic White), and smoking. The following comorbidities: diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, COPD, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and vitamin D deficiency were associated with hospitalization and\/or disease severity. Hematological disorders such as anemia, coagulation disorders, and thrombocytopenia were associated with both hospitalization and disease severity. Conclusion: This study confirms race and ethnicity as predictors of severe COVID-19. It also finds clinical risk factors for hospitalization and severe COVID-19 not previously identified such a vitamin D deficiency, hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, and anemia.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angelico Mendy","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology, Department of Environmental and Public Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA"},{"author_name":"Senu Apewokin","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anjanette A Wells","author_inst":"School of Social Work, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Ardythe L Morrow","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology, Department of Environmental and Public Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie Gansauge","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Philipp Kanis","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Dominik Macak","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Stephan Riesenberg","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Lukas Bokelmann","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Hugo Zeberg","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Matthias Meyer","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Stephan Borte","author_inst":"Hospital St. Georg"},{"author_name":"Svante Paabo","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20140442","rel_title":"Population heterogeneity is a critical factor of the kinetics of the COVID-19 epidemics","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20140442","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus pandemic generates extensive attention in political and scholarly domains.

In reality, people differ in the propensity to catch the infection and spread it further. Here, we incorporate population heterogeneity into the Kermack-McKendrick SIR compartmental model and show the cost of the pandemic may be much lower than usually assumed. We also indicate the crucial role of correctly planning lockdown interventions. We found that an efficient lockdown strategy may reduce the cost of the epidemic to as low as several percents in a heterogeneous population. That level is comparable to prevalences found in serological surveys. We expect that our study will be followed by more extensive data-driven research on epidemiological dynamics in heterogeneous populations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dalkhat M.

In particular, lockdown and related social distancing policies are motivated in some countries by the need to slow virus propagation - so that the primary wave of patients suffering from severe forms of COVID infection do not exceed the capacity of intensive care units. But unlocking poses a critical issue because relaxing social distancing may, in principle, generate secondary waves. Ironically however, the dynamic repertoire of established epidemiological models that support this kind of reasoning is limited to single epidemic outbreaks. In turn, predictions regarding secondary waves are tautologically derived from imposing assumptions about changes in the so-called \"effective reproduction number\". In this work, we depart from this approach and extend the LIST (Location-Infection-Symptom-Testing) model of the COVID pandemic with realistic nonlinear feedback mechanisms that under certain conditions, cause lockdown-induced secondary outbreaks. The original LIST model captures adaptive social distancing, i.e. the transient reduction of the number of person-to-person contacts (and hence the rate of virus transmission), as a societal response to salient public health risks. Here, we consider the possibility that such pruning of socio-geographical networks may also temporarily isolate subsets of local populations from the virus. Crucially however, such unreachable people will become susceptible again when adaptive social distancing relaxes and the density of contacts within socio-geographical networks increases again. Taken together, adaptive social distancing and network unreachability thus close a nonlinear feedback loop that endows the LIST model with a mechanism that can generate autonomous (lockdown-induced) secondary waves. However, whether and how secondary waves arise depend upon the interaction with other nonlinear mechanisms that capture other forms of transmission heterogeneity. We apply the ensuing LIST model to numerical simulations and exhaustive analyses of regional French epidemiological data. We find evidence for this kind of nonlinear feedback mechanism in the empirical dynamics of the pandemic in France. However, rather than generating catastrophic secondary outbreaks (as is typically assumed), the model predicts that the impact of lockdown-induced variations in population susceptibility and transmission may eventually reduce to a steady-state endemic equilibrium with a low but stable infection rate. In brief, except if immunity is lost (because of, e.g., virus mutations), a secondary COVID wave before winter is unlikely.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Daunizeau","author_inst":"INSERM, France"},{"author_name":"Rosalyn Moran","author_inst":"King's College, UK"},{"author_name":"Jules Brochard","author_inst":"Paris Brain Institute, France"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Mattout","author_inst":"INSERM, France"},{"author_name":"Richard Frackowiak","author_inst":"EPFL, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Karl Friston","author_inst":"UCL, UK"},{"author_name":"Dominik Macak","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Stephan Riesenberg","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Lukas Bokelmann","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Hugo Zeberg","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Matthias Meyer","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Stephan Borte","author_inst":"Hospital St. Georg"},{"author_name":"Svante Paabo","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20139865","rel_title":"A Logistic Curve in the SIR Model and Its Application to Deaths by COVID-19 in Japan","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20139865","rel_abs":"Approximate solutions of SIR equations are given, based on a logistic growth curve in the Biology.

The goal of this study was to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the non-institutionalized disabled population in the United States using data from the most affected states as of April 9th, 2020. Methods: This was an ecological study of county-level factors associated with the infection and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the non-institutionalized disabled population. We analyzed data from 369 counties from the most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts) in the United States using data available by April 9th, 2020. The variables include changes in mobility reported by Google, race\/ethnicity, median income, education level, health insurance, and disability information from the United States Census Bureau. Bivariate regression analysis adjusted for state and median income was used to analyze the association between death rate and infection rate. Results: The independent sample t-test of two groups (group 1: Death rate[&ge;] 3.4% [median] and group 2: Death rate < 3.4%) indicates that counties with a higher total population, a lower percentage of Black males and females, higher median income, higher education, and lower percentage of disabled population have a lower rate (< 3.4%) of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality (all p-values<4.3E-02). The results of the bivariate regression when controlled for median income and state show counties with a higher White disabled population (est: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.01-0.37; p-value:3.7E-02), and higher population with independent living difficulty (est: 0.15, 95% CI: -0.01-0.30; p-value: 6.0E-02) have a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 related mortality. Also, the regression analysis indicates that counties with higher White disabled population (est: -0.22, 95% CI: -0.43-(-0.02); p-value: 3.3E-02), higher population with hearing disability (est: -0.26, 95% CI: -0.42- (-0.11); p-value:1.2E-03), and higher population with disability in the 18-34 years age group (est: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.41-(-0.09); p-value:2.4E-03) show a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We employed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks under five reopening strategies based on the business resumption progress in China. The effect of each strategy was evaluated using the peak values of the epidemic curves with respect to confirmed active cases and cumulative cases. We found that a hierarchy-based reopen strategy performed best when current epidemic prevention measures were maintained save for lockdown, reducing the peak number of active cases and cumulative cases by 50% and 44%, respectively. However, the modeled effect of each strategy decreased when the current intervention was lifted somewhat. Additional attention should be given to regions with significant numbers of migrants, as the potential risk of COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening is intrinsically high.

Conclusions In this study, we found that ESR is related to Hemoglobin and C-reactive protein.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Youshu Yuan","author_inst":"Guizhou University"},{"author_name":"Shucheng Zhang","author_inst":"Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Can Jin","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Mei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chen Miao","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhixia Jiang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhixu He","author_inst":"Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hugo Zeberg","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Matthias Meyer","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Stephan Borte","author_inst":"Hospital St. Georg"},{"author_name":"Svante Paabo","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139329","rel_title":"A Decision Analytic Approach for Social Distancing Policies During the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139329","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has become a crucial public health issue in many countries including the United States. In the absence of the right vaccine strain and sufficient antiviral stockpiles on hand, nonpharmaceutical interventions have become valuable public health tools at the early stages of the pandemic and they are employed by many countries across the globe. These interventions are designed to increase social distancing between individuals to reduce the transmission of the virus and eventually dampen the burden on the healthcare system. The virus transmissibility is a function of the average number of contacts individuals have in their communities and it is highly dependent on population density and daily mobility patterns, along with other social factors. These show significant variation across the United States. In this article, we study the effectiveness of social distancing measures in communities with different population density. Specifically, first we show how the empirical estimation of reproduction number differs for two completely different states, thus the experience of the COVID-19 outbreak is drastically different, suggesting different outbreak growth rates in practice. Second, we develop an age-structured compartmental model for simulating the disease spread to demonstrate the variation in the observed outbreak characteristics. We find that early trigger and late trigger options present a trade-off between the peak magnitude and the overall death toll of the outbreak which may also vary across different populations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeynep Ertem","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Araz","author_inst":"University of Nebraska"},{"author_name":"Maytee Cruz-Aponte","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Can Jin","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Wu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Mei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chen Miao","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhixia Jiang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhixu He","author_inst":"Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hugo Zeberg","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Matthias Meyer","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"},{"author_name":"Stephan Borte","author_inst":"Hospital St. Georg"},{"author_name":"Svante Paabo","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20140384","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Six Sites in the United States, March 23-May 3, 2020","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20140384","rel_abs":"Importance: Reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection likely underestimate the prevalence of infection in affected communities. Large-scale seroprevalence studies provide better estimates of the proportion of the population previously infected. Objective: To estimate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in convenience samples from several geographic sites in the United States. Design: Serologic testing of convenience samples using residual sera obtained for routine clinical testing by two commercial laboratory companies. Setting: Connecticut (CT), south Florida (FL), Missouri (MO), New York City metro region (NYC), Utah (UT), and Washington State's (WA) Puget Sound region. Participants: Persons of all ages with serum collected during intervals from March 23 through May 3, 2020. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Main outcomes and measures: We estimated the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an ELISA assay. We standardized estimates to the site populations by age and sex. Estimates were adjusted for test performance characteristics (96.0% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity). We estimated the number of infections in each site by extrapolating seroprevalence to site populations. We compared estimated infections to number of reported COVID-19 cases as of last specimen collection date. Results: We tested sera from 11,933 persons. Adjusted estimates of the proportion of persons seroreactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ranged from 1.13% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.94) in WA to 6.93% (95% CI 5.02-8.92) in NYC (collected March 23-April 1). For sites with later collection dates, estimates ranged from 1.85% (95% CI 1.00-3.23, collected April 6-10) for FL to 4.94% (95% CI 3.61-6.52) for CT (April 26-May 3). The estimated number of infections ranged from 6 to 24 times the number of reported cases in each site. Conclusions and relevance: Our seroprevalence estimates suggest that for five of six U.S. sites, from late March to early May 2020, >10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred than the number of reported cases. Seroprevalence and under-ascertainment varied by site and specimen collection period. Most specimens from each site had no evidence of antibody to SARS-CoV-2. Tracking population seroprevalence serially, in a variety of specific geographic sites, will inform models of transmission dynamics and guide future community-wide public health measures.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fiona P.

COVID-19 has been found adherent to PM2.5 and may be involved in the transmission and the exacerbation of COVID-19 infection, possibly due to PM2.5 adverse influence on respiratory immunity. The PM2.5 levels in underground subways have been found up to 90 times higher than the surface levels. Moreover, the commuter congestion in the presence of such high levels of PM2.5 further encouraged COVID-19 human to human transmission. METHOD: The levels of PM2.5 were retrieved from literature assessing particulate matter PM2.5 measured on subway platforms in two groups of cities. These cities were differentiated by the COVID-19 population percentage mortality rate (0.007% vs 0.09% (p<0.0004) the city population, more than a 10-fold difference. Data regarding the number of stations, length of the networks (km) and the annual ridership were also obtained from literature related to underground commuting. RESULTS: The population percentage mortality related to COVID-19 infection correlated significantly for both minimum (p<0.01) and maximum (p<0.00001) levels of PM2.5. The city subways with low COVID-19 mortality had minimum platform PM2.5 levels of 27.4 (SD+\/-17.2g\/m3) compared to 63.4g\/m3 (SD+\/-10.8g\/m3) in cities with high COVID-19 associated mortality (p<0.01). Subway maximum levels of PM2.5 in cities with low COVID-19 mortality was 53.4g\/m3 (SD+\/-21.8g\/m3) while that of underground networks with high COVID-19 mortality had maximum platform PM2.5 levels of 172.1g\/m3 (SD+\/-98g\/m3) (p<0.001). The cities with higher COVID-19 mortality had longer networks 230km (SD+\/-111km) versus 119km (SD+\/-99km) ( p<0.03) and more stations 191 (SD+\/-109) versus 102 (SD+\/-94) (p<0.047). Although the annual ridership in the cities with the high COVID-19 mortality was higher (1034x106 vs 751x106) this did not achieve statistical significance. The maximum PM2.5 correlated with the number of stations (p<0.045) and the length of the networks (p< 0.044). The minimum PM2.5 did not achieve similar significant correlations to subway variables. Ridership significantly correlated with number of stations (p<0.01) and the length of the network (p<0.02). CONCLUSION: Underground networks may have inherent characteristics accelerating spread of COVID-19 infection and consequent mortality. The highly elevated levels of PM2.5 in overcrowded subways with extensive reach may have acted as a co-factor to disseminate the pandemic.

Understanding the trend of COVID-19 is crucial to establishing the appropriate precautionary measures to mitigate the epidemic spread. The aim of this paper was to modifying and enhancing the mathematical modeling to guide health authority and assist in an early assessment of the epidemic outbreak and can be utilised to monitor non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Both ARIMA model and Logistic growth model were developed to study the trend and to provide short and long-term forecasting of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and dynamics. The data analyzed in this study covered the period between 2nd March and 21st June 2020. Two different scenarios were developed to predict the epidemic fluctuating trends and dynamics. The first scenario covered the period between 2nd March and 28th May when the first peak was observed and immediately declined. The analysis projected that the COVID-19 epidemic to reach a peak by 17th May with a total number of 58,534 infected cases and to end on the 4th August, if lockdown were not interrupted and folks followed the recommended personal and social safety guidelines. The second scenario was simulated because of the sudden sharp spike witnessed in the trend of the new confirmed cases on the last week of May and continue to escalate till the time of current writing-21st June. In the 2nd scenario, the analysis estimated the epidemic to peak on 15th June with a total number of 146,004 infected cases and to end on 29th September, 2020 with a final size of 209,607 (185,757 to 244,310) infected cases, assuming that the NPIs will be maintained while new normal life is resumed carefully. ARIMA and Logistic growth models showed excellent performance in projecting the epidemic prevalence, trends and dynamics at different phases. In conclusion, the analysis presented in this paper will assist policy-makers and health care authorities to evaluate the effect of the NPIs applied and to size the resources needed to manage different phases and cope with the final size of the epidemic estimates and to impose extra precautions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tusneem Elhassan","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Ameera Gaafar","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center"},{"author_name":"Travis W.

The virus responsible, SARS-CoV-2, has been found to possess a very close association with Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. The nucleocapsid protein can serve as a decent model for determining phylogenetic, evolutionary, and structural relationships between coronaviruses. Therefore, this study uses the nucleocapsid gene and protein to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the nucleocapsid gene and protein in SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related to those found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Evidence of recombination was detected within the N gene, along with the presence of a double amino acid insertion found in the N-terminal region. Homology modeling for the N-Terminal Domain revealed similar structures but distinct electrostatic surfaces and topological variations in the {beta}-hairpin that likely reflect specific adaptive functions. In respect to SARS-CoV-2, two amino acids (S37 and A267) were found to exist only in its N protein, along with an extended {beta}-hairpin that bends towards the nucleotide binding site. Collectively, this study strengthens the relationship among SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789, providing additional insights into the structure and adaptive nature of the nucleocapsid protein found in these coronaviruses. Furthermore, these data will enhance our understanding of the complete history behind SARS-CoV-2 and help assist in antiviral and vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noah Avery Schuster","author_inst":"DePauw University"},{"author_name":"Ameera Gaafar","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center"},{"author_name":"Travis W.

Yet, there is no consensus whether the virus can infect the brain, or what the consequences of CNS infection are. Here, we used three independent approaches to probe the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brain. First, using human brain organoids, we observed clear evidence of infection with accompanying metabolic changes in the infected and neighboring neurons. However, no evidence for the type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented either by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Second, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate in vivo that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, but not respiratory infection, is associated with mortality. Finally, in brain autopsy from patients who died of COVID-19, we detect SARS-CoV-2 in the cortical neurons, and note pathologic features associated with infection with minimal immune cell infiltrates. These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV2, and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Song","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Ce Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Alice Lu-Culligan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Alba Sprado","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Sophie Skriabine","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Orr-El Weizman","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Yile Dai","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Yuki Yasumoto","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Guilin Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Castaldi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jaime Heltke","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Ng","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"John Wheeler","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Mia Madel Alfajaro","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Etienne LEVAVASSEUR","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fontes","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Neal Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shrikant Mane","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Murat Gunel","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Aaron Ring","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Syed Kazmi","author_inst":"Geisinger Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhang","author_inst":"Geisinger Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamas Horvath","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Plu","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"stephane Haik","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"jean-leon thomas","author_inst":"Yale school of medicine"},{"author_name":"Angeliki LOUVI","author_inst":"YAle School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anita Huttner","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"danielle seilhean","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Nicolas RENIER","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Kaya Bilguvar","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.173476","rel_title":"In situ structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals flexibility mediated by three hinges","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.173476","rel_abs":"The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is required for cell entry and is the major focus for vaccine development.

We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges that give the globular domain unexpected orientational freedom. We propose that the hinges allow S to scan the host cell surface, shielded from antibodies by an extensive glycan coat. The structure of native S contributes to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of safe vaccines.

Because human ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing the human ACE2 gene have shown promise as a potential model for COVID-19. Five mice from the transgenic mouse strain K18-hACE2 were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 Hong Kong\/VM20001061\/2020. Mice were followed twice daily for five days and scored for weight loss and clinical symptoms. Infected mice did not exhibit any signs of infection until day four, when weight loss, but no other obvious clinical symptoms were observed. By day five all infected mice had lost around 10% of their original body weight, but exhibited variable clinical symptoms. All infected mice showed high viral titers in the lungs as well as altered lung histology associated with proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space, interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar septal thickening. Overall, these results show that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can be established in the K18-hACE2 transgenic background and should be a useful mouse model for COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"G.

We recently illustrated that leukemia patients are identified by machine learning (ML) based on their blood transcriptomes. However, there is an increasing divide between what is technically possible and what is allowed because of privacy legislation. To facilitate integration of any omics data from any data owner world-wide without violating privacy laws, we here introduce Swarm Learning (SL), a decentralized machine learning approach uniting edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination as well as privacy protection without the need for a central coordinator thereby going beyond federated learning. Using more than 14,000 blood transcriptomes derived from over 100 individual studies with non-uniform distribution of cases and controls and significant study biases, we illustrate the feasibility of SL to develop disease classifiers based on distributed data for COVID-19, tuberculosis or leukemias that outperform those developed at individual sites. Still, SL completely protects local privacy regulations by design. We propose this approach to noticeably accelerate the introduction of precision medicine.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefanie Warnat-Herresthal","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hartmut Schultze","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Krishna Prasad Lingadahalli Shastry","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Sathyanarayanan Manamohan","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mukherjee","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Vishesh Garg","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Ravi Sarveswara","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Kristian Haendler","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Peter Pickkers","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine and Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases (RCI), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, 6500HB, The Netherland"},{"author_name":"N Ahmad Aziz","author_inst":"\"Population Health Sciences, German Center for Neurodegenerative diseases (DZNE), Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany; Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Unive"},{"author_name":"Sofia Ktena","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, 124 62 Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Christian Siever","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Michael Kraut","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Milind Desai","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Bruno Monet","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Maria Saridaki","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, 124 62 Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Charles Martin Siegel","author_inst":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},{"author_name":"Anna Drews","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Melanie Nuesch-Germano","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heidi Theis","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Mihai G Netea","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases (RCI), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500HB, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Fabian J Theis","author_inst":"Helmholtz Center Munich"},{"author_name":"Anna C Aschenbrenner","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany and Radboud UMC, Nijmegen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ulas","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany, PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative "},{"author_name":"Monique M.B.

We demonstrate that the method concentrates virus prior to RNA extraction, thus significantly improving detection of the virus using a real-time RT-PCR assay across a range of viral titers, from 100 to 1,000,000 viral copies\/mL; in particular, detection of virus in low viral load samples is enhanced when using the method coupled with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit. This method is compatible with commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits, as well with a simple heat and detergent method. Using transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 using either the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=14) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=35), we demonstrate that our method not only correctly identifies all positive samples (n = 17) but also significantly improves detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold (Ct) value as measured with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit was 3.1; n = 10. Finally, to demonstrate that the method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, we spiked infectious virus or a confirmed positive diagnostic remnant sample into 5 mL and 10 mL of negative transport medium and observed significant improvement in the detection of the virus from those larger sample volumes.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert A Barclay","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Ivan Akhrymuk","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Anurag Patnaik","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Victoria Callahan","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Caitlin Lehman","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Andersen","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Robbie Barbero","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Stephanie Barksdale","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Ross Dunlap","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Goldfarb","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Tara Jones-Roe","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Ross Kelly","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Brianna Kim","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Shida Miao","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Amy Munns","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Denton Munns","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Samip Patel","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Erica Porter","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Rosalind Ramsey","author_inst":"CeresNanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Saswata Sahoo","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Olivia Swahn","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Jack Warsh","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Ben Lepene","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Monique M.B.

It degrades the polyuridine extensions in (-) sense strand of viral RNA and some non-translated RNA on (+) sense strand. This activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response and evasion of host pattern recognition. Nsp15 is highly conserved in coronaviruses suggesting that its activity is important for virus replication. Here we report first structures with bound nucleotides and show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 specifically recognizes U in a pattern previously predicted for EndoU. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. Inhibitors of Nsp15 have been reported but not actively pursued into therapeutics. The current COVID-19 pandemic brought to attention the repurposing of existing drugs and the rapid identification of new antiviral compounds. Tipiracil is an FDA approved drug that is used with trifluridine in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Here, we combine crystallography, biochemical and whole cell assays, and show that this compound inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 and interacts with the uridine binding pocket of the enzyme\u2019s active site, providing basis for the uracil scaffold-based drug development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youngchang Kim","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jacek Wower","author_inst":"Auburn University"},{"author_name":"Natalia Maltseva","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Changsoo Chang","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mateusz Wilamowski","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Soowon Kang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vlad Nicolaescu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Karolina Michalska","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Joachimiak","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Ross Kelly","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Brianna Kim","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Shida Miao","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Amy Munns","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Denton Munns","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Samip Patel","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Erica Porter","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Rosalind Ramsey","author_inst":"CeresNanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Saswata Sahoo","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Olivia Swahn","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Jack Warsh","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Ben Lepene","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Monique M.B.

We combined this information with bioinformatic analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamics simulations of each glycoprotein alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions. Furthermore, our results illustrate the impact of viral evolution and divergence on Spike glycosylation, as well as the influence of natural variants on ACE2 receptor glycosylation that, taken together, can facilitate immunogen design to achieve antibody neutralization and inform therapeutic strategies to inhibit viral infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Zhao","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Jeremy L Praissman","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Oliver C Grant","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Yongfei Cai","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Xiao","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Katelyn E Rosenbalm","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Kazuhiro Aoki","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Samip Patel","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Erica Porter","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Rosalind Ramsey","author_inst":"CeresNanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Saswata Sahoo","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Olivia Swahn","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Jack Warsh","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Ben Lepene","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Monique M.B.

The first autochthonous Italian case of COVID-19 was documented on February 21. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Italy earlier than that date, by analysing 40 composite influent wastewater samples collected - in the framework of other wastewater-based epidemiology projects - between October 2019 and February 2020 from five wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) in three cities and regions in northern Italy (Milan\/Lombardy, Turin\/Piedmont and Bologna\/Emilia Romagna). Twenty-four additional samples collected in the same WTPs between September 2018 and June 2019 were included as blank samples. Viral concentration was performed according to the standard World Health Organization procedure for poliovirus sewage surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with both nested RT-PCR and real-rime RT-PCR assays. A total of 15 positive samples were confirmed by both methods. Of these, 8 were collected before the first autochthonous Italian case. The earliest dates back to 18 December 2019 in Milan and Turin and 29 January 2020 in Bologna. Samples collected in January and February in the three cities were also positive. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in northern Italy at the end of 2019. Moreover, it was circulating in different geographic regions simultaneously, which changes our previous understanding of the geographical circulation of the virus in Italy. Our study highlights once again the importance of environmental surveillance as an early warning system, to monitor the levels of virus circulating in the population and identify outbreaks even before cases are notified to the healthcare system.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppina La Rosa","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Pamela Mancini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Giusy Bonanno Ferraro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Carolina Veneri","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di sanita'"},{"author_name":"Marcello Iaconelli","author_inst":"Istituto Supere di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bonadonna","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Samip Patel","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Erica Porter","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Rosalind Ramsey","author_inst":"CeresNanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Saswata Sahoo","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Olivia Swahn","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Jack Warsh","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Ben Lepene","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Monique M.B.

Therefore we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. Methods: COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, n=204), inpatients (cohort B, n=81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohort C, n=23). Results: Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6micromol\/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. Conclusion: We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theresa Hippchen","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine IV, University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Sandro Altamura","author_inst":"Pediatric Oncology, Hematology & Immunology, University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Martina U.

In the model, nodes correspond to locations or communities that are connected by links indicating travel and commuting between different locations. While this proposed modelling framework can be applied on all levels of spatial granularity and different countries, we consider Ireland as a case study. The network comprises 3440 electoral divisions (EDs) of the Republic of Ireland and 890 superoutput areas (SOAs) for Northern Ireland, which corresponds to local administrative units below the NUTS 3 regions. The local dynamics within each node follows a phenomenological SIRX compartmental model including classes of Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered and Quarantined (X) inspired from Science 368, 742 (2020). For better comparison to empirical data, we extended that model by a class of Deaths. We consider various scenarios including the 5-phase roadmap for Ireland. In addition, as proof of concept, we investigate the effect of dynamic interventions that aim to keep the number of infected below a given threshold. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting containment measures on a national scale, which could also be implemented at a regional (county) or local (ED\/SOA) level. We find that - in principle - dynamic interventions are capable to limit the impact of future waves of outbreaks, but on the downside, such a strategy can last several years until herd immunity will be reached.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rory Humphries","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Mary Spillane","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Kieran Mulchrone","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Wieczorek","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Micheal O'Riordain","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Mercy University Hospital, Cork"},{"author_name":"Philipp Hoevel","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Samip Patel","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Erica Porter","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Rosalind Ramsey","author_inst":"CeresNanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Saswata Sahoo","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Olivia Swahn","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Jack Warsh","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Ben Lepene","author_inst":"Ceres Nanosciences Inc."},{"author_name":"Monique M.B.

This research paper analyses COVID19 data initially at a global level and then drills down to the scenario obtained in India. Data is gathered from multiple data sources- several authentic government websites. The need of the hour is to accurately forecast when the numbers will reach at its peak and then diminish. It will be of huge help to public welfare professionals to plan the preventive measures to be taken keeping the economic balance of the country as well. Variables such as gender, geographical location, age etc. have been represented using Python and Data Visualization techniques. Time Series Forecasting techniques including Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Polynomial Regression and Deep Learning Forecasting Model like LSTM(Long short-term memory) are deployed to study the probable hike in cases and in the near future. A comparative analysis is also done to understand which model fits the best for our data. Data is considered till 30th July, 2020. The results show that a statistical model named sigmoid model is outperforming other models. Also the Sigmoid model is giving an estimate of the day on which we can expect the number of active cases to reach its peak and also when the curve will start to flatten. Strength of Sigmoid model lies in providing a count of date that no other model offers and thus it is the best model to predict Covid cases counts: this is unique feature of analysis in this paper. Certain feature engineering techniques have been used to transfer data into logarithmic scale as is affords better comparison removing any data extremities or outliers.

A significant set of patients with extra pulmonary symptoms has been reported worldwide. Neurological involvement in the form of altered mental status, loss of consciousness in considerable amounts has drawn attention of physicians all across the globe. Here we venture out to summarise the clinical profile, investigations and radiological findings among patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated meningoencephalitis in the form of a systematic review, which may aid clinicians in early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of the disease. Methodology: This review was carried out based on the existing PRISMA (Preferred Report for Systemic Review and Meta analyses) consensus statement. The data for this review was collected from four databases: Pubmed\/Medline, NIH Litcovid, Embase and Cochrane library and Preprint servers up till 10th June, 2020. Search strategy comprised of a range of keywords from relevant medical subject headings which includes \"SARS-COV-2\", \"COVID-19\", \"meningoencephalitis\" etc. All peer reviewed, case control, case report, pre print articles satisfying our inclusion criteria were involved in the study. The inclusion prerequisites comprised of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases with neurological manifestations, previous cases of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV with neurological involvement provided all the studies were published in English language. Quantitative data was expressed in mean+\/-SD, while the qualitative date in percentages. Paired t test was used for analysing the data based on differences between mean and respective values with a p value of <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 43 cases were involved from 24 studies after screening from databases and preprint servers, out of which 29 of them had completed investigation profile and were included in the final analysis. Clincial and Laboratory findings as well as neuroimaging findings (CT, MRI and MRS) revealed consistent presentations towards association of COVID-19 with meningoencephalitis. Epileptogenic pictures were also evident on EEG (electroencephalogram) findings. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from CSF as well as cerebrum of cases with meningoencephalitis depicting the natural tendency of the virus to invade the central nervous system. Speculations about retrograde olfactory transport or alternative haematogenous spread seem to be correlating with above findings. This review may raise the index of suspicion about COVID-19 among clinicians while attending patients with neurological manifestations.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ritwick Mondal","author_inst":"Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Upasana Ganguly","author_inst":"Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Shramana Deb","author_inst":"S.N.

A recent study by Chu et al. has indicated that the anticipated probability of viral infection is about 12.8% within 1 m and about 2.6% at further distance through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This important information provides us a unique opportunity to assess the dose-response relation of the viruses, if reasonable exposure dose could be estimated. Here we developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV based on mice experiments, and the recent data on infection risk and viral shedding, to shed light on the dose-response relation for human. The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of 6.19E4 to 7.28E5 virus copies. The result mean that the infection risk caused by one virus copy in viral shedding is about 1.5E-6 to 1.6E-5. The developed dose-response relation provides a tool to quantify the magnitude of the infection risk.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaole Zhang","author_inst":"1.
