Sampling was carried out on 8 and 27 May 2020 from Old Pirana Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) at Ahmedabad, Gujarat with 106 million liters per day (MLD) capacity receiving effluent of Civil Hospital treating COVID-19 patient. All three i.e. ORF1ab, N and S genes of SARS-CoV-2 were discerned in the influents with no gene spotted in the effluent collected on 8 and 27 May 2020. Temporal difference between 8 and 27 May 2020 samples was of 10x in gene copy loading with a corresponding change of 2x in the number active COVID-19 patient in the city. Number of gene copies was found comparable to that reported in the untreated wastewaters of Australia, China, and Turkey and lower than that of the USA, France, and Spain. This study, being the first from India and probably among the first ten reports in the world of gene detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the environmental samples, aims to assist concerned authorities and policymakers to formulate and\/or upgrade the COVID-19 surveillance to have an explicit picture of the phase of the pandemic. While infectious SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified in the aquatic environment, the virus potentially enters the wastewater stream from patient excretions and thus can be a great tool for pandemic monitoring.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manish Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, India"},{"author_name":"Arbind K Patel","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Anil V Shah","author_inst":"Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Gandhinagar, India"},{"author_name":"Janvi Raval","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Neha Rajpara","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Madhvi Joshi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya G Joshi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre, Gujarat"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20133116","rel_title":"Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in two longitudinal UK population cohorts","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20133116","rel_abs":"Background: The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is unclear. Evidence from longitudinal studies with pre pandemic data are needed to address (1) how mental health has changed from pre-pandemic levels to during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2), whether there are groups at greater risk of poorer mental health during the pandemic? Methods: We used data from COVID-19 surveys (completed through April\/May 2020), nested within two large longitudinal population cohorts with harmonised measures of mental health: two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALPSAC): the index generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2850, mean age 28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n= 3720, mean age = 59) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS, (n= 4233, mean age = 59), both with validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and baseline factors. To answer question 1, we used ALSPAC-G1, which has identical mental health measures before and during the pandemic. Question 2 was addressed using both studies, using pre-pandemic and COVID-19 specific factors to explore associations with depression and anxiety in COVID-19. Findings: In ALSPAC-G1 there was evidence that anxiety and lower wellbeing, but not depression, had increased in COVID-19 from pre-pandemic assessments. The percentage of individuals with probable anxiety disorder was almost double during COVID-19: 24% (95% CI 23%, 26%) compared to pre-pandemic levels (13%, 95% CI 12%, 14%), with clinically relevant effect sizes. In both ALSPAC and GS, depression and anxiety were greater in younger populations, women, those with pre-existing mental and physical health conditions, those living alone and in socio-economic adversity. We did not detect evidence for elevated risk in key workers or health care workers. Interpretation: These results suggest increases in anxiety and lower wellbeing that may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and\/or its management, particularly in young people. This research highlights that specific groups may be disproportionally at risk of elevated levels of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 and supports recent calls for increasing funds for mental health services.

Wealthier countries had the greatest caseload. Obesity was the primary modifiable risk factor for infection and greater age, male sex, physical inactivity and low salt consumption were associated with excess deaths. Obesity was less influential on mortality than physical inactivity. Globally, obesity confers vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and physical inactivity likely explains the greater mortality in the obese. High salt consumption may induce reductions in tissue ACE2 expression and subsequently reduce mortality rates.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Joseph Burden","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Josefien Rademaker","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin David Weedon","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Luke Whaymand","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Helen Dawes","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Jones","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chloe Fawns-Ritchie","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Helen Bould","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Naomi Warne","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Stan Zammit","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"David J Gunnell","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Paul Moran","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Nadia Micali","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Abraham Reichenberg","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Rai","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Simon Haworth","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Flaig","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McIntosh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"David Porteous","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Timpson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132787","rel_title":"State-wise estimates of current hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators in India: Are we prepared for a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations?","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132787","rel_abs":"Background The rapid spread of COVID-19 globally has prompted policymakers to evaluate the capacity of health care infrastructure in their communities. Many hard-hit localities have witnessed a large influx of severe cases that strained existing hospitals. As COVID-19 spreads in India, it is essential to evaluate the country's capacity to treat severe cases. Methods We combined data on public and private sector hospitals in India to produce state level estimates of hospital beds, ICU beds, and mechanical ventilators. Based on the number of public sector hospitals from the 2019 National Health Profile (NHP) of India and the relative proportions of public and private health care facilities from the National Sample Survey (NSS) 75th round (2017-2018), we estimated capacity in each Indian state and union territory (UT). We assumed that 5% of all hospital beds were ICU beds and that 50% of ICU beds were equipped with ventilators. Results We estimated that India has approximately 1.9 million hospital beds, 95,000 ICU beds and 48,000 ventilators. Nationally, resources are concentrated in the private sector (hospital beds: 1,185,242 private vs 713,986 public; ICU beds: 59,262 private vs 35,699 public; ventilators: 29,631 private vs. 17,850 public). Our findings suggest substantial variation in available resources across states and UTs. Conclusion Some projections shave suggested a potential need for approximately 270,000 ICU beds in an optimistic scenario, over 2.8 times the estimated number of total available ICU beds in India. Additional resources will likely be required to accommodate patients with severe COVID-19 infections in India.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Geetanjali Kapoor","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Hauck","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Aditi Sriram","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Jyoti Joshi","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Emily Schueller","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ruchita Balasubramanian","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ramanan Laxminarayan","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Arindam Nandi","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Stan Zammit","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"David J Gunnell","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Paul Moran","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Nadia Micali","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Abraham Reichenberg","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Rai","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Simon Haworth","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Flaig","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McIntosh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"David Porteous","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Timpson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132878","rel_title":"The Cardiac Toxicity of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-regression Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132878","rel_abs":"Abstract Importance The antimalarial agents chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due their effect on several cellular processes that impact viral replication. Although more than 100 ongoing trials are testing their efficacy, CQ and HCQ are being used widely in clinical practice, exposing COVID-19 patients to potentially significant cardiac adverse effects. Objective To systematically review the literature and estimate the risk of cardiac toxicity in patients receiving CQ or HCQ for COVID-19. Data Sources A systematic search was conducted on May 27, 2020 of Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase (1974+), Ovid Medline (1946+ including epub ahead of print, in-process & other non-indexed citations), Scopus (1970+) and Web of Science (1975+) and preprint servers (Medrvix and ResearchSquare) and manual search of references lists. Study Selection Studies that included COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without azithromycin, were included as follows: (1) COVID-19 patient population, (2) the study included more than 10 patients receiving either one of the medications, (3) reported electrocardiographic changes and\/or cardiac arrhythmias. Data Extraction and Synthesis Study characteristics and endpoints incidence were extracted. Due to the very low incidence of torsades de pointes (TdP) and other endpoints (rare events), the arcsine transformation was used to obtain a pooled estimate of the different incidences using a random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses were used to assess whether the incidence of different endpoints significantly varied by multiple study-level variables specified a priori. Main Outcomes and Measures Pooled Incidence of: (1) change in QTc value from baseline [&ge;] 60 ms, (2) QTc [&ge;] 500 ms, (3) the composite of endpoint 1 and 2, (4) TdP arrhythmia or ventricular tachycardia (VT) or cardiac arrest, (5) discontinuation of treatment due to drug-induced QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Results A total of 19 studies with a total of 5652 patients were included. All included studies were of high methodological quality in terms of exposure ascertainment or outcome assessment. Among 2719 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, only two episodes of TdP were reported; the pooled incidence of TdP arrhythmia or VT or cardiac arrest was 3 per 1000, 95% CI (0-21), I2=96%, 18 studies with 3725 patients. Among 13 studies of 4334 patients, the pooled incidence of discontinuation of CQ or HCQ due to prolonged QTc or arrhythmias was 5%, 95% CI (1-11), I2=98%. The pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [&ge;] 60 ms was 7%, 95% CI (3-14), I2=94% (12 studies of 2008 patients). The pooled incidence of QTc [&ge;] 500 ms was 6%, 95% CI (2-12), I2=95% (16 studies of 2317 patients). Among 11 studies of 3127 patients, the pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [&ge;] 60 ms or QTc [&ge;] 500 ms was 9%, 95% CI (3-17), I2=97%. Mean\/median age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, concomitant QT prolonging medications, ICU care, and severity of illness in the study populations explained between-studies heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance Treatment of COVID-19 patients with CQ or HCQ is associated with a significant risk of drug-induced QT prolongation, which is a harbinger for drug-induced TdP\/VT or cardiac arrest. CQ\/HCQ use resulted in a relatively higher incidence of TdP as compared to drugs withdrawn from the market for this particular adverse effect. Therefore, these agents should be used only in the context of randomized clinical trials, in patients at low risk for drug-induced QT prolongation, with adequate safety monitoring.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Imad Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahd Medical City"},{"author_name":"Zakariya Kashour","author_inst":"University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Ca"},{"author_name":"Oweida AlDosary","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Riaz","author_inst":"Quaid Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Haytham Tlayjeh","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud bin Abdulaziz for Health Sciences and King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Musa A Garbati","author_inst":"University of Maiduguri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Rana Tleyjeh","author_inst":"Al Faisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Mouaz H Al-Mallah","author_inst":"Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center, Houston, TX , USA"},{"author_name":"Rizwan M Sohail","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Dana Gerberi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Aref A Bin Abdulhak","author_inst":"Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA"},{"author_name":"John R Giudicessi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael John Ackerman","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University Medical City  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Rai","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Simon Haworth","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Flaig","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McIntosh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"David Porteous","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Timpson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133348","rel_title":"Perceived Challenges of COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control Preparedness: A Multinational Survey","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133348","rel_abs":"Objectives Implementation of effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures is needed to support global capacity building to limit transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mitigate its impact on health systems.

Methods A cross-sectional survey using an electronic survey was circulated between February 26, 2020, and March 20, 2020, to IPC professionals during COVID-19 pandemic. The survey addressed the presence of COVID-19 guidelines as well as specific IPC preparedness activities in response to the outbreak. Findings In total, 339 IPC professionals spanning 63 countries in all 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions, mostly from tertiary care centres participated. Of all participants, 66{middle dot}6% were aware of the existence of national guidelines to prevent COVID-19. A shortage of PPE supplies was reported by 48% (ranging from 64{middle dot}2% in low-income countries to 27{middle dot}4% in high-income countries); 41{middle dot}5% of respondents considered that the media had an impact on guideline development and 63{middle dot}6% believed that guidelines were based on maximum security rather than on evidence-based analyses. 58{middle dot}5% and 72{middle dot}7% of participants believed that healthcare facilities and community settings respectively were not sufficiently prepared. Conclusion Results revealed lack of guidelines and concerns over insufficient PPE supply in both high- and low-income countries. Our findings should alert national health authorities to ramp up the implementation of IPC measures and focus on long-term preparedness and readiness for future pandemics, likely requiring government funds rather than reliance on healthcare institutions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ERMIRA TARTARI","author_inst":"University of Malta"},{"author_name":"Joost Hopman","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Benedetta Allegranzi","author_inst":"World Health Organziation"},{"author_name":"Bin Gao","author_inst":"Tianjin 4th Centre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Vincent Chi-Chung Cheng","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shuk Ching Wong","author_inst":"Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kalisvar Marimuthu","author_inst":"Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Folasade Ogunsola","author_inst":"College of Medicine of the University of Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Andreas Voss","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Aref A Bin Abdulhak","author_inst":"Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA"},{"author_name":"John R Giudicessi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael John Ackerman","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University Medical City  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Rai","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Simon Haworth","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Flaig","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McIntosh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"David Porteous","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Timpson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133520","rel_title":"Effect of evacuation of Japanese residents from Wuhan, China, on preventing transmission of novel coronavirus infection: a modelling study","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133520","rel_abs":"Objective: In late January 2020, the Japanese government carried out three evacuations by aircraft from Wuhan, China, to avoid further cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Wuhan's Japanese residents.

Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect. Methods: We systemically developed an ELISA assay, optimising different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. Results: Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more anti-spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting. Conclusions. Detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Funding.

The diagnosis of infection is complicated by 30-50% of COVID-19 hospital admissions with nose\/throat swabs testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, frequently after the first week of illness when SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses become detectable. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combined rapid antibody point of care (POC) and nucleic acid assays for suspected COVID-19 disease in the emergency department. Methods We developed (i) an in vitro neutralization assay using a lentivirus expressing a genome encoding luciferase and pseudotyped with spike (S) protein and (ii) an ELISA test to detect IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) and S proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We tested two lateral flow rapid fingerprick tests with bands for IgG and IgM. We then prospectively recruited participants with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in a combined nasal\/throat swab using the standard laboratory RT-PCR and a validated rapid POC nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) test. Additionally, serum collected at admission was retrospectively tested by in vitro neutralisation, ELISA and the candidate POC antibody tests. We evaluated the performance of the individual and combined rapid POC diagnostic tests against a composite reference standard of neutralisation and standard laboratory based RT-PCR. Results 45 participants had specimens tested for nucleic acid in nose\/throat swabs as well as stored sera for antibodies. Using the composite reference standard, prevalence of COVID-19 disease was 53.3% (24\/45). Median age was 73.5 (IQR 54.0-86.5) years in those with COVID-19 disease by our reference standard and 63.0 (IQR 41.0-72.0) years in those without disease. The overall detection rate by rapid NAAT was 79.2% (95CI 57.8-92.9%), decreasing from 100% (95% CI 65.3-98.6%) in days 1-4 to 50.0% (95% CI 11.8-88.2) for days 9-28 post symptom onset. Correct identification of COVID-19 with combined rapid POC diagnostic tests was 100% (95CI 85.8-100%) with a false positive rate of 5.3-14.3%, driven by POC LFA antibody tests. Conclusions Combined POC tests have the potential to transform our management of COVID-19, including inflammatory manifestations later in disease where nucleic acid test results are negative. A rapid combined approach will also aid recruitment into clinical trials and in prescribing therapeutics, particularly where potentially harmful immune modulators (including steroids) are used.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Petra Mlcochova","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dami Collier","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Allyson V Ritchie","author_inst":"Diagnostics for the Real World Europe Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sonny M Assennato","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Myra Hosmillo","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Neha Goel","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bo Meng","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Krishna Chatterji","author_inst":"NIHR Cambridge Clinical Research Facility"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Leo Kiss","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna A Ciazyns","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Xiong","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"John AG Briggs","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"James Nathan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Federica Mescia","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hongyi Zhang","author_inst":"CUH NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Petros Barmpounakis","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Nikos Demeris","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Richard Skells","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Paul Lyons","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Bradley","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Jean Pierre Allain","author_inst":"Diagnostics for the Real World EU Ltd"},{"author_name":"Kenneth GC Smith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"ig299@cam.ac.uk"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex G.

Reasons for this disparity have not been well-characterized but may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors. Objective: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial\/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design: A retrospective cohort study with comparative control groups. Setting: Patients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Participants: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in\/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race\/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Results: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2%) and non-Hispanic Black\/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2% NHW and 37.4% NHAA; 44.8% hospitalized, 20.6% admitted to ICU, and 3.8% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization. Pre-existing kidney disease led to 2.55 times higher risk of hospitalization (95% CI, 1.62-4.02; P<.001) in the overall population and 11.9 times higher mortality risk in NHAA (95% CI, 2.2-64.7, P=.004). Conclusions and Relevance: Pre-existing type II diabetes\/kidney diseases and living in high population density areas were associated with high risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor prognosis. Association of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race. NHAA patients were disproportionately affected by obesity and kidney disease.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tian Gu","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jasmine A.

Methods: Between April 25th and May 23rd, we contacted 793 individuals aged 18 and older, who previously participated in studies conducted in the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Karonga District, Malawi. During an interview by mobile phone, we ascertained sources of information about COVID-19 and we evaluated knowledge of respondents about the transmission and course of SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19. We also asked them to evaluate their own risk of infection and severe illness. Finally, we inquired about the preventive measures they had adopted in response to the pandemic. We describe patterns of knowledge and behaviors among survey respondents, by area of residence (rural vs. urban). Results: We interviewed 630 respondents (79.5% response rate) which included 260 men and 370 women. Four hundred and eighty-nine respondents resided in rural areas (77.6%) and 141 resided in urban areas (22.4%). Only one respondent had never heard of COVID-19. Respondents reported on average 4 distinct sources of information about COVID-19. Misconceptions about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and about the course and severity of COVID-19, were common. For example, two thirds of respondents believed that everyone with COVID-19 would eventually become severely ill. Increased hand washing and avoiding crowds were the most reported strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Use of face masks was more common among urban residents (22.5%) than among rural residents (5.0%). Conclusion: Despite widespread access to information about the COVID-19 pandemic, gaps in knowledge about COVID-19 persist in this population. The adoption of preventive strategies remains limited, possibly due to limited perceived risk of infection among a large fraction of the population.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jethro Banda","author_inst":"Malawi Epidemiological and Intervention Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Albert Dube","author_inst":"Malawi Epidemiological and Intervention Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Sarah Brumfield","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Abena Amoah","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amelia Crampin","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Georges Reniers","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Helleringer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kheterpal","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lynda Lisabeth","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lars G.

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequential supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated, that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS, using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity but the second cohort (n=227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either. Virus stability in saliva was also investigated, with and without the addition of commercially available stabilizing solutions. The virus was stable in saliva at both 4C and room temperature for up to 7 days. The addition of stabilizing solutions did not enhance stability and in some situations reduced detectable virus levels.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara B Griesemer","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Greta Van Slyke","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Dylan Ehrbar","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Klemen Strle","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Tugba Yildirim","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Dominick A Centurioni","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Anne C Walsh","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew K Chang","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael J Waxman","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Bhramar G.

Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted from March 10, 2020 to April 21, 2020 in admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19. Patients were included if [&ge;] 18 years old and admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Data was collected via chart review from the enterprise electronic health record database. Data collected include factors driving antibiotic choice, indication, and duration of therapy as well as microbiological data. Findings: Antibiotics were initiated on admission in 87\/147 (59%) patients. Of these, 85\/87 (98%) prescriptions were empiric. The most common indication for empiric antibiotics was concern for community-acquired pneumonia (76\/85, 89%) with the most prescribed antibiotics being ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was two days (interquartile range 1-5). No patients had a community-acquired bacterial respiratory coinfection, but 10\/147 (7%) of patients were found to have concurrent bacterial infections from a non-respiratory source, and one patient was diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of admission for COVID-19. Interpretation: Bacterial coinfection in patients with COVID-19 was infrequent. Antibiotics are likely unnecessary in patients with mild symptoms. There is little role for broad-spectrum antibiotics to empirically treat multidrug resistant organisms in patients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. Antimicrobial stewardship remains important in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenjing Wei","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Jessica K Ortwine","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Norman S Mang","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Christopher Joseph","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brenton C Hall","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Chase Prokesch","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Anne C Walsh","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew K Chang","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael J Waxman","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Bhramar G.

Africa is the last and least affected to date. However, Algeria is among the first countries affected since February 25, 2020. In order to benefit from its experience in the least affected countries, this study aims to describe the current situation of the epidemic and then retrospectively estimate its real burden. As a first part of the study, we described the indicators of the epidemic as; the cumulative and daily reported cases and deaths, and we computed the R0 evolution. Secondly, we used the New York City cases-fatality rate standardized by Algerian age structure, to retrospectively estimate the actual burden. We found that reported cases are in a clear diminution, but, the epidemic epicentre is moving from Blida to other cities. We noted a clear peak in daily cases-fatality from March 30, to April 17, 2020, Fig. 3, due to underestimating the actual infections of the first 25 days. Since May 8, 2020, the daily R0 is around one, Fig. 4. Moreover, we noticed 31% reduction of its mean value from 1,41 to 0,97 between the last two months. The Algerian Age-Standardized Infection Fatality Rate we found is 0,88%. Based on that, we demonstrated that only 1,5% of actual infections were detected and reported before March 30, and 20% after March 31, Fig. 5. Therefore, the actual infections burden is currently five times higher than reported. At the end, we found that at least 0,2 % of the population have been infected until May 27. Consequently, the acquired herd immunity to date is therefore not sufficient to avoid a second wave. We believe that, the under estimation of the actual burden of the epidemic is probably due to the lack of testing capacities, however, all the indicators show that the situation is currently controlled. This requires more vigilance for the next weeks during the gradual easing of the preventive measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed HAMIDOUCHE Sr.","author_inst":"Pasteur Institute of Algeria\/ Public Health school of Pasteur-CNAM of Paris"},{"author_name":"Nassira BELMESSABIH Sr.","author_inst":"Pasteur Institute of Algeria"},{"author_name":"Norman S Mang","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Christopher Joseph","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brenton C Hall","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Chase Prokesch","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Anne C Walsh","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew K Chang","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael J Waxman","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Bhramar G.

From January 23 to March 31 in 2020, epidemiological and clinical information of confirmed patients are collected for analysis. Stool and pharyngeal swab samples are collected for RT-PCR testing. 64 confirmed patients are included and 17 patients present re-positive testing after discharge.

Based on mortality data up to early May, it concludes that only one of the interventions, lockdown, has been efficient in 10 out of 11 studied European countries. We show, via simulations using the ICCRT model code, that conclusions regarding the effectiveness of individual NPIs are not justified. Our analysis focuses on the 11th country, Sweden, an outlier in that no lockdown was effectuated. The new simulations show that estimated NPI efficiencies across all 11 countries change drastically unless the model is adapted to give the Swedish data special treatment. While stated otherwise in the Nature article, such adaptation has been done in the model code reproducing its results: An ungrounded country-specific parameter said to have been introduced in all 11 countries, is in the code only activated for Sweden. This parameter de facto provides a new NPI category, only present in Sweden, and with an impact comparable to that of a lockdown. While the considered NPIs have unarguably contributed to reduce virus spread, our analysis reveals that their individual efficiency cannot be reliably quantified by the ICCRT model, provided mortality data up to early May.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristian Soltesz","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Gustafsson","author_inst":"Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Toomas Timpka","author_inst":"Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Joakim Jald\u00e9n","author_inst":"KTH Royal institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Carl Jidling","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Albin Heimerson","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Sch\u00f6n","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Armin Spreco","author_inst":"Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Joakim Ekberg","author_inst":"Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland"},{"author_name":"\u00d6rjan Dahlstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Bagge Carlson","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Anna J\u00f6ud","author_inst":"Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Bernhardsson","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"John AG Briggs","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"James Nathan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Federica Mescia","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hongyi Zhang","author_inst":"CUH NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Petros Barmpounakis","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Nikos Demeris","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Richard Skells","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Paul Lyons","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Bradley","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Jean Pierre Allain","author_inst":"Diagnostics for the Real World EU Ltd"},{"author_name":"Kenneth GC Smith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"ig299@cam.ac.uk"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex G.

Unfortunately, standard SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols are invasive and rely on numerous items that can be subject to supply chain bottlenecks, and as such are not suitable for frequent repeat testing. Specifically, personal protective equipment (PPE), nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, the associated viral transport media (VTM), and kits for RNA isolation and purification have all been in short supply at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets and aerosols transmitted through person-to-person contact, and thus saliva may be a relevant medium for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Here we describe a saliva-based testing method that bypasses the need for RNA isolation\/purification. In experiments with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into saliva, this method has a limit of detection of 500-1000 viral particles per mL, rivalling the standard NP swab method, and initial studies also show excellent performance with 100 clinical samples. This saliva-based process is operationally simple, utilizes readily available materials, and can be easily implemented by existing testing sites, thus allowing for high-throughput, rapid, and repeat testing of large populations.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diana Ranoa","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Robin Holland","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Fadi G Alnaji","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Kelsie Green","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Leyi Wang","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Christopher Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Martin Burke","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Tim Fan","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Paul J Hergenrother","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"\u00d6rjan Dahlstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Bagge Carlson","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Anna J\u00f6ud","author_inst":"Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Bernhardsson","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"John AG Briggs","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"James Nathan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Federica Mescia","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hongyi Zhang","author_inst":"CUH NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Petros Barmpounakis","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Nikos Demeris","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Richard Skells","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Paul Lyons","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Bradley","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Jean Pierre Allain","author_inst":"Diagnostics for the Real World EU Ltd"},{"author_name":"Kenneth GC Smith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"ig299@cam.ac.uk"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex G.

Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng\/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, \"all RBD-down\" conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and\/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lihong Liu","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Wang","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Manoj S Nair","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Jian Yu","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Micah Rapp","author_inst":"Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Yang Luo","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Sahi","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Amir Figueroa","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology & Immunology Flow Cytometry Core, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Xinzheng V Guo","author_inst":"Human Immune Monitoring Core, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Cerutti","author_inst":"Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."},{"author_name":"Jude Bimela","author_inst":"Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason Gorman","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."},{"author_name":"Tongqing Zhou","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University"},{"author_name":"Peter D Kwong","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA"},{"author_name":"Joseph G Sodroski","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."},{"author_name":"Michael T Yin","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Zizhang Sheng","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Shapiro","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"David D Ho","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Kenneth GC Smith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"ig299@cam.ac.uk"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex G.

Despite its critical and multifunctional nature, the molecular details that underlie how N protein mediates these functions are poorly understood. Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to the function of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. N protein contains three intrinsically disordered regions and two folded domains. All three disordered regions are highly dynamic and contain regions of transient helicity that appear to act as local binding interfaces for protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions. The two folded domains do not significantly interact with one another, such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA binding protein. As observed for other proteins with similar molecular features, we found that N protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA. Polymer models predict that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We propose a simple model in which symmetry breaking through specific binding sites promotes the formation of metastable single-RNA condensate, as opposed to large multi-RNA phase separated droplets. We speculate that RNA compaction to form dynamic single-genome condensates may underlie the early stages of genome packaging. As such, assays that measure how compounds modulate phase separation could provide a convenient tool for identifying drugs that disrupt viral packaging.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasmine Cubuk","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jhullian J Alston","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"J.

Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus we demonstrate that, in addition to human ACE2, the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the twenty-two different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat and rabbit were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the three genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle entry was inefficient in cells bearing the ACE2 receptor from bats or birds the live virus was still able to enter these cells, albeit with markedly lower efficiency. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock and wildlife.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carina Conceicao","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Nazia Thakur","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Stacey Human","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"James T Kelly","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Leanne Logan","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Dagmara Bialy","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Sushant Bhat","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Phoebe Stevenson-Leggett","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrian Zagrajek","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Philippa Hollinghurst","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Michal Varga","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Christina Tsirigoti","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"John Hammond","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Erica Bickerton","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Holly J Shelton","author_inst":"The Pirbright institute"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Dietrich","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephen C Graham","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dalan Bailey","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael T Yin","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Zizhang Sheng","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Shapiro","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"David D Ho","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Kenneth GC Smith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"ig299@cam.ac.uk"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex G.

Key to SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development is unraveling the mechanisms driving high infectivity, broad tissue tropism and severe pathology. Our cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein reveals that the receptor binding domains (RBDs) tightly and specifically bind the essential free fatty acid (FFA) linoleic acid (LA) in three composite binding pockets.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 3a forms large conductance cation channels and present cryo-EM structures of dimeric and tetrameric 3a in lipid nanodiscs. 3a adopts a novel fold and is captured in a closed or inactivated state. A narrow bifurcated exterior pore precludes conduction and leads to a large polar cavity open to the cytosol. 3a function is conserved in a common variant among circulating SARS-CoV-2 that alters the channel pore. We identify 3a-like proteins in all Alpha- and Beta-coronaviruses that infect bats and humans, suggesting therapeutics targeting 3a could treat a range of coronaviral diseases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M Kern","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California Berkeley; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute; California Institute for Quantitative Biology ("},{"author_name":"Ben Sorum","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California Berkeley; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute; California Institute for Quantitative Biology ("},{"author_name":"Christopher M Hoel","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California Berkeley; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute; California Institute for Quantitative Biology ("},{"author_name":"Savitha Sridharan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California Berkeley; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Remis","author_inst":"California Institute for Quantitative Biology (QB3); Molecular Biophysics and Integrative Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Daniel B Toso","author_inst":"California Institute for Quantitative Biology (QB3)"},{"author_name":"Stephen G Brohawn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California Berkeley; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute; California Institute for Quantitative Biology ("},{"author_name":"Susan Cuvalay","author_inst":"Unit of Transfusion Medicine, Sanquin Blood Supply, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Ed Slot","author_inst":"Laboratory of Blood-borne Infections, Sanquin Blood Supply, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Francis H.

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 resulting in a global pandemic. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to induce a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human cells, leading to speculation about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit innate antiviral responses. However, innate antiviral responses are dynamic in nature and gene expression levels rapidly change within minutes to hours. In this study, we have performed a time series RNA-seq and selective immunoblot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung (Calu-3) cells to characterize early virus-host processes. SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated transcripts for type I IFNs and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) after 12 hours. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit type I IFN production and downstream antiviral signaling in human cells. Using exogenous stimuli, we discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to modulate IFN{beta} production and downstream expression of ISGs, such as IRF7 and IFIT1. Thus, data from our study indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved additional mechanisms, such as masking of viral nucleic acid sensing by host cells to mount a dampened innate antiviral response. Further studies are required to fully identify the range of immune-modulatory strategies of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSignificanceHighly pathogenic coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS have evolved proteins to shutdown antiviral responses. The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with its relatively low case-fatality rate have led to speculation about its ability to modulate antiviral responses. We show that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to block antiviral responses that are mounted by exogenous stimuli. Data from our study provide promising support for the use of recombinant type I IFN as combination therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our data also suggest that the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently modulate antiviral responses may be associated with its low case-fatality rate compared to other pathogenic CoVs that cause SARS and MERS.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arinjay Banerjee","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Daniel Richard","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Hassaan Maan","author_inst":"Vector Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Aguiar","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Nader El-Sayes","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.-M.

We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6-7 incipient phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple regions, in spite of their low frequency. In conclusion, the N and S antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are well conserved antigens, but new clades are emerging and may need to be included in future diagnostic and vaccine formulations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Dumonteil","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Claudia Herrera","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Richard","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Hassaan Maan","author_inst":"Vector Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Aguiar","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Nader El-Sayes","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.-M.

Enveloped viruses infect the host cell by cellular membrane fusion, a crucial mechanism required for virus replication. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, due to its primary interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell-surface receptor, is considered as a potential target for drug development. Based on in silico screening followed by in vitro studies, here we report that the existing FDA-approved Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of 130 nM. We provide evidence that although imatinib binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with an affinity at micromolar, i.e., 2.32 {+\/-} 0.9 M levels, imatinib does not directly inhibit the spike RBD:ACE2 interaction - suggesting a Bcr-Abl kinase-mediated fusion inhibition mechanism is responsible for the inhibitory action. We also show that imatinib inhibits other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV via fusion inhibition.

Mapping the variant strains and studying their pattern of evolution will provide better insights into the pandemic spread\n\nMethodsData on different SARS-CoV2 for WHO EMRO countries were obtained from the Chinese National Genomics Data Center (NGDC), Genbank and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) was performed to study the evolutionary relationship between the genomes. Variant calling, genome and variant alignment were performed to track the strains in each country. Evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis is used to explore the evolutionary hypothesis.\n\nFindingsOf the total 50 samples, 4 samples did not contain any variants. Variant calling identified 379 variants. Earliest strains are found in Iranian samples. Variant alignment indicates Iran samples have a low variant frequency. Saudi Arabia has formed an outgroup. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait were the most evolved genomes and are the countries with the highest number of cases per million.\n\nInterpretationIran was exposed to the virus earlier than other countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.\n\nFundingNone","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khalid M Bindayna","author_inst":"Arabian Gulf University"},{"author_name":"Shane Crinion","author_inst":"National University of Ireland Galway"},{"author_name":"Samavath Mallawarachchi","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ruzek","author_inst":"Veterinary Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Byron Martina","author_inst":"Artemis One Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sandun Fernando","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.-M.

Throughout its spread around the world, the viral genome continued acquiring new mutations and some of them became widespread. Among them, 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations in RdRp and S, respectively, became dominant in Europe and the US, which led to debates regarding their effects on the mutability and transmissibility of the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible differences between time-dependent variation of mutation densities (MDe) of viral strains that carry these two mutations and those that do not. Our analyses at the genome and gene level led to two important findings: First, time-dependent changes in the average MDe of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed different characteristics before and after the beginning of April, when daily new case numbers started levelling off. Second, this pattern was much delayed or even non-existent for the \"mutant\" (MT) strain that harbored both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations. Although these differences were not limited to a few hotspots, it is intriguing that the MDe increase is most evident in two critical genes, S and Orf1ab, which are also the genes that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype. The nature of these unexpected relationships warrant further research.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Do\u011fa Eskier","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute (iBG-Izmir)"},{"author_name":"Asl\u0131 Suner","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6khan Karak\u016blah","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"Yavuz Oktay","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"Byron Martina","author_inst":"Artemis One Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sandun Fernando","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.-M.
