Currently, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of molecular assays for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection which are highly expensive and require specialized laboratory equipment. This is a limitation in mass testing and in low resource settings. SARS CoV-2 IgG\/IgM antibody tests have had poor diagnostic performance that do not guarantee their use in diagnostics. In this study we demonstrate a concept of using a combination of RDTs in an algorithm to improve their performance for diagnostics. Method: Eighty six (86) EDTA whole blood samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2 positive cases admitted at Masaka and Mbarara Regional Referral Hospitals in Uganda. These were categorized from day when confirmed positive as follows; category A (0-3 days, 10 samples), category B (4-7 days, 20 samples), Category C (8-17 days, 11 samples) and Category D (18-28 days, 20 samples). Plasma was prepared, transported to the testing laboratory and stored at -200C prior to testing. A total of 13 RDTS were tested following manufacturers instructions. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel exported to STATA for computation of sensitivity and specificity. We computed for all possible combinations of 2 of the 13 RDTS (13C2) that were evaluated in parallel algorithm. Results: The individual sensitives of the RDTs ranged between 74% and 18% and there was a general increasing trend across the categories with days since PCR confirmation. A total of 78 possible combinations of the RDTs to be used in parallel was computated. The combinations of the 2 RDTS improved the sensitivities to 90%. Discussion: We demonstrate that use of RDTs in combinations can improve their overall sensitivity. This approach when used on a wider range of combination of RDTs may yield combinations that can give sensitivities that are of diagnostics relevance in mass testing and low resource setting.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Grace Esther Kushemererwa","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Ismail Kayongo","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Patrick Semanda","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Hellen Nansumba","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Christine Namulindwa","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Iga Tadeo","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Wilson Nyegenye","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Charles Kiyaga","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Patrick Agwa Ogwok","author_inst":"Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Susan Nabadda","author_inst":"Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Isaac Ssewanyana","author_inst":"Central Public Health Laboratories and Infectious Diseases Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20140731","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 in human sewage in Santa Catalina, Brazil, November 2019","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20140731","rel_abs":"We analysed human sewage located in Florianopolis (Santa Catalina, Brazil) from late October until the Brazil lockdown on early March.

Strained healthcare providers make difficult decisions on patient triage, treatment and care management on a daily basis. Policy makers have imposed social distancing measures to slow the disease, at a steep economic price. We design analytical tools to support these decisions and combat the pandemic. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, predict its mortality, forecast its evolution, and ultimately alleviate its impact. By leveraging cohort-level clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to reallocate ventilators and alleviate shortages. Our results have been used at the clinical level by several hospitals to triage patients, guide care management, plan ICU capacity, and re-distribute ventilators. At the policy level, they are currently supporting safe back-to-work policies at a major institution and equitable vaccine distribution planning at a major pharmaceutical company, and have been integrated into the US Center for Disease Control's pandemic forecast.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dimitris Bertsimas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Leonard Boussioux","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Cory Wright","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Arthur Delarue","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Digalakis Jr.","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Jacquillat","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Driss Lahlou Kitane","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Galit Lukin","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael L Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Luca Mingardi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Omid Nohadani","author_inst":"Benefits Science Technologies"},{"author_name":"Agni Orfanoudaki","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Theodore Papalexopoulos","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ivan Paskov","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jean Pauphilet","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Omar Skali Lami","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bartolomeo Stellato","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hamza Tazi Bouardi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Villalobos Carballo","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Holly Wiberg","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Zeng","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20056507","rel_title":"Chronic treatment with hydroxychloroquine and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20056507","rel_abs":"Background: Hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ) is being scrutinized for repositioning in the treatment and prevention of SARS-Cov-2 infection. This antimalarial drug is also chronically used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases. Methods: By analyzing the Portuguese anonymized data on private and public based medical prescriptions we have identified all cases chronically receiving HCQ for the management of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. Additionally, we have detected all laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and all laboratory confirmed negative cases in the Portuguese population (mandatorily registered in a centrally managed database). Cross linking the two sets of data has allowed us to compare the proportion of HCQ chronic treatment (at least 2 grams per month) in laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with laboratory confirmed negative cases. Results: Out of 26,815 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 77 (0.29%) were chronically treated with HCQ, while 1,215 (0.36%) out of 333,489 negative patients were receiving it chronically (P=0.04). After adjustment for age, sex, and chronic treatment with corticosteroids and\/or immunosuppressants, the odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for chronic treatment with HCQ has been 0.51 (0.37-0.70). Conclusions: Our data suggest that chronic treatment with HCQ confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Ferreira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade do Porto, Centro Hospitalar Universitario Sao Joao, Porto, Hospital Santa Isabel, Marco de Canaveses"},{"author_name":"Antonio Oliveira-e-Silva","author_inst":"Hospital de Braga, Braga"},{"author_name":"Paulo Bettencourt","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade do Porto, Hospital CUF, Porto"},{"author_name":"Arthur Delarue","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Digalakis Jr.","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Jacquillat","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Driss Lahlou Kitane","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Galit Lukin","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael L Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Luca Mingardi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Omid Nohadani","author_inst":"Benefits Science Technologies"},{"author_name":"Agni Orfanoudaki","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Theodore Papalexopoulos","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ivan Paskov","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jean Pauphilet","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Omar Skali Lami","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bartolomeo Stellato","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hamza Tazi Bouardi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Villalobos Carballo","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Holly Wiberg","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Zeng","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20140632","rel_title":"Comparison of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adult COVID-19 and influenza patients: a prospective observational study","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20140632","rel_abs":"Objective We compared the clinical characteristics, findings and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or influenza to detect relevant differences. Methods From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at the HUS Jorvi Hospital, Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for at least 30 days from admission. Results We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs 15 [45%], P=0.03 and 1 [4%] vs 10 [30%], P=0.008). In chest x-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], P < 0.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs 19 [58%], P=0.003 and 8 [29%] vs 2 [6%], P=0.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (6 days [IQR 4-21] vs 3 [2-4], P<0.001). Conclusion Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raija Auvinen","author_inst":"HUS Helsinki University Hospital, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"},{"author_name":"Hanna Nohynek","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"},{"author_name":"Ritva Syrj\u00e4nen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"},{"author_name":"Jukka Ollgren","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"},{"author_name":"Tuija Kerttula","author_inst":"HUS Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jarkko M\u00e4ntyl\u00e4","author_inst":"HUS Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Niina Ikonen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Anu Haveri","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Kirsi Skogberg","author_inst":"HUS Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Agni Orfanoudaki","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Theodore Papalexopoulos","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ivan Paskov","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jean Pauphilet","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Omar Skali Lami","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bartolomeo Stellato","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hamza Tazi Bouardi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Villalobos Carballo","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Holly Wiberg","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Zeng","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20135319","rel_title":"Baricitinib restrains the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20135319","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

These immune mediators are transcriptionally regulated by JAK-STAT molecular pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules. Here, we provide evidences on the efficacy of baricitinib, a JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor, in correcting the immune abnormalities observed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, we demonstrate a significant reduction in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a rapid recovery in circulating T and B cell frequencies and an increased antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in baricitinib-treated patients.

Patients admitted over a matched interval in the previous 5 years were used as a comparator cohort (n = 14961). Main outcome measures: Patient demography, biochemical markers of clinical acuity and 7-day hospital inpatient mortality. Results: Non-covid-19 acute medical admissions reduced by a mean 43.8% (95% CI 27.3, 59.4) across all 3 sites in comparison to the mean of the preceding 5 years P < 0.001. The reduction in admissions predominated in the over 75 age category and a greater proportion arrived by emergency ambulance transport.

Here we estimate the IFR of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC), the first epidemic center in the United States where the IFR remains unclear. Methods: We developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in NYC during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the IFR for all ages overall and for 5 age groups (i.e. <25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75+ years) separately, during March 1 - June 6, 2020 (i.e., before NYC began its phased reopening). Findings: During March 1 - June 6, 2020, 205,639 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed and 21,447 confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths occurred among NYC residents. We estimated an overall IFR of 1.39% (95% Credible Interval: 1.04-1.77%) in NYC. Estimated IFR for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and 75+ years) was much higher than the younger age groups and about double estimates reported for elsewhere. In particular, weekly IFR was estimated as high as 6.7% for 65-74 year-olds and 19.1% for 75+ year-olds. Interpretation: These results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-associated deaths in NYC and thus likely more accurately reflect the true, higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than previously reported elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wan Yang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sasikiran Kandula","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Mary Huynh","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Sharon K Greene","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Van Wye","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Wenhui Li","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Hiu Tai Chan","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Emily McGibbon","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Alice Yeung","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Don Olson","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Anne Fine","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Chiara Musiu","author_inst":"Immunology Section of Medicine Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Caligola","author_inst":"Immunology Section of Medicine Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Pinton","author_inst":"Immunology Section of Medicine Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorena Torroni","author_inst":"Unit of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Infectious Disease Section of Diagnostics and Public Health Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, "},{"author_name":"Enrico Polati","author_inst":"Anestesia and Rianimazione Section of Surgery, Dentistry, Maternity and Infant Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy"},{"author_name":"Katia Donadello","author_inst":"Anestesia and Rianimazione Section of Surgery, Dentistry, Maternity and Infant Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy"},{"author_name":"Simonetta Friso","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Section B of Medicine Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Pizzolo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Section B of Medicine Department of University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy"},{"author_name":"Manuela Iezzi","author_inst":"CAST Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

In terms of coronavirus transmission, the relatively low death rates in some countries could be due to low intrinsic (e.g. low population density) or imposed contact rates (e.g. non-pharmaceutical interventions) among individuals, or because fewer people were exposed or susceptible to infection (e.g. smaller populations). Here we develop a flexible empirical model (skew-logistic) to distinguish among these possibilities. We find that countries reporting fewer deaths did not generally have intrinsically lower rates of transmission and epidemic growth, and flatter epidemic curves. Rather, countries with fewer deaths locked down earlier, had shorter epidemics that peaked sooner, and smaller populations. Consequently, as lockdowns are eased we expect, and are starting to see, a resurgence of COVID-19 across Europe.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Russell C.H.

Stringency and efficacy of imposed measures vary due to diversity of organizational cultures and ingrained societal practices, but also universally reflect the standpoint from which protecting public health and saving economy are seen as contradictory objectives. We analyzed cumulative deaths per capita and cumulative mobility reduction related to the decrease of economic activity in terms of Pareto optimality to show that as long as epidemic suppression is the aim, the trade-off between the death toll and economic loss is illusory: high death toll correlates with deep lockdown and thus, very likely, with severe economic downturn. We explained this effect by analyzing national epidemic trajectories in the mobility reduction vs. reproduction number (R) plane. When the number of daily new infections is high, mobility reduction is the only way to bring R below 1, but when new infections become sporadic, the epidemic can be suppressed by efficient testing complemented by relatively mild restrictions. South American trajectories suggest that lifting mobility restrictions at R [&ge;] 1 may ultimately lead to the \"herd immunity scenario\", in which transient lockdown only adds economic costs to an inevitably high death toll.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marek Kochanczyk","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Lipniacki","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"John S.

As a charity that endeavours to support bladder cancer (BC) patients and improve outcomes, Action Bladder Cancer UK (ABCUK) designed and administered a SurveyMonkey survey to investigate the prevalence of such disruption for BC patients. From 22nd April to 18th June 2020, 142 BC patients responded. Across all patient groups, 46.8% of patients described disruption to their treatment or follow-up. For non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) patients, disruptions included postponement of: initial transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) (33.3%), subsequent TURBT (40.0%), and surveillance cystoscopy (58.1%). For NMIBC patients undergoing intravesical therapy, 68.4% experienced treatment postponements or curtailments. For muscle-invasive BC patients, 57.1% had experienced postponement of cystectomy and 14.3% had been changed from cystectomy to radiotherapy. Half of patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy also experienced disruption. Despite the survey's limitations, we have demonstrated considerable disruption to the care of BC patients during the UK Covid-19 pandemic. To avoid a repeat, the UK BC community should define effective contingent ways of working ready for a possible second wave of Covid-19, or any other such threat.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Spencer-Bowdage","author_inst":"Action Bladder Cancer UK"},{"author_name":"Jeannie Rigby","author_inst":"Action Bladder Cancer UK"},{"author_name":"Jackie O'Kelly","author_inst":"Action Bladder Cancer UK"},{"author_name":"Phil Kelly","author_inst":"Action Bladder Cancer UK"},{"author_name":"Mark Page","author_inst":"Action Bladder Cancer UK"},{"author_name":"Caroline Raw","author_inst":"Action Bladder Cancer UK"},{"author_name":"Paula Allchorne","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Harper","author_inst":"Leaders in Oncology Care, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Crew","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK."},{"author_name":"Roger Kockelbergh","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UK.

Objective: To examine prevalence of comorbidities, rates of hospitalization and survival, and incidence of CV manifestations of COVID-19 in a predominantly AA population in south metropolitan Chicago. Design, Setting, Participants: This was an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients encountered from March 16 to April 16, 2020 at the University of Chicago. Deidentified data were obtained from an institutional data warehouse. Group comparisons and logistic regression modeling based on baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and diagnostic testing was performed. Exposures: COVID-19 was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab testing and clinical management was at the discretion of treating physicians. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included incident CV manifestations of COVID-19 in the context of overall cardiology service utilization. Results: During the 30 day study period, 1008 patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 689 had available encounter data. Of these, 596 (87%) were AA and 356 (52%) were hospitalized, of which 319 (90%) were AA. Age > 60 years, tobacco use, BMI >40 kg\/m2, diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin use, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AF) were more common in hospitalized patients. Age > 60 years, tobacco use, CAD, and AF were associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality along with several elevated initial laboratory markers including troponin, NT-proBNP, blood urea nitrogen, and ferritin. Despite this, cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 were uncommon, coincident with a 69% decrease in cardiology service utilization. For hospitalized patients, median length of stay was 6.2 days (3.4-11.9 days) and mortality was 13%. AA patients were more commonly hospitalized, but without increased mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this AA-predominant experience from south metropolitan Chicago, CV comorbidities and chronic diseases were highly prevalent and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality. Insulin-requiring DM and CKD emerged as novel predictors for hospitalization. Despite the highest rate of comorbidities reported to date, CV manifestations of COVID-19 and mortality were relatively low. The unexpectedly low rate of mortality merits further study.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ann B.

This study explores surveillance strategies for COVID-19 containment based on polymerase chain reaction tests. Methods: Using a dynamic SEIR-type model to simulate the initial dynamics of a COVID-19 introduction, we investigate COVID-19 surveillance strategies among healthcare workers, hospital patients, and community members. We estimate surveillance sensitivity as the probability of COVID-19 detection using a hypergeometric sampling process. We identify test allocation strategies that maximise the probability of COVID-19 detection across different testing capacities. We use Beijing, China as a case study. Findings: Surveillance subgroups are more sensitive in detecting COVID-19 transmission when they are defined by more COVID-19 specific symptoms. In this study, fever clinics have the highest surveillance sensitivity, followed by respiratory departments. With a daily testing rate of 0.07\/1000 residents, via exclusively testing at fever clinic and respiratory departments, there would have been 598 [95% eCI: 35, 2154] and 1373 [95% eCI: 47, 5230] cases in the population by the time of first case detection, respectively. Outbreak detection can occur earlier by including non-syndromic subgroups, such as younger adults in the community, as more testing capacity becomes available. Interpretation: A multi-layer approach that considers both the surveillance sensitivity and administrative constraints can help identify the optimal allocation of testing resources and thus inform COVID-19 surveillance strategies.

Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number Ro = 2.4 +\/- 0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.

Whether the characteristic findings of Chest CT could differentiate confirmed COVID-19 cases from other positive nucleic acid test (NAT)-negative patients has not been rigorously evaluated. Purpose We aim to test whether chest computed tomography (CT) manifestation of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can be differentiated by a radiologist or a computer-based CT image analysis system. Methods We conducted a retrospective case-control study that included 52 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 80 non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients between 20 December, 2019 and 10 February, 2020. The chest CT images were evaluated by radiologists in a double blind fashion. A computer-based image analysis system (uAI system, Lianying Inc., Shanghai, China) detected the lesions in 18 lung segments defined by Boyden classification system and calculated the infected volume in each segment. The number and volume of lesions detected by radiologist and computer system was compared with Chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Results The main CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multi-lobar\/segmental peripheral ground-glass opacities and patchy air space infiltrates. The case and control groups were similar in demographics, comorbidity, and clinical manifestations. There was no significant difference in eight radiologist identified CT image features between the two groups of patients. There was also no difference in the absolute and relative volume of infected regions in each lung segment. Conclusions We documented the non-differentiating nature of initial chest CT image between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia with suspected symptoms. Our results do not support CT findings replacing microbiological diagnosis as a critical criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis. Our findings may prompt re-evaluation of isolated patients without laboratory confirmation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qingli Dou","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Jiangping Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Wenwu Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Gu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ting Hsu","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ching Ho","author_inst":"St George Hospital Sydney"},{"author_name":"Hoi Sin Tong","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wing Yan Yu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chien-Chang Lee","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Segolene Debiesse","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Penelope Bourgoin","author_inst":"Immunotech Beckman Coulter"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Veyrenche","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Constance Renault","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Bret Caroline","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Bourdin Arnaud","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Edouard TUAILLON","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Ayodeji Adegunsoye","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Wu","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bhakti Patel","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica E.

The disease has already affected over 6 million individuals, with over 400,000 fatalities. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in feces of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using RT-PCR tests. It is however, still unclear as to whether or not live SARS-CoV-2 virus is actually present in feces of these patients. In this rapid review, we systematically analyzed literature to establish any evidence of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in fecal samples of COVID-19 patients. We identified 4 studies (one case report, 2 case series and 1 cohort study) where the SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from fecal samples of COVID-19 patients using culture techniques. Therefore, there is some evidence COVID-19 could shed live SARS-CoV-2 virus via the gastro-intestinal tract. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings, as well as to determine its potential for disease transmission and infection, and possible implications for COVID-19 discharge and isolation policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Prabjot Sehmi","author_inst":"University of Nairobi"},{"author_name":"Isaac Cheruiyot","author_inst":"University of Nairobi"},{"author_name":"Oluwasijibomi Damola Faleti","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Huang","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gang Xiao","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Lyu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hoi Sin Tong","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wing Yan Yu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chien-Chang Lee","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Segolene Debiesse","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Penelope Bourgoin","author_inst":"Immunotech Beckman Coulter"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Veyrenche","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Constance Renault","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Bret Caroline","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Bourdin Arnaud","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Edouard TUAILLON","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Ayodeji Adegunsoye","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Wu","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bhakti Patel","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica E.

In December 2019, a new highly contagious coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China. SARS-CoV-2 causes a potentially lethal human respiratory infection, COVID-19, that is associated with fever and cough and can progress to pneumonia and dyspnea in severe cases. Since the virus emerged, it has spread rapidly, reaching all continents around the world. A previous study has shown that, despite being the best alternative in the current pandemic context, social distancing measures alone may not be sufficient to prevent COVID-19 spread, and the overall impact of the virus is of great concern. The present study aims to describe the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 672 cities with cases of COVID-19, as well as to determine a predictive model for the number of cases. We analyzed data from cities with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 until June 26, 2020. It was observed that cities with confirmed cases of the disease are present in all Brazilian states, affecting 36.5% of the municipalities in Rio de Janeiro State. The inhabitants in cities with reported cases of COVID-19 represent more than 73.1% of the Brazilian population. Stratifying the age groups of the inhabitants and accounting for the percentage of women and men does not affect COVID-19 incidence (confirmed cases\/100,000 inhabitants). The demographic density, the MHDI and the per capita income of the municipalities with cases of COVID-19 do not affect disease incidence. In addition, if conditions are maintained, our model predicts 2,358,703 (2,172,930 to 2,544,477) cumulative cases on July 25, 2020.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isadora C Carneiro","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Eloiza D Ferreira","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Jana\u00edna C da Silva","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia de Tumores, Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana, UNIOESTE"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Soares","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Daisy M Strottmann","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Guilherme F Silveira","author_inst":"Instituto Carlos Chagas - Fiocruz\/PR"},{"author_name":"Widyastuti Widyastuti","author_inst":"Public Health Office of Jakarta Province"},{"author_name":"Wing Yan Yu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chien-Chang Lee","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Segolene Debiesse","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Penelope Bourgoin","author_inst":"Immunotech Beckman Coulter"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Veyrenche","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Constance Renault","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Bret Caroline","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Bourdin Arnaud","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Edouard TUAILLON","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Ayodeji Adegunsoye","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Wu","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bhakti Patel","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica E.

A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g., age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models.

Emerging emergence has suggested that several factors may be associated with increased risk from severe outcomes or death from COVID-19. Clinical risk prediction tools have significant potential to generate individualised assessment of risk and may be useful for population stratification and other use cases. Methods and analysis: We will use a prospective open cohort study of routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England in the QResearch database. The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality (in or out-of-hospital) defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, or death occurring in a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 24th January and 30th April 2020. Our primary outcome in adults is COVID-19 mortality (including out of hospital and in hospital deaths). We will also examine COVID-19 hospitalisation in children. Time-to-event models will be developed in the training data to derive separate risk equations in adults (19-100 years) for males and females for evaluation of risk of each outcome within the 3-month follow-up period (24th January to 30th April 2020), accounting for competing risks. Predictors considered will include age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, pre-existing medical co-morbidities, and concurrent medication. Measures of performance (prediction errors, calibration and discrimination) will be determined in the test data for men and women separately and by ten-year age group. For children, descriptive statistics will be undertaken if there are currently too few serious events to allow development of a risk model. The final model will be externally evaluated in (a) geographically separate practices and (b) other relevant datasets as they become available. Ethics and dissemination: The project has ethical approval and the results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Hippisley-Cox","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ashley Kieran Clift","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol AC Coupland","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Ruth Keogh","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karla Diaz-Ordaz","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ewen Harrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hayward","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nisha Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Health and Social Care"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kieran Benger","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"David Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aziz Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Doriane Miller","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dinesh J.

This meant that 890 million students in 114 countries would be affected by the closure of their educational institutes, affecting their mental health. Mental health disorders are suggested to have a well-correlated link to suicide which is the third most leading cause of death worldwide amongst children aged 15-19 years. According to WHO, 'health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease'. Hence the isolation brought about by SARS-CoV-2 is postulated to cause anxiety, fear, and depression amongst the pediatric population, due to the loss of socialization and separation from friends. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we highlight the major mental health issues in children aged 2-18 years, along with their causes, effects, and potential solutions to tackle these problems.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mir Ibrahim Sajid","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Javeria Tariq","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Akbar Waheed","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Dure Najaf","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Samira Shabbir Balouch","author_inst":"King Edward Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sajid Abaidullah","author_inst":"King Edward Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ewen Harrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hayward","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nisha Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Health and Social Care"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kieran Benger","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"David Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aziz Sheikh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Valabhji","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"John Robson","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Frank Kee","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Peter Johnson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Susan Jebb","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tony Williams","author_inst":"Working Fit, Ltd."},{"author_name":"David Coggon","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Doriane Miller","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dinesh J.
