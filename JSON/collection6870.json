This study is the first in the world about the psychological status of the medical team during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: To study the correlation between risk factors and general symptom index (GSI) score of medical team members who support Wuhan against COVID-19. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Population-based. Participants: Anhui Province sent a total of eight medical teams,including 1382 members,to support Hubei Province. We adopted a stratified sampling method and selected the fourth team sent by Anhui Provincial Hospital, with a total of 137 members as our subjects. Exposures: Four main exposures were collected, including basic information, preparations before going to Wuhan, life issues and working issues after going to Wuhan. Main Outcomes and Measures: The GSI score of SCL-90 scale was used to reflect the frequency and intensity of psychological symptoms. We made the hypothesis of this study before data collection. Results: 110(80.29%) members completed the questionnaire, of which, 77(70.00%) female and 33(30.00%) male. When adjusted age, gender and covariates, DC, LCWT had a positive correlations with GSI score(beta was 10.17, 95%CI was 3.30 to 17.04 for DC, P=0.00<0.05;beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71 for LCWT, P =0.04<0.05;respectively), RBT had a negative positive correlation with GSI score (beta was -28.09, 95%CI was -45.79 to -10.40, P=0.00<0.05), AoBI did not had a correlation with GSI score (beta was 11.55, 95%CI was 0.40 to 22.71, P=0.16>0.05). When adjusted covariates, DC had a positive and RBT had a negative correlation with GSI score of female (beta was 13.20, 95%CI was 4.55 to 21.85, P=0.00<0.05; beta was -57.85, 95%CI was -94.52 to -21.18, P=0.00<0.05; respectively), but for male was not (P=0.59>0.05, P=0.08>0.05, respectively), LCWT and AoBI didn't had correlation with GSI score between genders (P>0.05). Conclusions and Relevance: Improving DC, RBT and decreasing LCWT can reduce the GSI score. AoBI didn't affect the psychological status; male members have a more stable mood than female. Whether other countries medical team has the same result still needs further research.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhang Jinlong","author_inst":"1.Rehabilitation Department, The first affiliated Hospital of university of science and technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)2.

Therefore, early detection of infection is the key to early isolation and treatment. Direct detection of the virus itself has advantages over indirect detection. Currently, the most sensitive and commercially validated method for COVID-19 testing is RT-qPCR, designed to detect amplified virus-specific RNA. Reliable testing has proven to be a bottleneck in early diagnosis of virus infection in all countries dealing with the pandemic. Significant performance and quality issues with available testing kits have caused confusion and serious health risks. In order to provide better understanding of the Quality and performance of COVID-19 RNA detection kits on the market, we designed a system to evaluate the specificity (quantitation), sensitivity (LOD) and robustness of the kits using positive RNA and pseudovirus controls based on COVID-19 genomic sequence. We evaluated 8 Nucleic Acid qPCR Kits approved in China, some of which are also approved in the US and EU. Our study showed that half of these 8 kits lack 1:1 linear relationship for virus RNA copy: qPCR signal. Of the 4 with linear response, 2 demonstrated sensitivity at 1 Copy viral RNA\/Reaction, suitable for early detection of virus infection. Furthermore, we established the best RNA extraction, handling and qPCR procedures allowing highly sensitive and consistent performance using BGI qPCR kits. Our study provides an effective method to assess and compare performance quality of all COVID-19 nucleic acid testing kits, globally.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Surace Kapitula","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Zhuopu Jiang","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Jianhao Jiang","author_inst":"Gene Pharma"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhu","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Xiangyong Chen","author_inst":"Gene Pharma"},{"author_name":"Claudia Qiao Lin","author_inst":"Jade Biomedical LTD"},{"author_name":"Chen Xia","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Hong Na","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Jing Xiaolei","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20073767","rel_title":"COVID-19 in people living with human immunodeficiency virus: A case series of 33 patients","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20073767","rel_abs":"Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still scarce.

Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures. Conserving reagents by pooling samples in low-probability settings is proposed, but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity. Methods: We tested an alternate approach (FACT) by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube. This protocol was evaluated by serial incubation of a respiratory swab in up to 10 tubes. The analytics validity of this concept was demonstrated in a five-sample mini pool set-up. It was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients (five-sample pools) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home (ten-sample pools). Results: Serial incubation of a respiratory swab in up to 10 tubes did not lead to a significant decline in viral concentration. The novel FACT-protocol did not cause a false negative result in a five-sample mini-pool setup, with non-significantly differing Ct values between single sample and mini-pool NAT. In two routine applications, all mini pools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified. Conclusions: Our proposed FACT- protocol did not cause a significant loss in analytic or diagnostic sensitivity compared to single sample testing in multiple setups. It reduced the amount of reagents needed by up to 40%, and also reduced hands-on time. This method could enhance testing efficiency, especially in groups with a low pretest-probability, such as systemically relevant professional groups.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Schmidt","author_inst":"German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Frankfurt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Hoehl","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology, University Hospital, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Berger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology, University Hospital, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heinz Zeichhardt","author_inst":"Institut fuer Qualitaetssicherung in der Virusdiagnostik - IQVD der GBD mbH, Berlin, Germany;"},{"author_name":"Kai Hourfar","author_inst":"German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Frankfurt, Germany."},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"University Hospital, Goethe University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Erhard Seifried","author_inst":"German Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Frankfurt, Germany."},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Directional Hospital Management"},{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"University Hospital of Padova, Department of Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Markus Mueller","author_inst":"Gemeinschaftspraxis Schwabstrasse 26, Schwabstrasse 26, D-70197 Stuttgart, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katja Roemer","author_inst":"Gemeinschaftspraxis Gotenring, Gotenring 27, D-50679 Koeln, Germany"},{"author_name":"Knud Schewe","author_inst":"ICH Study Center Hamburg, Glockengiesserwall 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Hoffmann","author_inst":"ICH Study Center Hamburg, Glockengiesserwall 1, D-20095 Hamburg; University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3, D-24105 Kiel, "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20082479","rel_title":"Effectiveness of the strategies implemented in SriLanka for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20082479","rel_abs":"In order to bring the new coronavirus pandemic in the country under control, the government of Sri Lanka implemented a set of control strategies including social distancing, quarantine, lockdowns, travel restrictions and isolation of villages.

There is no known effective therapy for the disease. Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine\/Azithromycin (HY\/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns regarding the potential risk of QT prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). Methods: This is a multicenter retrospective study of 251 patients with COVID-19 treated with HY\/AZ. We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. Results: QTc prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc prolongation to > 500 ms, a known marker of high risk for TdP had developed in 15.9% of patients. One patient developed TdP requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc of patients exhibiting QTc prolongation of > 60 ms was normal. Conclusion: The combination of HY\/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life threating arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY\/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ehud Chorin","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lalit Wadhwani","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Silvia Magnani","author_inst":"San Paolo University Hospital, Milan Italy"},{"author_name":"Matthew Dai","author_inst":"NYU Langone Healtha"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20073379","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine application is associated with a decreased mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20073379","rel_abs":"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high mortality. The most urgent thing is to find effective treatments. Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine application may be associated with a decreased risk of death in critically ill COVID-19 patients and what is potential mechanism. Design, Setting and Patients: This retrospective study included all 568 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by pathogen laboratory tests despite antiviral treatment and had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, PAO2\/FIO2 <300 with need of mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, between February 1 of 2020 to April 8 of 2020. All 568 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them additionally received oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days). Primary endpoint is mortality of patients, and inflammatory cytokines levels were compared between hydroxychloroquine and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital death and hospital stay time (day) were obtained, level of inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) was measured and compared between HCQ and NHCQ treatments. RESULTS: The median age of 568 critically ill patients is 68 (57, 76) years old with 37.0% being female. Mortalities are 18.8% (9\/48) in HCQ group and 45.8% (238\/520) in NHCQ group (p<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4 - 14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (p<0.05). The level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly lowered from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg\/mL at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg\/ml (p<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with a decreased mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine should be prescribed for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients to save lives.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Yu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Dao Wen Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Chenze Li","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Matthew Dai","author_inst":"NYU Langone Healtha"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20082537","rel_title":"Mathematical Model to Study Early COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics in Sri Lanka","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20082537","rel_abs":"Background: World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March. Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a cluster epidemic with a specific group of overseas returnees and their contacts. The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model to predict the epidemic in Sri Lanka incorporating measures taken for social distancing and prevention of social gatherings. Methods: A hybrid model incorporating both exponential and polynomial features was developed and parameters were estimated. The developed model was validated using the datasets of three reference countries. Finally, the model was applied to the Sri Lankan data to simulate the epidemic behaviour. Additional features were incorporated to the model to examine the effects of current control measures. Findings: Sri Lanka will have a peak of 177 COVID-19 active cases at the end of second incubation period from the index case of our projection, if the same trend continues. At 10% risk, we project a peak of 263 COVID-19 active cases at the end of third incubation period, and a peak of 353 at the end of fourth incubation period. Should the risk level reach 20%, the peak will be above 1000 active cases after 90 days. Simulations incorporating control measures predict that, deviation from the control measures currently in place could trigger exponential behaviour of the epidemic.   Interpretation: The hybrid model combining exponential and polynomial functions showed promising results to predict COVID-19 epidemic. Projections indicate that any early relaxation of control measures is not advisable. This methodological approach can be replicated in other settings at the initial stages of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanjeewa Nishantha Perera","author_inst":"Research & Development Centre for Mathematical Modeling, Department of Mathematics, University of Colombo, Colombo 03, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Naleen C Ganegoda","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Dhammika Deepani Siriwardhana","author_inst":"Department of Disability Studies, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Ragama, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Manuj C Weerasinghe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20075085","rel_title":"How urgent do intravitreal anti-VEGF injections need to be to justify the risk of transmitting COVID-19?

Method: We performed probability calculations to estimate COVID-19 infection status and likelihood of disease transmission among neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients and health care workers during anti-VEGF procedures, at various community prevalence levels of COVID-19. We then applied the expected burden of COVID-19 illness and death expressed through health-adjusted life-years (HALYs) lost. We compared these results to the expected disease burden of severe visual impairment if sight protecting anti-VEGF injections were not performed. Results: Our calculations suggest a wide range of contexts where the benefits of treatment to prevent progression to severe visual impairment or blindness are greater than the expected harms to the patient and immediate health care team due to COVID-19. For example, the benefits of treatment outweigh harms when the chance of progression to severe visual impairment is >0.37% for all scenarios where COVID-19 prevalence was 2000 per million, even when the effective attack rate in the clinical setting is very high (5-43%). Conclusion: Unless COVID-19 prevalence is very high, the reduced disease burden from avoiding visual impairment outweighs the expected HALYs lost from COVID-19 transmission. This finding is driven by the fact that HALYs lost when someone suffers severe visual impairment for 5 years are equivalent to nearly 400 moderate cases of infectious disease lasting 2 weeks each.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt James Boyd","author_inst":"Adapt Research Ltd, Reefton, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Daniel Andrew Richard Scott","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Gisborne Hospital, Hauora Tairawhiti, Gisborne, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"David Michael Squirrell","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Greenlane Clinical Centre, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Graham Ashley Wilson","author_inst":"Matai Lab, Gisborne, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Eric Shulman","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Nadeau-Routhier","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"ophthalmology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20075119","rel_title":"Cohort profile: Preliminary experience of 500 COVID-19 postive cases at a South West London District General Hospital.","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20075119","rel_abs":"This retrospective cohort analysis, reports the demographic data and early outcome of the first 500 patients who were admitted to a District General Hospital in South West London, UK and tested positive to COVID-19. The patients were admitted between 10 January and 10 April 2020; with the first COVID-19 positive diagnosis on 6 March. A surge in admissions started around the 15 March and peaked at the beginning of April. 56.8% of the admissions were male and 43.2% were female. The average age of the 500 admissions was 69.32 years (SD 19.23 years, range 1 week to 99.21 years). By the morning of 14 April 2020, 199 patients had been discharged (Female 89, Male 111), 163 patients had died (female 61, male 102) and 131 remained as in-patients (female 66, male 71). Fewer than one in twenty deaths occurred in patients below the age of 50 years, in either gender. Mortality rose dramatically, for both genders, after the age of sixty with males being almost twice as vulnerable to dying, as females, during the 7th decade. Males older than their mid-fifties were more likely to die than leave hospital. The same applied to females beyond their mid seventies. We did not see any evidence of a poorer outcome associated with a lower decile for Index of Multiple Deprivation or convincing evidence that any Ethnic minority groups were more likely to die than the White subgroups. When compared to the equivalent medical conditions, normally treated in the early spring, COVID-19 has an increased mortality, adversely affecting more men and an older population. The mean duration from admission to discharge was 11.29 days (SD 11.50 days). For admission to death, the mean interval was 11.72 days (SD 11.05 days). 62 of the 500 admissions required ventilator support. Of this subgroup, 71% were male and 29% were female. By the morning of the 14 April, no female over the age of 60 had left the intensive care unit alive and no male over the age of 50 had left the intensive care unit alive. At this time-point, 1.2% of the 500 admitted patients had returned alive from the intensive care units, following a period of ventilator support. This figure will rise if prolonged ventilator and renal support proves effective. While only providing a snapshot of a relatively small number of patients, reviewed over a short time period, from a small geographic area, the data supports the view that the younger members of society are less vulnerable to the adverse sequelae of COVID-19 infection and that any return to normal work and social activities should be considered initially for the individuals who are less than 40-50 years of age. There is an ongoing need for analyses on larger patient cohorts using both demographic and detailed clinical data.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard E Field","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Irrum Afzal","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"John Dixon","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vipul R Patel","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Putul Sarkar","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James E Marsh","author_inst":"Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert Knots","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Roi Bar-Cohen","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20082503","rel_title":"Latent Blowout of COVID-19 Globally: An Effort to Healthcare Alertness via Medical GIS Approach","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20082503","rel_abs":"Since January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been escalating from North America to Asia.

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in COVID-19 patients with death or survival. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19 using a fixed or random-effects model. Results: In the meta-analysis of 18 studies, which included a total of 2,862 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 30.9 IU\/L in the COVID-19 patients with death and 26.3 IU\/L in the COVID-19 patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). The pooled mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 45.3 IU\/L in the COVID-19 patients with death while 30.1 IU\/L in the patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). Compared with the discharged alive cases, the dead cases tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time, and international standardized ratio. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, according to the main clinical outcome of COVID-19, we comprehensively described three patterns of liver impairment related to COVID-19, hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular disfunction. Patients died from COVID-19 tend to have different liver chemistries from those are discharged alive. Close monitoring of liver chemistries provides an early warning against COVID-19 related death.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qing-Qing Xing","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Dong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Dan Ren","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wei-Ming Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Dan-Yi Zeng","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Yan Cai","author_inst":"Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Zhu Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shui Pan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Edward Kogan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Chirag Barbhaiya","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Anthony Aizer","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Holmes","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Spinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry A Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080754","rel_title":"Modeling and Short-Term Forecasts of Indicators for COVID-19 Outbreak in 25 Countries at the end of March","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080754","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, causing the disease called COVID-19, spread more than 200 countries and continents end of the March.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as an important functional receptor for SARS-Cov-2. ACE2 and ACE are homologues with inverse functions in the renin-angiotensin system. ACE converts angiotensin I into a vital vasoactive peptide called angiotensin II(AngII), whereas ACE2 hydrolyzes AngII into a series of vasodilators. There were few reports illustrated the expression of AngII in COVID-19. This study aimed to demonstrate the expression of angiotensin II in COVID-19 and how it correlated to the disease. Methods: We enrolled 55 patients with COVID-19 admitted to renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 21st to February 21st, 2020. Demographic data were collected upon admission. COVID-19 nuclear acid, plasma AngII, Renin and aldosterone in the lying position without sodium restriction, and other laboratory indicators were together measured by the laboratory department of our hospital. Findings: Of the 55 patients with COVID-19, 34(61.8%) had an increased level of AngII. The severity of COVID-19 and male is positively related with the level of AngII. The level of blood lymphocyte, PCT, ALT, and AST were remarkably severe with those of normal level of AngII (P < 0.05). CD4\/CD8 cells ratio was significantly higher whereas CD3+CD8+ cells amount, CD3+CD8+ cells proportion, CD56+CD16+CD3- cells amount and CD19+CD3- cells amount were considerably lower than those of normal level of AngII (P < 0.05). Abnormal rates of blood lymphocyte and PCT were significantly higher in Patients with elevated AngII level. The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 (OR=4.123) and CD4\/CD8 ratio(OR=4.050) were the co-directional impact factor while female(OR=0.146) was inverse impact factor of elevated AngII level. Interpretation: High rate of increased level of AngII was detected in COVID-19 patients. Patients with elevated AngII level were more likely to be critically ill with COVID-19. Considering the gender differences in ACE2 expression and no gender differences in angiotensin expression, the gender differences in AngII level might indicate less loss of ACE2 in female patients. Elevated AngII level was correlated with CD4\/CD8 ratio, suggesting it might involve in immune disorder.

Our aim is to predict the impact of the compulsory containment on COVID-19 spread. Earlier knowledge of the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 transmission related to Morocco will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control the epidemic. Method: Using a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious model and the data of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd to April 9, 2020, we determined the basic and control reproduction numbers and we estimated the model parameter values. Furthermore, simulations of different scenarios of containment are performed. Results: Epidemic characteristics are predicted according to different rates of containment. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI(2.6729-3.1485). Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, is determined. Conclusion: Our findings show that the basic reproduction number reflects a high speed of spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. However, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July 4th which can be harmful and lead to consequent social-economic damages. Thus, containment need to be accompanied by other measures such as mass testing to reduce the size of asymptomatic population. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis investigation shows that the COVID-19 dynamics depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our results can help the Moroccan government to anticipate the spread of COVID-19 and avoid human loses and consequent social-economic damages as well.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aayah Hammoumi","author_inst":"Cadi Ayyad University"},{"author_name":"Redouane Qesmi","author_inst":"USMBA University"},{"author_name":"Ren-Gui Chen","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Heng-Mei Zhu","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Elena Seminari","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angela Di Matteo","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Teresa Rampino","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlomaurizio Montecucco","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Pelenghi","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Cattadori","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Francesca Pattoneri","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vitulo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Mediterraneo Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT), Palermo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bertani","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Mediterraneo Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT), Palermo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Sambataro","author_inst":"A.

Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyse the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included questions regarding fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and ageusia. A total of 2,071,349 survey responses were analysed. We defined a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Average (SA), as the mean number of symptoms reported by responders. Data were collected between March 15th to June 3rd, 2020. Notably, on the population level, following severe lockdown measures between March 15th and April 20th, SA sharply declined by 83.8% (p < 0.05), as did every single symptom, including the most common symptoms reported by our responders, cough and rhinorrhea and\\or nasal congestion, which decreased by 74.1% (p < 0.05) and 69.6% (p < 0.05), respectively. Similarly, on the individual level, analysis of repeated responses from the same individuals (N = 208,637) over time also showed a decrease in symptoms during this time period. Moreover, the reduction in symptoms was observed in all cities in Israel, and in several stratifications of demographic characteristics. Different symptoms exhibit different reduction dynamics, suggesting differences in the nature of the symptoms or in the underlying medical conditions. Between May 13th and June 3rd, following several subsequent lockdown relief measures, we observed an increase in individual symptoms and in SA, which increased by 31.42%. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel, and an increase in the prevalence of symptoms following the loosening of lockdown restrictions. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This quantification may be of major interest for COVID-19 pandemic, as many countries consider implementation of lockdown strategies.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amir Gavrieli","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Hagai Rossman","author_inst":"Weizmann institute of science"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tomer Meir","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tal Karady","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amit Lavon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Kolobkov","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Saar Shoer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080788","rel_title":"Accounting for super-spreading gives the basic reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 that is higher than initially estimated","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080788","rel_abs":"The basic reproduction number R0 of the coronavirus disease 2019 has been estimated to range between 2 and 4.

Objectives: To synthesise existing evidence about communication practices used to discuss difficult matters, including prognosis and end of life, and to use this evidence to make recommendations for clinical practice. The aim of this study was to use rapid review methods to update findings from a previous systematic review published in 2014. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA and Amed. Study eligibility criteria: Studies using conversation analysis or discourse analysis to examine recordings of actual conversations about difficult matters relating to future illness progression and end of life. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Data appraisal and extraction procedures used in the 2014 review were modified for this rapid review. Results: Following screening, 18 sources were deemed to meet eligibility criteria, which were added to the 19 sources included in the 2014 systematic review. Synthesis of study findings identified 11 communication practices: providing opportunities for patient or family members to propose matters to discuss (7 out of 37 included sources); seeking a patient or family member's perspective (6\/37); discussing the future indirectly (11\/37); discussing the future explicitly (7\/37) linking to something previously said or done (11\/37); using hypothetical scenarios (13\/37); framing a difficult matter as universal (5\/37); acknowledging uncertainty (3\/37); exploring options (2\/37); displaying sensitivity (7\/37); emphasising the positive (7\/37). Limitations: Dividing work amongst the study authors to enable rapid review may have created inconsistencies. Conclusions and implications of key findings: This synthesis of high-quality evidence from actual clinical practice supports a series of recommendations for communicating about difficult matters during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stuart Ekberg","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ruth Parry","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Land","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Katie Ekberg","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marco Pino","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Charles Antaki","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Amit Lavon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Kolobkov","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Saar Shoer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20081042","rel_title":"Fitting SIR model to COVID-19 pandemic data and comparative forecasting with machine learning","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20081042","rel_abs":"In this work, we use a classical SIR model to study COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We did a cross-sectional point prevalence survey, which was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We included a pre-determined number of centers based on each country population: five to ten EDs for countries with > 20 million inhabitants and one to five EDs for the other countries. ED directors or named delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice in use one month after the outbreak in Northern Italy. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data. Results: Overall 102 centers from 18 countries completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items. COVID-19 positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms. Conclusion: We identified variability and gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. Early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as key factors that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Bressan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Danilo Buonsenso","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Uinversitario A.

And most countries with significant outbreaks had introduced social distancing or \"lockdown\" measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how, and to what extent, these measures can be lifted. By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 29th April 2020, and covered 73 countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling. The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions - R0 0.77 (95%CI 0.68-0.87), based on cases and 0.78 (95%CI 0.68-0.88) based on mortality. Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Lonergan","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"James Chalmers","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Ruth Farrugia","author_inst":"Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta"},{"author_name":"Niccolo' Parri","author_inst":"Ospedale Pediatrico Meyer Firenze, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rianne Oostenbrink","author_inst":"Erasmus MC - Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luigi Titomanlio","author_inst":"Hospital Universitaire Robert-Debre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Damian Roland","author_inst":"Leicester Hospitals, Leister, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruud Nijman","author_inst":"St. Mary's hospital - Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"St. Mary's hospital - Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Liviana Da Dalt","author_inst":"University of Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Santiago Mintegi","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Cruces, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20080895","rel_title":"Elementary spatial structures and dispersion of COVID-19: health geography directing responses to public health emergency in Sao Paulo State, Brazil","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20080895","rel_abs":"Public health policies to contain the spread of COVID-19 rely mainly on non-pharmacological measures. Those measures, especially social distancing, are a challenge for developing countries, such as Brazil. In Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil (45 million inhabitants), most COVID-19 cases up to April 18th were reported in the Capital and metropolitan area. However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in those municipalities. In this ecological study, we use geographical models of population mobility as patterns for spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Based on surveillance data, we identify two patterns: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area and other that is hierarchical, with long-distance spread through major highways to cities of regional relevance. We also modelled the impact of social distancing strategies in the most relevant cities, and estimated a beneficial effect in each and every setting studied. This acknowledgement can provide real-time responses to support public health strategies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Magno Castelo Branco Fortaleza","author_inst":"Botucatu Medical School, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Raul Borges Guimar\u00e3es","author_inst":"Faculty of Science and Technology, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP)."},{"author_name":"Rafael de Castro Cat\u00e3o","author_inst":"Federal University of Espirito Santo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia Pio Ferreira","author_inst":"Botucatu Institute of Biosciences, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Berg de Almeida","author_inst":"Botucatu Medical School, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Brazil."},{"author_name":"Edmur Pugliesi","author_inst":"Faculty of Science and Technology, S\u00e3o Paulo State University(UNESP), Brazil"},{"author_name":"Damian Roland","author_inst":"Leicester Hospitals, Leister, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruud Nijman","author_inst":"St. Mary's hospital - Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"St. Mary's hospital - Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Liviana Da Dalt","author_inst":"University of Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Santiago Mintegi","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Cruces, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20080226","rel_title":"Review and methodological analysis of trials currently testing treatment and prevention options for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally.","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20080226","rel_abs":"Background: As novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases continue to steeply rise globally within an unprecedented short period of time, solid evidence from large randomised controlled trials is still lacking. Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and preventative options are undertaken globally. Objectives: We summarised all currently registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the retrieved interventional studies. Data sources: The ClinicalTrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched. Study eligibility criteria: Registered clinical trials examining treatment and\/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included. No language, country or study design restrictions were applied. Withdrawn, cancelled studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or preventative strategies for COVID-19 were excluded. Participants and interventions: No restrictions in terms of participants' age and medical background or type of intervention were enforced. Methods: The registries were searched using the term \"coronavirus\" or \"COVID-19\" from their inception until 26th March 2020. Additional manual search of the registries was also performed. Eligible studies were summarised and tabulated. Interventional trials were methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access studies and trials testing Traditional Chinese Medicine. Results: In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 studies assessing preventive strategies and 3 studies examining both were retrieved. Interventional treatment studies were mostly randomised (n=150, 76%) and open-label (n=73, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 (IQR 40-200). Major categories of interventions that are currently being investigated are discussed. Conclusion: Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Summarised data on these trials will assist physicians and researchers to promote patient care and guide future research efforts for COVID-19 pandemic containment. However, up to the end of March, 2020, significant information concerning reported trials was lacking.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paraskevi C.

Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual's phone establishes bluetooth contact with the phone of an infected person. We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of binary \"infected\" or \"uninfected\" statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated. In the real world, where most known-infected persons are isolated or quarantined and where many individuals may not carry their mobiles in public, we believe the improvement offered by our method warrants consideration. Importantly, in view of widespread concerns on privacy and contact-tracing, our method relies mainly on direct contact data that can be stored locally on users' phones, and uses limited communication via intermediary servers only upon testing, mitigating privacy concerns.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vishwesha Guttal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Krishna","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bengaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Rahul Siddharthan","author_inst":"The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Charalampos D.

Thermal screening, quarantining, and later lockdown were methods employed by various nations to contain the spread of the virus. Though exercising various possible plans to contain the spread help in mitigating the effect of COVID-19, projecting the rise and preparing to face the crisis would help in minimizing the effect. In the scenario, this study attempts to use Machine Learning tools to forecast the possible rise in number of cases by considering the data of daily new cases. To capture the uncertainty, three different techniques: (i) Decision Tree algorithm, (ii) Support Vector Machine algorithm, and (iii) Gaussian process regression are used to project the data and capture the possible deviation. Based on the projection of new cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, medical facilities, population density, number of test conducted, and facilities of services, are considered to define the criticality index (CI). CI is used to classify all the districts of country in the regions of high risk, low risk and moderate risk. An online dashpot is created which updates the data on daily bases for next four weeks. The prospective suggestions of this study would aid in planning the strategies to apply the lockdown\/ any other plan for any country, which can take other parameters to define the CI.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshay Kumar","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani Campus, Rajasthan, 333031, India"},{"author_name":"Farhan Mohammad Khan","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani Campus, Rajasthan, 333031, India"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani Campus, Rajasthan, 333031, India"},{"author_name":"Harish Puppala","author_inst":"BML Munjal University"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Hannah Janocha","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Universities of Giessen and Marburg Lung Centre (UGMLC), Philipps University Marburg, German Centre for Lung Research (DZL) Ma"},{"author_name":"Emmanouil Karofylakis","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"France Mentr\u00e9","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Chrysanthi Skevaki","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Universities of Giessen and Marburg Lung Centre (UGMLC), Philipps University Marburg, German Centre for Lung Research (DZL) Ma"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Laou\u00e9nan","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Carlo Pellegrini","author_inst":"IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Meloni","author_inst":"University of Pavia and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20079962","rel_title":"Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 Outbreak and Counter-Measures in France","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20079962","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic has triggered world-wide attention among data scientists and epidemiologists to analyze and predict the outcomes, by using previous statistical epidemic models.

The model presented here describes with reasonable agreement the number of COVID-19 cases registered in Brazil between February 26 and May 18, 2020 based on the hypothesis that there a large number no notified cases (11 to 1) and variation in contagion rate according to social isolation measures and greater or lesser exposure to the virus (highest rate in beginning from epidemic). To this end, we introduced an exposure factor, called {beta}1\/{beta}2, which allows us to describe the influence of factors such as social isolation on dispersal from disease. The results also corroborate a phenomenon observed in countries that registered a high growth in cases in short period of time, to example of Italy, Spain and USA: if isolation measures are imposed late, the total number of cases explodes when the epidemic is approaching from peak, which implies a higher exposure rate in the first days of case registration.From the data collected, we made the linear adjustment of the infected curve according to the time between the 41st and 74th days since the official notification of the first case and we obtained a high infection rate in the period, close to 4.0. The result indicates that the relaxation of social exclusion measures contributed to the high increase in cases in the period. This result reinforces the adoption of the model that differentiates unexposed susceptible from those that are most exposed to contagion. The model also predicts that the peak epidemic outbreak in Brazil, based on the number of cases, will occur around in late May and early June.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Augusto S.
