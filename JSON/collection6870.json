The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also very significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% CI: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95% CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like Covid-19 is very complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order to accurately assess the impact of Public Health policies on viral outbreak.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandre Hyafil","author_inst":"Centre de Recerca Matematica"},{"author_name":"David Mori\u00f1a","author_inst":"Universitat de Barcelona"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070904","rel_title":"Ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran: challenges and signs of concern","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070904","rel_abs":"Many countries with an early outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 struggled to gauge the size and start date of the epidemic mainly due to limited testing capacities and a large proportion of undetected asymptomatic and mild infections. Iran was among the first countries with a major outbreak outside China. Using all genomic sequences collected from patients with a travel link to Iran, we estimate that the epidemic started on 21\/01\/2020 (95% HPD: 05\/12\/2019-14\/02\/2020) with a doubling time of 3 days (95% HPD: 1.68-16.27). We also show, using air travel data from confirmed exported cases, that from late February to early March the number of active cases across the country were more than a hundred times higher than the reported cases at the time. A detailed province-level analysis of all-cause mortality shows 20,718 (CI 95%: 18,859-22,576) excess deaths during winter and spring 2020 compared to previous years, almost twice the number of reported COVID-19-related deaths at the time. Correcting for under-reporting of prevalence and deaths, we use an SEIR model to reconstruct the outbreak dynamics in Iran. Our model forecasted the second epidemic peak and suggests that by 14\/07\/2020 a total of 9M (CI 95%: 118K-44M) have recovered from the disease across the country. These findings have profound implications for assessing the stage of the epidemic in Iran and shed light on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in Iran and central Asia despite significant levels of under-reporting.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahan Ghafari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bardia Hejazi","author_inst":"Wesleyan University"},{"author_name":"Arman Karshenas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Stefan Dascalu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alireza Kadivar","author_inst":"Statsminutes Company"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Khosravi","author_inst":"Kawsar Human Genetic Research Center"},{"author_name":"Maryam Abbasalipour","author_inst":"Kawsar Human Genetic Research Center"},{"author_name":"Majid Heydari","author_inst":"Donya-e-Eqtesad Daily newspaper"},{"author_name":"Sirous Zeinali","author_inst":"Pasteur Institute of Iran"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alice Ledda","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aris Katzourakis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20071035","rel_title":"Outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in Europe and the effect of travel restrictions","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20071035","rel_abs":"For the first time in history, on March 17,2020, the European Union closed all its external borders to contain the spreading of the coronavirus 2019, COVID-19. Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sahli Costabal","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alireza Kadivar","author_inst":"Statsminutes Company"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Khosravi","author_inst":"Kawsar Human Genetic Research Center"},{"author_name":"Maryam Abbasalipour","author_inst":"Kawsar Human Genetic Research Center"},{"author_name":"Majid Heydari","author_inst":"Donya-e-Eqtesad Daily newspaper"},{"author_name":"Sirous Zeinali","author_inst":"Pasteur Institute of Iran"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alice Ledda","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aris Katzourakis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20070995","rel_title":"Reduced expression of COVID-19 host receptor, ACE2 is associated with small bowel inflammation, more severe disease, and response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20070995","rel_abs":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the host receptor for SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has infected millions world-wide and likely caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.

ACE2 was downregulated in CD compared to controls in independent cohorts. Within CD, ACE2 expression was reduced in inflamed ileal tissue and also remarkably, from uninvolved tissue in patients with a worse prognosis in both adult and pediatric cohorts. In active CD, small bowel ACE2 expression was restored by anti-TNF therapy particularly in anti-TNF responders. Collectively our data suggest that ACE2 downregulation is associated with inflammation and worse outcomes in CD.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alka A Potdar","author_inst":"F.

In this situation, guidelines for health care professionals in endoscopy units with increased risk of infection from inhalation of airborne droplets, conjunctival contact and faeces are urgently needed. Recently, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the German Society for Pneumology (DGP) issued recommendations. However, real-world data on the conditions and requirements of endoscopy units to adhere to this guidance are missing. Design: We conducted an internet-based survey among German endoscopy units from all levels of care from April 1st to 7th, 2020. The survey comprised 33 questions and was distributed electronically by the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) and the DGP. Results: In total, 656 endoscopy units completed the survey. Overall, 253 units (39%) cancelled fewer than 40% of their procedures. Of note, private practices cancelled less procedures than hospital-based units. Complete separation of high-risk and COVID-19 positive patients was achieved in only 20% of the units. Procedural measures were well adopted, with 91% of the units systematically identifying patients at risk and 85% using risk-adapted personal protective equipment (PPE). For the future, shortages in PPE (81%), staff (69%) and relevant financial losses (77%) were expected. Conclusion: Concise definitions of non-urgent, elective interventions and endoscopic surveillance strategies are needed to better guide endoscopic activity and intervention cancellations. In the short term, a lack of PPE can constitute considerable impairment of endoscopy units' operability and patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jakob Garbe","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stephan Eisenmann","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clara Sophie Heidemann","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marko Damm","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Krug","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steffen Walter","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm, Department for Medical Psychology, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Lammert","author_inst":"Saarland University Hospital, Department for Medicine II, Homburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kaid Darwiche","author_inst":"Ruhrland Hospital, West German Lung Center, Essen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"},{"author_name":"Patrick Michl","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jonas Rosendahl","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stephan R Targan","author_inst":"F.

Nasopharyngeal specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses collected in universal viral transport (UVT) medium were pre-processed by several commercial and laboratory-developed methods and tested by RT-qPCR assays without RNA extraction using different RT-qPCR master mixes. The results were compared to that of standard approach that involves RNA extraction. Incubation of specimens at 65{degrees}C for 10 minutes along with the use of TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix provides higher analytical sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than many other conditions tested. The optimized direct RT-qPCR approach demonstrated a limit of detection of 6.6x103 copy\/ml and high reproducibility (co-efficient of variation = 1.2%). In 132 nasopharyngeal specimens submitted for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our optimized approach were 95%, 99% and 98.5%, respectively, with reference to the standard approach. Also, the RT-qPCR CT values obtained by the two methods were positively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.6971, p=0.0013). The rate of PCR inhibition by the direct approach was 8% compared to 9% by the standard approach. Our simple approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR may help laboratories continue testing for the virus despite reagent shortages or expand their testing capacity in resource limited settings.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Rubayet Hasan","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Faheem Mirza","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hamad Al-Hail","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sathyavathi Sundararaju","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thabisile Xaba","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Iqbal","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hashim Alhussain","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hadi Mohamad Yassine","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Andres Perez Lopez","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Tang","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephan R Targan","author_inst":"F.

These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage. Design: Quality assurance. Setting: A sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center. Interventions: One to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD). Main outcome measures: Personal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies). Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3um and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory. Results: The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses. Conclusions: A typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avilash Cramer","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology"},{"author_name":"Deborah Plana","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology; Harvard Ludwig Cancer Research Center and Department of Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Helen L Yang","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mary Carmack","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science; Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enze Tian","author_inst":"Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University; Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, MIT"},{"author_name":"Michael S Sinha","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"David Krikorian","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"David Turner","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Jinhan Mo","author_inst":"Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ju Li","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, MIT"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Manning","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence T.

Post-Soviet states are facing unique challenges due to their developing healthcare systems and unstable economy. The aim of this paper was to provide estimates for current development COVID-19 pandemic in the Post-Soviet states and forecast potential best and worst scenarios for spread of this deadly infection. Methods: The data on confirmed cases and deaths were extracted from official governmental sources for a period from beginning of outbreak dates for each country until April 18, 2020. A modified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) modelling was used to plot the parameters of epidemic in 10 post-Soviet states and forecast the number of cases over a period of 10, 30 and 60 days. We also estimated the numbers of cases based on the optimal measures (best scenario) and suboptimal measures (worst scenarios) of potential spread of COVID-19 in these countries. Results: It was estimated that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached their peaks, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan are expected to reach their peaks in the coming week (April 29 - May 7, 2020), with comparatively low cases of COVID-19 and loss of lives in the best-case scenario. In contrast, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine would likely see the outbreaks with the largest number of COVID-19 cases amongst the studied Post-Soviet States in the worst scenario during the next 30 and 60 days. Geographical remoteness and small number of international travelers from the countries heavily affected by the pandemic could also have contributed to delay in the spread of COVID-19. Conclusion: Governmental response was shown to be as an important determining factor responsible for the development of COVID-19 epidemic in Post-Soviet states. The current protection rates should be maintained to reduce active cases during upcoming 30 and 60 days. The estimated possible scenarios based on the proposed model can potentially be used by healthcare professionals from each studied Post-Soviet States as well as others to improve plans to contain the current and future epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alpamys Issanov","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"Yerlan Amanbek","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"Anara Abbay","author_inst":"Nazarbayev Univesity"},{"author_name":"Shalkar Adambekov","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Aljofan","author_inst":"Nazarbayev Univesity"},{"author_name":"Ardak Kashkynbayev","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"Abduzhappar Gaipov","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"David Turner","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Jinhan Mo","author_inst":"Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ju Li","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, MIT"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Manning","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence T.

There are currently over 400 clinical trials (phase 2 and 3) of treatments for COVID-19 registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Covariate adjustment is a statistical analysis method with potential to improve precision and reduce the required sample size for a substantial number of these trials. Though covariate adjustment is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, it is underutilized, especially for the types of outcomes (binary, ordinal and time-to-event) that are common in COVID-19 trials. To demonstrate the potential value added by covariate adjustment in this context, we simulated two-arm, randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is binary, ordinal, or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital, and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preliminary description of 2449 cases. We found substantial precision gains from using covariate adjustment--equivalent to 9-21% reductions in the required sample size to achieve a desired power--for a variety of estimands (targets of inference) when the trial sample size was at least 200. We provide an R package and practical recommendations for implementing covariate adjustment.

This model can be used to make predictions of the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in different spatial scales: from a world scale to a country or even a smaller scale. Predictions on persons hospitalized, number of ventilators needed at ICUs and potential numbers of deaths were successfully carried out in different countries using this approach. This paper shows the mathematical basis for the model together with a proposal for its calibration on the different phases of the epidemic. Specific results are shown for the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain. For predicting the evolution of the epidemic four phases were considered: non-controlled evolution since the 20th of February; total lock-down from the 15th of March; partial easing of the lock-down from the 13th of April; and a phased lock-down easing from the 1st of May. In a first phase, if no control is established, the model predicted in Spain 12 millions of infected people of a total of 46.6 millions inhabitants. From those infected nearly 1 million people would need intensive care and around 700,000 deaths would be directly produced by the disease. However, as these numbers would occur in a brief period (few months), the number of deaths would have been higher due to the saturation of the health system. For a second phase, considering a total lock-down of the whole country from the 15th of March, the model predicted for the 17th of April 194,000 symptomatic infected cases, 85,700 hospitalized, nearly 8,600 patients with needs of an ICU and 19,500 deaths. The model also predicted the peak to be produced between the 29th of March and the 3rd of April. Although the data are still under revision, the accuracy in all the predictions was very good, as the reported values by that day were 197,142 infected, 7,548 inpatients needing an ICU and 20,043 deaths. The peak was produced between the 31st of May and the 2nd of April. For the third phase, the ease of the lock-down which began the 13th of April, early predictions were made by the beginning of April [Mora2020c]. Assuming conservatively an infection daily rate of a 3% (r=1.03) the model predicted 400,000 infections and 46,000+\/-15,000 deaths by the end of May. The predictions overestimated the real values, due to a stricter reduction of the infection daily rate which lead to values of r<1% and a revision of the whole series of data by the health authorities carried out along the month of May. A new prediction performed with updated parameters at the beginning of May provided a prediction of 250,000 infected and 29,000+\/-15,000 deaths. The reported values by the end of May were 282,870 infected and 28,552 deaths. After the total easing of the lock-down many uncertainties appear, but the model predicts that the health system would not saturate if the daily rate of infections r is kept below 1.02 (2% of daily increase in the number of symptomatic infected). This simple model provides a system to predict the evolution of epidemics with a good accuracy, even during epidemics development, where other systems have difficulties in their calibration. As the parameters involved in the model are based in empirical values of the different quantities (e.g. number of inpatients or deaths, related with the number of infected persons) it can be dynamically adjusted and adapted to sudden changes in the statistics. As other models, the results provided by this model can be used by the authorities to support decision making in order to optimize resources and to minimize the consequences of epidemics, including the future outbreaks of the COVID-19 which will occur.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan C.

Here, we use deep neural networks over an institution-wide platform for the augmented curation of clinical notes from 77,167 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing. By contrasting Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived symptoms of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos; n=2,317) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg; n=74,850) patients for the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia\/dysgeusia (27.1-fold), fever\/chills (2.6-fold), respiratory difficulty (2.2-fold), cough (2.2-fold), myalgia\/arthralgia (2-fold), and diarrhea (1.4-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The combination of cough and fever\/chills has 4.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia\/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19. This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional biomedical knowledge. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, thus enabling EHR-powered early disease diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"FNU Shweta","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Karthik Murugadoss","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Samir Awasthi","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Sairam Bade","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Martin Kang","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Brian W Pickering","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Philippe R Bauer","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Raymund R Razonable","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Vergidis","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Zelalem Temesgen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Stacey Rizza","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Maryam Mahmood","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Walter R Wilson","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Douglas Challener","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Praveen Anand","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Matt Liebers","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Zainab Doctor","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Eli Silvert","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Hugo Solomon","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Akash Anand","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Barve","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20062117","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics of Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients in New York City","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20062117","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Background: The coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, with over 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide. Data are needed regarding the clinical course of hospitalized patients, particularly in the United States. Methods Demographic, clinical, and outcomes data for patients admitted to five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals with confirmed Covid-19 between February 27 and April 2, 2020 were identified through institutional electronic health records. We conducted a descriptive study of patients who had in-hospital mortality or were discharged alive. Results A total of 2,199 patients with Covid-19 were hospitalized during the study period. As of April 2nd, 1,121 (51%) patients remained hospitalized, and 1,078 (49%) completed their hospital course. Of the latter, the overall mortality was 29%, and 36% required intensive care. The median age was 65 years overall and 75 years in those who died. Pre-existing conditions were present in 65% of those who died and 46% of those discharged. In those who died, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 11.7%, D-dimer was 2.4 ug\/ml, C-reactive protein was 162 mg\/L, and procalcitonin was 0.44 ng\/mL. In those discharged, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 16.6%, D-dimer was 0.93 ug\/ml, C-reactive protein was 79 mg\/L, and procalcitonin was 0.09 ng\/mL. Conclusions This is the largest and most diverse case series of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in the United States to date. Requirement of intensive care and mortality were high. Patients who died typically had pre-existing conditions and severe perturbations in inflammatory markers.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ishan Paranjpe","author_inst":"Ican School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adam Russak","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jessica K De Freitas","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Anuradha Lala","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Miotto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Akhil Vaid","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kipp W Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matteo Danieletto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eddye Golden","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dara Meyer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Manbir Singh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Somani","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sayan Manna","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Udit Nangia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arjun Kapoor","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ross O'Hagan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Paul F O'Reilly","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Laura M Huckins","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Glowe","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arash Kia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Prem Timsina","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert M Freeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Levin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Finkelstein","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith A Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Bagiella","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carol R Horowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071654","rel_title":"A study on control of novel corona-virus (2019-nCoV) disease process by using PID controller","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071654","rel_abs":"In this paper, the SEIR dynamic model will be used to model the epidemic of coronvirus (2019-nCoV)disease.

Equipment shortages and varying testing capabilities have however hindered the usefulness of the official reported positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce four complementary approaches to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, using a combination of excess influenza-like illness reports, COVID-19 test statistics, COVID-19 mortality reports, and a spatially structured epidemic model. Instead of relying on the estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our four approaches emerges the consistent conclusion that on April 4, 2020, the estimated case count was 5 to 50 times higher than the official positive test counts across the different states. Nationally, our estimates of COVID-19 symptomatic cases as of April 4 have a likely range of 2.2 to 4.9 million, with possibly as many as 8.1 million cases, up to 26 times greater than the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000. Extending our method to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 6.0 to 10.3 million, as opposed to 1.5 million positive test counts. The proposed combination of approaches may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during resurgences in the US and other countries with comparable surveillance systems.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fred S Lu","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Andre T Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County"},{"author_name":"Nicholas B Link","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Chinazzi","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Conclusions GI symptoms can be an early and not negligible feature of Covid-19, and might be correlated with a more benign disease course.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisabetta Buscarini","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Guido Manfredi","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Brambilla","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Menozzi","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Claudio Londoni","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Saverio Alicante","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Elena Iiritano","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Samanta Romeo","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Marianna Pedaci","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giampaolo Benelli","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Ciro Canetta","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lapiana","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Scartabellati","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Guido Merli","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Vigano","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Sfogliarini","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Melilli","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Assandri","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Sebastiano Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Germano Pellegata","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Finkelstein","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith A Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Bagiella","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carol R Horowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20065219","rel_title":"The association between age, COVID-19 symptoms, and social distancing behavior in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20065219","rel_abs":"Abstract Background Public health authorities recommend that people practice social distancing, especially if they have symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID 19), or are older and more at risk of serious illness if they become infected. We test the hypothesis that these groups are following these recommendations and are more likely to undertake social distancing. Methods We conducted an open online survey of 4,676 U.S. adults aged 18 and older between April 4 and April 7, 2020. We model the effects of age and common COVID-19 symptoms in the last two weeks on going out of the home for non-healthcare reasons the day before taking the survey, using a logistic model and the number of close contacts (within 6 feet) that respondents had with non-household members, using a Poisson count model. Our models control for several covariates, including other flu-like symptoms, sex, education, income, whether the respondent worked in February, household size, population density in the respondents ZIP code, state fixed effects, and the day of completion of the survey. We also weight our analyses to make the sample representative of the U.S. adult population. Findings About 52 percent of the adult United States population went out of their home the previous day. On average, adults had close contact with 1.9 non-household members. We find that having at least one COVID-19 symptom (fever, dry cough, or shortness of breath) increased the likelihood of going out the previous day and having additional close contacts with non-household members; however, the estimates were not statistically significant. When disaggregating our analysis by COVID 19 symptoms, we find no strong evidence of greater social distancing by people with a fever or cough in the last two weeks, but we do find that those who experienced shortness of breath have fewer close contacts, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.30 to 0.78). Having other flu-like symptoms reduces the odds of going out by 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.60) and the incidence rate of having close contacts by 42 percent (IRR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.88). We find that older people are just as likely to leave their homes as younger people, but people over the age of 50 had less than half the predicted number of close contacts than those who were younger than 30. Our approach has the limitation that the survey sample is self-selected. Our findings may therefore be subject to selection bias that is not adequately controlled for by weighting. In addition, the possibility exists of confounding of the results due to omitted variable bias. Conclusions We provide evidence that older people are having significantly fewer close contacts than younger people, which is in line with the public health authorities recommendations. We also find that people experiencing shortness of breath are practicing more intense social distancing. However, we find that those with two other common COVID 19 symptoms, fever and dry cough, are not engaging in greater social distancing, suggesting that increased targeting on relevant symptoms, and messaging, may be required.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Canning","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known. Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy. Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NF{kappa}B. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines. Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF- in most severe patients. These data also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jerome Hadjadj","author_inst":"Imagine institute, laboratory of Immunogenetics of Pediatric Autoimmune Diseases, INSERM UMR 1163, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Nader Yatim","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Laura Barnabei","author_inst":"Imagine institute, laboratory of Immunogenetics of Pediatric Autoimmune Diseases, INSERM UMR 1163, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Corneau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, Faculte de medecine, UMS037, PASS, Plateforme de cytometrie de la Pitie-Salpetriere CyPS, F-75013, Paris"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Boussier","author_inst":"Laboratory of Dendritic Cell Immunobiology, Department of Immunology, Institut Pasteur, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Helene Pere","author_inst":"Department of Virology, APHP-CUP, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Bruno Charbit","author_inst":"Centre for Translational Research, Institut Pasteur, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Vincent Bondet","author_inst":"Laboratory of Dendritic Cell Immunobiology, Department of Immunology, Institut Pasteur, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Camille Chenevier-Gobeaux","author_inst":"Department of Automated Diagnostic Biology, APHP.

countries and regions. By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases. Methods This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients. Results 34.3% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1*109\/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P<0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5% of the pneumonia cases. Conclusion Imported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Puyu Shi","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Guoxia Ren","author_inst":"Xi'an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Yang","author_inst":"Ankang City Central Hospital;

Materials and Method: A consecutive cohort of 73 COVID-19 and 48 influenza pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five independent institutions. The courses of both diseases were confirmed to be in the early stages (mean 2.66 (SD 2.62) days for COVID-19 and mean 2.19 (SD 2.10) days for influenza pneumonia after onset). The chi-square test, student`s t-test, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test were performed to compare CT imaging and clinical features between the two groups. Spearman or Kendall correlation tests between feature metrics and diagnosis outcomes were also assessed. The diagnostic performance of each feature in differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia was evaluated with univariate analysis. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and threshold were reported. Results: The ground-glass opacification (GGO) was the most common imaging feature in COVID-19, including pure-GGO (75.3%) and mixed-GGO (78.1%), mainly in peripheral distribution. For clinical features, most COVID-19 patients presented normal white blood cell (WBC) count (89.04%) and neutrophil count (84.93%). Twenty imaging features and 6 clinical features were identified to be significantly different between the two diseases. The diagnosis outcomes correlated significantly with the WBC count (r=-0.526, P<0.001) and neutrophil count (r=-0.500, P<0.001). Four CT imaging features had absolute correlations coefficients higher than 0.300 (P<0.001), including crazy-paving pattern, mixed-GGO in peripheral area, pleural effusions, and consolidation. Conclusions: Among a total of 1537 lesions and 62 imaging and clinical features, 26 features were demonstrated to be significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. The crazy-paving pattern was recognized as the most powerful imaging feature for the differential diagnosis in the early stage, while WBC count yielded the highest diagnostic efficacy in clinical manifestations.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiqi Yang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Meizhou People`s Hospital, Guangdong, 514031, P.

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited. Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I 2=90.9%) or the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS). Conclusions: Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.

To mine Twitter to quantitatively analyze COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by users, compare symptom distributions against clinical studies, and create a symptom lexicon for the research community. Materials and methods We retrieved tweets using COVID-19-related keywords, and performed semi-automatic filtering to curate self-reports of positive-tested users. We extracted COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned by the users, mapped them to standard concept IDs (UMLS), and compared the distributions to those reported in early studies from clinical settings. Results We identified 203 positive-tested users who reported 1002 symptoms using 668 unique expressions. The most frequently-reported symptoms were fever\/pyrexia (66.1%), cough (57.9%), body ache\/pain (42.7%), fatigue (42.1%), headache (37.4%), and dyspnea (36.3%) amongst users who reported at least 1 symptom. Mild symptoms, such as anosmia (28.7%) and ageusia (28.1%) were frequently reported on Twitter, but not in clinical studies. Conclusion The spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms identified from Twitter may complement those identified in clinical settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abeed

SARS-CoV-2 require reliable information about the spread of the infecting agent. Often real-time PCR screening of large populations is a feasible method to generate this information. Since test capacities are usually limited, pooling of test specimens is often necessary to increase screening capacity, provided that the test sensitivity is not significantly compromised. However, when a traditional pool is tested positive, all samples in the pool need individual retesting, which becomes ineffective at a higher proportion of positive samples. Here, we report a new pooling protocol that mitigates this problem by replicating samples across multiple pools. The resulting pool set allows the sample status to be resolved more often than with traditional pooling. At 2% prevalence and 20 samples per pool, our protocol increases screening capacity by factors of 5 and 2 compared to individual testing and traditional pooling, respectively. The corresponding software to layout and resolve samples is freely available under a BSD license (https:\/\/github.com\/phiweger\/clonepool).","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Viehweger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Felix K\u00fchnl","author_inst":"Interdisciplinary Center of Bioinformatics, University Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Christian Brandt","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brigitte K\u00f6nig","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Arne C.

implications of changes in blood parameters and cellular immune function in patients with 2019-coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19). Methods: Records were reviewed of 85 patients with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality at 28 days. Results: Fourteen patients died. The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO2\/FiO2, CD3+ count and CD4+ count. The percentage of neutrophil count > 6.3*109\/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count was independently associated with mortality. However, there were not significant difference in IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4 and the percentage of IgE > 100 IU\/ml between the death group and survival group. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the following at baseline could significantly predict mortality: leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts. Conclusions: For patients with COVID-19, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts that marked decrease suggest a poor outcome. A high neutrophil count is independently associated with mortality. At admission, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts should receive added attention.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yue-qiang Fu","author_inst":"Childrens

used as supportive therapy, but the treatment of COVID-19 by IVIG is controversial. This rapid review aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children with severe COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively. Results: A total of 1519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally six studies, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG. One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19 adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between low and very low. Conclusions: The existing evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy or safety of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19.

The pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing great loss. Detecting viral RNAs is standard approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with variable success. Currently, studies describing the serological diagnostic methods are emerging, while most of them just involve the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by ELISA or flow immunoassay with limited accuracy. Methods. Diagnostic approach depends on chemiluminescence immunoanalysis (CLIA) for detecting IgA, IgM and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed. The approach was tested with 216 sera from 87 COVID-19 patients and 483 sera from SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Concentration kinetics of RBD-specific serum antibodies were characterized. The relationship of serum RBD-specific antibodies and disease severity was analyzed. Results. The diagnostic accuracy based on RBD outperformed those based on NP. Adding IgA to a conventional serological test containing IgM and IgG improves sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at early stage. CLIA for detecting RBD-specific IgA, IgM and IgG showed diagnostic sensitivities of 98.6%, 96.8% and 96.8%, and specificities of 98.1%, 92.3% and 99.8%, respectively. Median concentration of IgA and IgM peaked during 16-20 days after illness onset at 8.84 g\/mL and 7.25 g\/mL, respectively, while IgG peaked during 21-25 days after illness onset at 16.47 g\/mL. Furthermore, the serum IgA level positively correlates with COVID-19 severity. Conclusion. CLIA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgM and IgG in blood provides additional values for diagnosing and monitoring of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huan

(SARS-CoV-2) has caused a rapidly unfolding pandemic, overwhelming health care systems worldwide1. Clinical manifestations of Corona-virus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death2, yet the underlying physiological conditions and mechanisms for this high variability are still unknown. Also, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance and its involvement in pathogenesis remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002\/03), however, CD4+ T cell responses are generally associated with positive outcomes3,4, while cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been investigated. Here we describe an assay that allows direct detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. We demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4+ T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy donors, albeit at lower frequencies. Strikingly, in COVID-19 patients S-reactive CD4+ T cells equally targeted both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of S whereas in healthy donors S-reactive CD4+ T cells reacted almost exclusively to the Cterminal part that is a) characterized by higher homology to spike glycoprotein of human endemic \"common cold\" coronaviruses, and b) contains the S2 subunit of S with the cytoplasmic peptide (CP), the fusion peptide (FP), and the transmembrane domain (TM) but not the receptor-binding domain (RBD). S-reactive CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients were further distinct to those from healthy donors as they co-expressed higher levels of CD38 and HLA-DR, indicating their recent in vivo activation. Our study is the first to directly measure SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses providing critical tools for large scale testing, in depth epitope mapping and characterization of potential cross-reactive cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in healthy donors is of high interest but larger scale prospective cohort studies are needed to assess whether their presence is a correlate of protection or pathology. Results of such studies will be key for a mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adaptation of containment methods and to support vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian Braun","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lucie Loyal","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Marco Frentsch","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Philipp Georg","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Manuela Dingeldey","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Beate Kruse","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florent Fauchere","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Emre Baysal","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maike Mangold","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Larissa Henze","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Roland Lauster","author_inst":"Technische Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Marcus Mall","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Beyer","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jobst Roehmel","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
