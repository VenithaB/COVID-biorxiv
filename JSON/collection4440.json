The spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan China, has been alarmingly rapid. Epi-demiologic techniques succeeded in containing the disease in China, but efforts have not been as suc-cessful in the rest of the World, with a total of 29,155,581 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 926,544 deaths worldwide as of September 15, 2020. Projections are for continued new infections and deaths if no effective therapeutic interventions can be initiated over the next several months. We per-formed a systematic review to determine the potential time course for development of treatments and vaccines, focusing on availability now and continuing in the last half of 2020. METHODS Clinical Trials: We reviewed up-to-date information from several sources to identify potential treatments for COVID-19: The Reagan-Udall Expanded Access Navigator COVID-19 Treatment Hub was used to track the efforts of companies to develop agents. We focused on trials completed as of September 1, 2020 on identified agents We used several different sources: (A) covid-trials.org, then validated results on (B) clinicaltrials.gov and the (C) World Health Organization's Inter-national Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). We excluded studies which were clearly ob-servational, with no randomization, control, or comparison group. We further set a cutoff of 100 for numbers of subjects, since smaller trial size could lack statistical power to establish superiority of the intervention over the control. Publications: We searched for published trial results on pubmed.gov and on medRxiv, the preprint serv-er, and used a targeted Google search to find announcements of unpublished trial results RESULTS Clinical Trials in Recruitment: As of our cutoff date of April 1, 2020, we found 409 trials meeting our minimum requirement of 100 subjects. The WHO Solidarity megatrial for hospitalized patients was launched in over 100 countries, actively comparing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopanovir\/ritonavir (LPV\/r) alone and in combination with interferon beta-1, and remdesivir. The LPV\/r alone and HCQ arms have already been discontinued. Of these, only 9 were conducted on outpatients. A few vaccine trials are hoping to complete Phase 3 enrollment by the end of the third quarter 2020, but a prolonged follow-up of patients will likely be required. Clinical trials Completed: As of September 1, 2020, there were 231 trials reporting completion, Of these, only 59 studies enrolled 100 or more subjects. There were 34 trials in hospitalized patients, 9 di-rected at outpatients, and 8 prevention studies, Published Data: As of September 1, 2020 we found 70 publications reporting findings in human studies on 13 classes of drugs and on 6 vaccines. There were 33 randomized placebo or active control studies; the rest were retrospective observational. Only seven publications dealt with outpatient care, the rest all in hospitalized patients. Available Treatments. At this time, remdesivir and convalescent plasma have been granted emergency use authorization in the U.S.A., solely for hospitalized patients. There is also support for glucocorticoid treatment of the COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome. No treatments or prophylaxis are offered for outpatients. CONCLUSION. COVID-19 is propagated primarily by infected ambulatory individuals. There have been no options brought forward for prevention and non-hospital treatment with only a few random-ized, controlled outpatient studies expected to yield results in time to impact on the continuing pan-demic by the end of 2020. It will be necessary for public health authorities to make hard decisions, with limited data, to prevent the continued spread of the disease. The choices will be hardest when dealing with possible early release of safe and effective vaccines which would, of course, be of greatest benefit to the World's population.

Mathematical models have played an important role in many key policy discussions about COVID-19. SIR or SIR-derived models are a common modeling technique. However, the application of these models needs to solve complicated differential equations, enabling use of these models only by professional researchers. In this study, a simple, SIR-like but individual-based model, the l-i AIR model, is presented. The parameters l and i represent the length of the latent period and the infectious period, respectively. The variable A stands for the number of the infected people in the active infectious period, I for the number of cumulative infected people, and R for the number of the people in recovery or death. The nth terms of the three variables are derived, which can be easily calculated in Microsoft Excel, making the program easy to be used in most offices. A transmission coefficient k and a transient incidence rate  of the infected people are induced in the model to examine the effect of social distancing and the testing capacity of coronavirus on the epidemic curves. The simulated daily new cases from this l-i AIR model can fit very well with the reported daily new cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China and in New York City, USA, providing important information about latent period, infectious period and lockdown efficiency, and calculating the number of actual infected people who are positive in antibodies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoping Liu","author_inst":"West Virginia University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Marik","author_inst":"Eastern Virginia School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pierre Kory","author_inst":"aurora st. luke's medical center, milwaukee, wi"},{"author_name":"Leland Shapiro","author_inst":"Rocky Mountain Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Aurora, CO and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, CO  Supported by The Emily F"},{"author_name":"Raphael Thomadsen","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jose Iglesias","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune NJ, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall"},{"author_name":"Stephen Ditmore","author_inst":"The Parkchester Times"},{"author_name":"Marc Rendell","author_inst":"The Rose Salter Medical Research Foundation, Newport Coast, CA 92657"},{"author_name":"Daniel Griffin","author_inst":"ProHEALTH, an OPTUM Company and   Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Joseph Varon","author_inst":"United Memorial Medical Center University of Texas School of Medicine Houston, Texas, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Dube","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Neha Nanda","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Gino In","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Daniel Arkfeld","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Preet Chaudhary","author_inst":"Preet.chaudhary@med.usc.edu"},{"author_name":"Vito M Campese","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Diana Hanna","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"David E Sawcer","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Glenn Ehresmann","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"David Peng","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Miroslaw Smogorewski","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"April W. armstrong","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Fred Sattler","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Rajkumar Dasgupta","author_inst":"Keck School of Medicine of USC"},{"author_name":"Cristina Mussini","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy"},{"author_name":"Oriol Mitja","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol  Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Vicente Soriano","author_inst":"UNIR Health Sciences School & Medical Center C\/ Almansa 101 Madrid 28040, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Peschanski","author_inst":"UniversityHospital of Rennes, Rennes, France"},{"author_name":"Gilles Hayem","author_inst":"Hopital Paris Saint-.

Design: prospective clinical trial (COVIDx) and observational study Setting: a large UK teaching hospital Participants: patients presenting to hospital with possible COVID-19 disease and tested on a combined nasal\/throat swab using the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 rapid POC test and in parallel a combined nasal\/throat swab for standard lab RT-PCR testing. Implementation phase participants underwent SARS-CoV-2 POC testing for a range of indications over a ten day period pre and post SAMBA II platform implementation. Main outcome measures: concordance and sensitivity and specificity of POC using the lab test as the reference standard, test turnaround time in trial and implementation periods; time to definitive patient triage from ED, time spent on COVID-19 holding wards, bay closures avoided, proportions of patients in isolation rooms following test, proportions of patients able to be moved to COVID negative areas following test. Results 149 participants were included in the COVIDx trial. 32 (21.5%) tested positive and 117 (78.5%) tested negative by standard lab RT-PCR. Median age was 62.7 (IQR 37 to 79) years and 47% were male. Cohen's kappa correlation between the index and reference tests was 0.96, 95% CI (0.91, 1.00). Sensitivity and specificity of SAMBA against the RT-PCR lab test were 96.9% (95% CI 0.838-0.999) and 99.1% (0.953-0.999) respectively. Median time to result was 2.6 hours (IQR 2.3 to 4.8) for SAMBA II and 26.4 hours (IQR 21.4 to 31.4) for the standard lab RT-PCR test (p<0.001). In the first 10 days of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test implementation for all hospital COVID-19 testing, analysis of the first 992 tests showed 59.8% of tests were used for ED patients, and the remainder were done for pre-operative screening (11.3%), discharges to nursing homes (10%), in-hospital screening of new symptoms (9.7%), screening in asymptomatic patients requiring hospital admission screening (3.8%) and access to interventions such as dialysis and chemotherapy for high risk patients (1.2%). Use of single occupancy rooms amongst those tested fell from 30.8% before to 21.2% after testing (p=0.03). 11 bay closures were avoided by use of SAMBA over ten days. The post implementation group was then compared with 599 individuals who had a standard lab RT-PCR test in the 10 days prior to SAMBA introduction. Median time to result during implementation fell from 39.4 hours (IQR 24.7-51.3) to 3.6 hours (IQR 2.6-5.8), p<0.0001 and the median time to definitive ward move from ED was significantly reduced from 24.1 hours (9.2-48.6) to 18.5 hours (10.2-28.8), p=0.002. Mean length of stay on a COVID-19 holding ward decreased from 58.5 hours to 29.9 hours (p<0.001) compared to the 10 days prior to implementation. Conclusions SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 rapid POC test performed as well as standard lab RT-PCR and demonstrated shorter time to result both in trial and real-world settings. It was also associated with faster time to triage from the ED, release of isolation rooms, avoidance of hospital bay closures and movement of patients to COVID negative open green category wards, allowed discharge to care homes and expediting access to hospital investigations and procedures. POC testing will be instrumental in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on hospital systems by allowing rapid triage and patient movement to safe and appropriate isolation wards in the hospital. This is also likely to reduce delays in patients accessing appropriate investigation and treatment, thereby improving clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dami A Collier","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Sonny M Assennato","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Nyarie Sithole","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"Katherine Sharrocks","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"Allyson Ritchie","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Pooja Ravji","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"Matt Routledge","author_inst":"cut"},{"author_name":"Dominic Sparkes","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"Jordan Skittrall","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"Ben Warne","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"Anna smielewska","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"ISOBEL RAMSEY","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NEHA GOEL","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"MARTIN CURRAN","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DAVID ENOCH","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"RHYS TASSELL","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"MICHELLE LINEHAM","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Using the European data as a basis for our analysis, we study the spreading rate of Covid-19 and model the Daily Confirmed Cases and Deaths per Million (DCCpM and DDpM) curves by using ``skew-normal'' probability density functions. The use of these asymmetrical distributions allows to get a more realistic prediction of the end of the disease in each country and to evaluate the effectiveness of the local authorities strategies in facing the European outbreak. The initial stage of the Brazilian disease is compared with the early phase of the European one. This is done by using the weekly spreading rate of Covid-19. For Sweden, UK, and USA, we shall give a forecast for the end of pandemic and for Brazil the prediction of the peak of DDpM. We also discuss additional factors that could play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, such as the fast response of the local authorities, the testing strategies, the number of beds in the intensive care units, and, last but not least, the measures of isolation adopted. The Brazilian mitigation measures can be placed between the strict lockdown of many European countries and the Swedish approach, but clearly much comparable to the European ones (in particular to the Netherlands). Methods. For Brazil, the weekly spreading rates of Covid-19, as more people are getting infected, was used to compare the outbreak in these countries with the ones of the European countries when they were at the same stage of infection. In the early stage of the disease, normal distributions have been used to obtain what we call a dynamic prediction of the peaks. After reaching the peak of daily infections and\/or deaths, skew-normal distributions are required to correctly fit the asymmetrical DCCpM and DDpM curves and get a realistic forecast of the pandemic end. Findings. The European data analysis shows that the spreading rate of Covid-19 increased similarly for all countries in its initial stage, but it changed as the number of TCCpM in each country grew. This was caused by the different timely action of the authorities in adopting isolation measures and\/or massive testing strategies. The early stage of the outbreak in the USA and Brazil shows for their $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ factor (DCCpM) a behaviour similar to Italy and Sweden, respectively. For the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ factor (DDpM), the American spreading is similar to the one of Switzerland, whereas the Brazilian factor is greater than the ones of Portugal, Germany, and Austria (which showed, in terms of TDpM, the best results in Europe) but, at the moment, it is lower than the other European countries. Interpretation. The fitting skew parameters used to model the DCCpM and DDpM curves allow a more realistic prediction of the end of the pandemic and give us the possibility to compare the mitigation measures adopted by the local authorities by analysing their respective skew normal parameters (mean, mode, standard deviation, and skewness). In Europe, Sweden and the UK show the greatest asymmetries, a kind of marathon instead of the sprint of other European countries (as observed by Swedish authorities). This also happens for the USA. The Brazilian weekly spreading rate for deaths is lower than most of the European countries at the same stage of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefano De Leo","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Esther Kohl","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Djandji","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Morgan","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Susan Whittier","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Mansukhani","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eldad Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mary D'Alton","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yousin Suh","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zev Williams","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anna smielewska","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"ISOBEL RAMSEY","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NEHA GOEL","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"MARTIN CURRAN","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DAVID ENOCH","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"RHYS TASSELL","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"MICHELLE LINEHAM","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

To provide some elements of response to these questions, we propose a simple behavior model for the government decision-making operation.

For a given tradeoff between the assumed cost functions for the economic and health impacts, it is then possible to determine the best lockdown starting date, the best lockdown duration, and the optimal severity levels during and after lockdown. The numerical analysis is based on a standard SEIR model and performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. Our analysis, based on the proposed model, shows that for France it would have been possible to have just a quarter of the actual number of people infected (over [March 1, August 31]), while simultaneously having a Gross Domestic Product loss about 30% smaller than the one expected with the current policy.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samson Lasaulce","author_inst":"CRAN, CNRS"},{"author_name":"VINEETH SATHEESKUMAR VARMA","author_inst":"CRAN, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Constantin Morarescu","author_inst":"CRAN, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Lin Siying","author_inst":"CRAN, University of Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Susan Whittier","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Mansukhani","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eldad Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mary D'Alton","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yousin Suh","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zev Williams","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anna smielewska","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"ISOBEL RAMSEY","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NEHA GOEL","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"MARTIN CURRAN","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DAVID ENOCH","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"RHYS TASSELL","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"MICHELLE LINEHAM","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

As the 10th most populated country in the world, Mexico is on a major threat by COVID-19 due to the limitations of intensive care capacities, and a total of about 1.5 hospital beds for every 1000 citizens. In this paper, we projected different scenarios to evaluate sharp or gradual quarantine lifting strategies, however, even in the hypothetical scenario that Mexico would continue with full confinement, hospitals would be reaching the maximum capacity of hospital bed occupancy. Mexican government is planning to relax the strict social distancing regulations on 1 June 2020, however, epidemic rebound risks are latent. Our results suggest that lifting social confinement needs to be gradually sparse while maintaining a decentralized region strategy among the Mexican states. To substantially lower the number of infections, predictions highlight that the elderly should remain in social confinement (approximately 11.3% of the population); the confined working class (roughly 27% of the population) must gradually return in at least four parts in consecutive months; and to the last the return of students to schools (about 21.7%). As the epidemic progresses, de-confinement strategies need to be continuously re-adjusting with the new pandemic data. Assuming the most optimistic scenario by our predictions, the smallest number of new COVID-19 cases, Mexico would require at least a 3 fold increase in hospital capacities dedicated for COVID-19. Furthermore, to observe the real dimension of the epidemic, Mexico would need to increase to at least 18 samples per 1000 people, currently is only 0.6 per 1000. All mathematical models, including ours, are only a possibility of many of the future, however, the different scenarios that were developed here highlight that a gradual decentralized region de-confinement with a significant increase in healthcare capacities is paramount to avoid a high death toll in Mexico.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristy Leonor Azanza Ricardo","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Esteban Abelardo Hernandez Vargas","author_inst":"Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies"},{"author_name":"Constantin Morarescu","author_inst":"CRAN, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Lin Siying","author_inst":"CRAN, University of Lorraine"},{"author_name":"Susan Whittier","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Mansukhani","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eldad Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mary D'Alton","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yousin Suh","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zev Williams","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anna smielewska","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"ISOBEL RAMSEY","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NEHA GOEL","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"MARTIN CURRAN","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DAVID ENOCH","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"RHYS TASSELL","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"MICHELLE LINEHAM","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

We submitted to serological screening by two different immunochromatographic (IC) rapid testing for detection of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2, 151 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare workers previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in order to evaluate the performance of rapid assays.

We identified nine variants, of which four are potentially deleterious to G6PD function, and one (rs1050828) that is known to cause G6PD deficiency. We supplemented data for the rs1050828 variant with genotype array data from over 11,000 Africans. Although this variant is common in Africans overall, large allele frequency differences exist between sub-populations. African sub-populations in the same country can show significant differences in allele frequency (e.g. 16.0% in Tsonga vs 0.8% in Xhosa, both in South Africa, {rho}=2.4x10-3).

Global collaboration offers the best chance of obtaining these data, at scale and in time. In the absence of effective therapies, insights derived from real-time observational data will be a crucial means of improving outcomes. Objective: In response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, a research and data-sharing collaborative has been assembled to harness the cumulative experience of intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. The resulting observational study provides a platform to rapidly disseminate detailed data and insights. Design: The COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium observational study is an international, multicenter, prospective, observational study of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to ICUs. Setting: This is an evolving, open-ended study that commenced on January 1st, 2020 and currently includes more than 350 sites in over 48 countries. The study enrolls patients at the time of ICU admission and follows them to the time of death, hospital discharge, or 28 days post-ICU admission, whichever occurs last. Participants: All subjects, without age limit, requiring admission to an ICU for SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\/or next-generation sequencing or with high clinical suspicion of the infection. Patients admitted to an ICU for any other reason are excluded. Main outcomes and measures: Key data, collected via an electronic case report form devised in collaboration with the ISARIC\/SPRINT-SARI networks, include: patient demographic data and risk factors, clinical features, severity of illness and respiratory failure, need for non-invasive and\/or mechanical ventilation and\/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and associated complications, as well as data on adjunctive therapies. Final outcomes of in-hospital death, discharge or continuing admissions at 28 days. Discussion: This large-scale, observational study of COVID-19 in the critically ill will provide rapid international characterization. Open-ended accrual will increase the power to answer hypothesis-led questions over time. Several sub-studies have already been initiated, examining hemostasis, neurological, cardiac, and long-term outcomes.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianluigi Li Bassi","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jacky Suen","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Adrian G Barnett","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Amanda Corley","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E.

It is given as part of best endeavours treatment in the absence of sufficient evidence to guide best practice. The use of CPAP as a step up in clinical care is now common but has a poor evidence base. Using routinely collected data, the use of CPAP as a supportive non-invasive ventilatory treatment is described in 35 patients with COVID infection. Patients given early CPAP and in particular within 48 hours of admission, are shown to have a better outcome (a significant probability of lower mortality) than patients who received late CPAP (more than 48 hours after admission). Although the analysis is affected by a small sample size, the results have shown good evidence that supports the early use of CPAP in patients with COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdul Ashish","author_inst":"Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alison Unsworth","author_inst":"Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jane Martindale","author_inst":"Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ramachandran Sundar","author_inst":"Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Luigi Sedda","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Martin Farrier","author_inst":"Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"India Lye","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Colombo","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Karin Wildi","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Samantha Livingstone","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Abbate","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Samuel Hinton","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Benoit Liquet","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sally Shrapnel","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Heidi J Dalton","author_inst":"INOVA Fairfax Medical Center, Heart and Vascular Institute, Falls Church VA, USA"},{"author_name":"John F Fraser","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"MICHELLE LINEHAM","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Methods We undertook a prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 in a single ED in England. We used univariate and multiple logistic regression to examine whether the presence and severity of T1RF in the ED was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Results 180 patients with suspected COVID19 infection met the inclusion criteria for this study, of which 39 (22%) died. Severity of T1RF was associated with increased mortality with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.58 (0.49 to 5.14), 3.60 (1.23 to 10.6) and 18.5 (5.65 to 60.8) for mild, moderate and severe T1RF, respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, neutrophil-lymphocyte ration (NLR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the association remained, with ORs of 0.63 (0.13 to 3.03), 3.95 (0.94 to 16.6) and 45.8 (7.25 to 290). The results were consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Severity of T1RF in the ED is an important prognostic factor of mortality in patients admitted with suspected COVID19 infection. Current prediction models frequently do not include this factor and should be applied with caution. Further large scale research on predictors of mortality in COVID19 infection should include SpO2\/eFiO2 ratios or a similar measure of respiratory dysfunction.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johannes von Vopelius-Feldt","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watson","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Carla Swanson-Low","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"James Cameron","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Luigi Sedda","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Martin Farrier","author_inst":"Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"India Lye","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Colombo","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Karin Wildi","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Samantha Livingstone","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Abbate","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Samuel Hinton","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Benoit Liquet","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sally Shrapnel","author_inst":"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Heidi J Dalton","author_inst":"INOVA Fairfax Medical Center, Heart and Vascular Institute, Falls Church VA, USA"},{"author_name":"John F Fraser","author_inst":"Critical Care Research Group, The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"MICHELLE LINEHAM","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Methods and Findings -- The design was a matched case-control study. Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 in the national database followed by entry to a critical care unit or death within 28 days, or a death certificate with COVID-19 as underlying cause. Up to ten controls per case matched for sex, age and primary care practice were selected from the population register. All diagnostic codes from the past five years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past nine months were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. There were 4272 severe cases. In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios for severe disease were 2.87 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.63 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio (95% CI) 21.4 (19.1, 23.9). Univariate rate ratios (95% CIs) for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 2.75 (1.96, 3.88) for Type 1 diabetes, 1.60 (1.48, 1.74) for Type 2 diabetes, 1.49 (1.37, 1.61) for ischemic heart disease, 2.23 (2.08, 2.39) for other heart disease, 1.96 (1.83, 2.10) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 4.06 (3.15, 5.23) for chronic kidney disease, 5.4 (4.9, 5.8) for neurological disease, 3.61 (2.60, 5.00) for chronic liver disease and 2.66 (1.86, 3.79) for immune deficiency or suppression. 78% of cases and 52% of controls had at least one listed condition (NA of cases and NA of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past nine months and with at least one hospital admission in the past five years [rate ratios 3.10 (2.59, 3.71)] and 2.75 (2.53, 2.99) respectively] even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 2.58 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses and prescriptions provided an additional 1.25 bits (C-statistic 0.825). A limitation of this study is that records from primary care were not available. Conclusions -- Along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul M McKeigue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Amanda Weir","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jen Bishop","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Stuart McGurnaghan","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sharon Kennedy","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"David McAllister","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Methods: We conducted immunologic testing of healthcare workers to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in this population. HCW were advised to wait at least two weeks from time of symptom onset or suspected exposure before undergoing testing. All participants were self-reported asymptomatic for at least three days at the time of testing. Results: Two hundred eighty-five samples were collected from March 24, 2020 to April 4, 2020. The average age of participants was 38 years (range 18-84), and 54% were male. Thirty-three percept tested IgG positive, 3% tested weakly positive, and 64% tested negative. Neither age nor sex was associated with antibody development. Conclusion: Thirty-six percent of HCW had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, reflecting the high exposure of inpatient and ambulatory frontline staff to this viral illness, most of whom had minimal symptoms and were working in the weeks preceding testing. While we continue to recommend standard protective precautions per CDC guidelines for all HCW, HCW with SARS-CoV-2 IgG may become our safest frontline providers as we learn if our IgG antibodies confer immunity. Knowing IgG antibody status may ease concerns regarding personal risk as this pandemic continues.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayce Mansour","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emily Levin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Muellers","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Stone","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ania Wajnberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Indonesia officially established the first COVID-19 confirmation case in early March 2020. East Kalimantan has been determined as a candidate for the new capital of Indonesia since 2019. This makes Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital Samarinda as the largest hospital there has been designated as the main referral hospital for COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan. We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of these patients. Methods All patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR were admitted to Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital in Samarinda. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data on patients with standardized data collection from medical records. Results By May 8, 2020, 18 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Most of the infected patients were men (16 [88.9%] patients); less than half had underlying diseases (7 [38.9%] patients). Common symptoms at the onset of illness were cough (16 [88.9%] patients), sore throat (8 [44.4%] patients), and fever (8 [44.4%] patients). Laboratory findings of some patients on admission showed anemia. Levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were increased in 10 (55.6%) of 18 patients. On admission, abnormalities in chest x-ray images were detected in 6 (33.3%) patients who had pneumonia. The mean duration from the first hospital admission to discharge was 33.1 days. Discussion The majority of COVID-19 patients are male. COVID-19 comorbidities were found in several patients. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in this study were cough, sore throat, and fever. The abnormal laboratory finding in COVID-19 patients is anemia, an increase in AST and ALT levels, and chest x-ray images of pneumonia. All patients are in mild condition. The average length of hospital admission patients to discharge is more than 30 days. Conclusion Although all patients are in mild condition, the inability of a local laboratory to check for positive confirmation of COVID-19 makes the admission period of the patient in the hospital very long. The availability of RT-PCR tests at Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital Samarinda will greatly assist the further management of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swandari Paramita","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Ronny Isnuwardana","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Marwan Marwan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Donny Irfandi Alfian","author_inst":"Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"David Hariadi Masjhoer","author_inst":"Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital, Samarinda, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Ania Wajnberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

INSIGHT combines the advantages of near-patient with centralised testing. Stage 1 allows a quick decentralised readout for early isolation of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. The same reaction products can then be used in a highly multiplexed sequencing-based assay in Stage 2, confirming the near-patient testing results and facilitating centralised data collection. Based on experiments using commercially acquired human saliva with spiked-in viral RNA as input, the INSIGHT platform gives Stage 1 results within one to two hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow (dipstick) readout, whilst simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes into the amplification product. INSIGHT Stage 2 can be performed by directly pooling and sequencing all post-amplification barcoded Stage 1 products from hundreds of thousands of samples with minimal sample preparation steps. The 95% limit of detection (LoD-95) for INSIGHT is estimated to be below 50 copies of viral RNA per 20 l of reaction. Our two-stage testing strategy is suitable for further development into a rapid home-based and point-of-care assay, and is potentially scalable to the population level.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qianxin Wu","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK."},{"author_name":"Chenqu Suo","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK; Department of Paediatrics, Cambridge University Hospitals, Hills Road, Cambr"},{"author_name":"Tom Brown","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory, 12 Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3TA, UK."},{"author_name":"Tengyao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Statistical Science, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London WC1E 7HB, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah A Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK; Department of Physics\/Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thom"},{"author_name":"Andrew R Bassett","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA, UK."},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Due to these limiting factors, only patients showing symptoms indicating infection were subjected to testing, whilst asymptomatic individuals, who are widely believed to be responsible for the fast dispersion of the virus, were largely omitted from the testing regimes. The inability to implement high throughput diagnostic and contact tracing strategies has forced many countries to institute lockdowns with severe economic and social consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged affected countries to increase testing capabilities to identify new cases, allow for a well-controlled lifting of lockdown measures, and prepare for future outbreaks. Here, we propose HiDRA-seq, a rapidly implementable, high throughput, and scalable solution that uses NGS lab infrastructure and reagents for population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing. This method is based on the use of indexed oligo-dT primers to generate barcoded cDNA from a large number of patient samples. From this, highly multiplexed NGS libraries are prepared targeting SARS-CoV-2 specific regions and sequenced. The low amount of sequencing data required for diagnosis allows the combination of thousands of samples in a sequencing run, while reducing the cost to approximately 2 CHF\/EUR\/USD per RNA sample. Here, we describe in detail the first version of the protocol, which can be further improved in the future to increase its sensitivity and to identify other respiratory viruses or analyze individual genetic features associated with disease progression.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emilio Yanguez","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Griffin White","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Susanne Kreutzer","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Lennart Opitz","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Lucy Poveda","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Timothy Sykes","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Maria Domenica Moccia","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Catharine Aquino","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Ralph Schlapbach","author_inst":"Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH\/UZH)"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"DEVAN VAGHELA","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLARE LEONG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HOI PING MOK","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"JOHN BRADLEY","author_inst":"CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"},{"author_name":"KENNETH GC SMITH","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"NIKOS DEMIRIS","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Importantly, H014 administration reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers in the infected lungs and prevented pulmonary pathology in hACE2 mouse model. Cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with the H014 Fab fragment unveiled a novel conformational epitope, which is only accessible when the RBD is in open conformation. Biochemical, cellular, virological and structural studies demonstrated that H014 prevents attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to its host cell receptors. Epitope analysis of available neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 uncover broad cross-protective epitopes. Our results highlight a key role for antibody-based therapeutic interventions in the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nOne sentence summaryA potent neutralizing antibody conferred protection against

The virus enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. The nanobody binds with high affinity in the low nM range to the RBD, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 conformations and that Ty1 sterically hinders RBD-ACE2 binding. This 12.8 kDa nanobody does not need an Fc domain to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Maria Laura Perez Vidakovics","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sheward","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Hrishikesh Das","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tim Schulte","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ainhoa Moliner Morro","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Martin Corcoran","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Adnane Achour","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"B.

The severity of Covid-19, the exponential rate at which the virus proliferates, and the rapid exhaustion of the public health resources are critical factors. The RT-PCR with virus DNA identification is still the benchmark Covid-19 diagnosis method. In this work we propose a new technique for representing DNA sequences: they are divided into smaller sequences with overlap in a pseudo-convolutional approach, and represented by co-occurrence matrices. This technique analyzes the DNA sequences obtained by the RT-PCR method, eliminating sequence alignment. Through the proposed method, it is possible to identify virus sequences from a large database: 347,363 virus DNA sequences from 24 virus families and SARS-Cov-2. Experiments with all 24 virus families and SARS-Cov-2 (multi-class scenario) resulted 0.822222 {+\/-} 0.05613 for sensitivity and 0.99974 {+\/-} 0.00001 for specificity using Random Forests with 100 trees and 30% overlap. When we compared SARS-Cov-2 with similar-symptoms virus families, we got 0.97059 {+\/-} 0.03387 for sensitivity, and 0.99187 {+\/-} 0.00046 for specificity with MLP classifier and 30% overlap. In the real test scenario, in which SARS-Cov-2 is compared to Coronaviridae and healthy human DNA sequences, we got 0.98824 {+\/-} 001198 for sensitivity and 0.99860 {+\/-} 0.00020 for specificity with MLP and 50% overlap. Therefore, the molecular diagnosis of Covid-19 can be optimized by combining RT-PCR and our pseudo-convolutional method to identify SARS-Cov-2 DNA sequences faster with higher specificity and sensitivity.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Leandro Honorato de S.

Our group was interested in the feasibility of ozone disinfection of N95 respirators as an alternative for healthcare professionals and organizations that might not have access to other disinfection devices. We tested the effectiveness of ozone on killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) on three different N95 respirators: 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8000. We used an ozone chamber that consisted of: an airtight chamber, an ozone generator, an ozone destruct unit, and an ozone UV analyzer. The chamber was capable of concentrating ozone up to 500 parts per million (ppm) from ambient air, creating an airtight seal, and precisely measuring ozone levels within the chamber. Exposure to ozone at 400 ppm with 80% humidity for two hours effectively killed bacteria on N95 respirators, types 1860, 1870, and 8000. There were no significant changes in filtration efficiency of the 1860 and 1870 type respirators for up to ten cycles of ozone exposure at similar conditions. There was no change in fit observed in the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. There was no significant change in the strap integrity of the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. Tests for filtration efficiency were not performed on the 8000 type respirator. Tests for fit or strap integrity were not performed on the 8000 or 1860 type respirators. This study demonstrates that an ozone application achieves a high level of disinfection against PsA, a vegetative bacteria that the CDC identifies as more difficult to kill than medium sized viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). Furthermore, conditions shown to kill these bacteria did not damage or degrade respirator filtration. This is the first report of successful disinfection of N95 PPE with ozone of which the authors are aware. It is also the first report, to the authors' knowledge, to identify necessary conditions for ozone to kill organisms on N95 masks without degrading the function of N95 filters.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward P Manning","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Stephens","author_inst":"Air Liquide Advanced Materials, Branchburg, NJ"},{"author_name":"Sannel Patel","author_inst":"Ozone Solutions, Hull, IA"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Dufresne","author_inst":"IM3 Consulting Group, Quebec City, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bruce Silver","author_inst":"Silver Dental Associates, LLC, Burlington, NJ"},{"author_name":"Patricia Gerbarg","author_inst":"Department of Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valahalla, NY"},{"author_name":"Zach Gerbarg","author_inst":"Gerbarg & Associates, Inc, Scottsdale, AZ"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT"},{"author_name":"Lokesh Sharma","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT"},{"author_name":"B.

Professional societies have recommended changes in cancer service provision to minimize COVID-19 risks to cancer patients and health care workers. However, we do not know the extent to which cancer patients, in whom multi-morbidity is common, may be at higher overall risk of mortality as a net result of multiple factors including COVID-19 infection, changes in health services, and socioeconomic factors. Methods: We report multi-center, weekly cancer diagnostic referrals and chemotherapy treatments until April 2020 in England and Northern Ireland. We analyzed population-based health records from 3,862,012 adults in England to estimate 1-year mortality in 24 cancer sites and 15 non-cancer comorbidity clusters (40 conditions) recognized by CDC as high-risk. We estimated overall (direct and indirect) effects of COVID-19 emergency on mortality under different Relative Impact of the Emergency (RIE) and different Proportions of the population Affected by the Emergency (PAE). We applied the same model to the US, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data. Results: Weekly data until April 2020 demonstrate significant falls in admissions for chemotherapy (45-66% reduction) and urgent referrals for early cancer diagnosis (70-89% reduction), compared to pre-emergency levels. Under conservative assumptions of the emergency affecting only people with newly diagnosed cancer (incident cases) at COVID-19 PAE of 40%, and an RIE of 1.5, the model estimated 6,270 excess deaths at 1 year in England and 33,890 excess deaths in the US. In England, the proportion of patients with incident cancer with [&ge;]1 comorbidity was 65.2%. The number of comorbidities was strongly associated with cancer mortality risk. Across a range of model assumptions, and across incident and prevalent cancer cases, 78% of excess deaths occur in cancer patients with [&ge;]1 comorbidity. Conclusion: We provide the first estimates of potential excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity due to the COVID-19 emergency and demonstrate dramatic changes in cancer services. To better inform prioritization of cancer care and guide policy change, there is an urgent need for weekly data on cause-specific excess mortality, cancer diagnosis and treatment provision and better intelligence on the use of effective treatments for comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvina G Lai","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michail Katsoulis","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wai Hoong Chang","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Bryan Williams","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"David Linch","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is likely that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to naive cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to subclinical infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats develop a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented re-infection to a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection, but do mount an anti-viral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human exposure; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets during acute infection. Resistance to re-exposure holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats, and by extension humans, to disease susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angela Bosco-Lauth","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Airn E.

This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2. We describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level similarities to specialize a Bayesian mechanistic model based on observed fatalities. Using this approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, R_t, due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties. We estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread. Our results suggest that local conditions are pertinent to containment and re-opening decisions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Ying Wu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Killeen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Philipp Nikutta","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Mareike Thies","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Anna Zapaishchykova","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Shreya Chakraborty","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Mathias Unberath","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Izabela Ragan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Maison","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Bowen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government. Methods We use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified as household, school, work and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, to estimate the number of new infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages. Findings We found that with increased levels of testing of people (between 25% and 72% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and effective contact-tracing and isolation for infected individuals, an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios, with the effective reproduction number (R) remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase. If UK schools reopen in phases from June 2020, prevention of a second wave would require testing 51% of symptomatic infections, tracing of 40% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave, as are other scenarios for reopening. When infectiousness of <20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, our findings remained unchanged. Interpretation To prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be implemented alongside an active large-scale population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals. Such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing a large number of COVID-19 deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Cliff Kerr","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Robyn Margaret Stuart","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Daniel Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Russell M Viner","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond St. Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Chris Bonell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Izabela Ragan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Maison","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Bowen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.

Active surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can aid in early detection of outbreaks, but the testing frequency required to identify an outbreak at its earliest stage is unknown. We assess what testing frequency is required to detect an outbreak before there are 10 detectable infections. Methods: A dynamic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 was developed to simulate spread among a university community. After introducing a single infection into a fully susceptible population, we calculate the probability of detecting at least one case on each succeeding day with various NAT testing frequencies (daily testing achieving 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the population tested per month) assuming an 85% test sensitivity. A proportion of infected individuals (varied from 1-60%) are assumed to present to health services (HS) for symptomatic testing. We ascertain the expected number of detectable infections in the community when there is a >90% probability of detecting at least 1 case. Sensitivity analyses examine impact of transmission rates (Rt=0=2, 2.5,3), presentation to HS (1%\/5%\/30%\/60%), and pre-existing immunity (0%\/10%) Results: Assuming an 85% test sensitivity, identifying an outbreak with 90% probability when the expected number of detectable infections is 9 or fewer requires NAT testing of 100% of the population per month; this result holds for all transmission rates and all levels of presentation at health services we considered. . If 1% of infected people present at HS and Rt=0=3, testing 75%\/50%\/25% per month could identify an outbreak when the expected numbers of detectable infections are 12\/17\/30 respectively; these numbers decline to 9\/11\/12 if 30% of infected people present at HS . As proportion of infected individuals present at health services increases, the marginal impact of active surveillance is reduced. Higher transmission rates result in shorter time to detection but also rapidly escalating cases without intervention. Little differences were observed with 10% pre-existing immunity. Conclusions: Widespread testing of 100% of the campus population every month is required to detect an outbreak when there are fewer than 9 detectable infections for the scenarios examined, but high presentation of symptomatic people at HS can compensate in part for lower levels of testing. Early detection is necessary, but not sufficient, to curtail disease outbreaks; the proposed testing rates would need to be accompanied by case isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and other risk mitigation and social distancing interventions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natasha Martin","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Robert T Schooley","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Victor De Gruttola","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Daniel Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modelling"},{"author_name":"Russell M Viner","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond St. Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Chris Bonell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Izabela Ragan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Maison","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Bowen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Derralynn Hughes","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Martin D Forster","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Clare Turnbull","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Natalie K Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Boyd","author_inst":"Northern Ireland Cancer Network"},{"author_name":"Graham R Foster","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Matt Cooper","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Monica Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Kathy Pritchard-Jones","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Geoff Hall","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Charlie Davie","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"DATA-CAN, Health Data Research UK hub for cancer hosted by UCLPartners"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"MARTIN BESSER","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"GORDON DOUGAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"PAUL J LEHNER","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE"},{"author_name":"Mark Siedner","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"HONGYI ZHANG","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE WADDINGTON","author_inst":"CUH"},{"author_name":"HELEN LEE","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,  Ave 31 e\/ 158 and 190.
