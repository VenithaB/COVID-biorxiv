Methods: 82 studies were included in the present meta-analysis that all of them have been published before May 1, 2020 and were found by searching through the databases Scopus and MEDLINE. The selected papers were studied and analyzed by employing the version 14 of stata software. It should be noted that, we employed I2 statistics for testing and verifying heterogeneity. Results: 82 papers were finally chosen for this meta- analysis, including 74855 infected patients (35673 men, 31140 women). The mean age of the patients was 56.49. The results indicate the prevalence of fever 79.84 (95% CI: 75.22-84.13), cough 59.53 (95% CI: 55.35-63.65), fatigue or myalgia 33.46 (95% CI: 28.68-38.40), dyspnea 31.48 (95% CI: 25.75-37.49) and diarrhea 10.71 (95% CI: 8.20-13.49). The prevalence of the most common comorbidities were hypertension 25.10 (95% CI: 19.91-30.64), diabetes 13.48 (95% CI: 10.61-16.62), cardiovascular diseases 8.94 (95% CI: 6.99-11.10), and chronic kidney disease 3.27 (95% CI: 2.22-4.47). Conclusion: The results of this study are seriously needed to effectively monitor the health of people with comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and chronic kidney disease) to prevent the development of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mobina Fathi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kimia Vakili","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Sayehmiri","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Mohamadkhani","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammadreza Hajiesmaeili","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mostafa Rezaei-Tavirani","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Owrang Eilami","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.148577","rel_title":"Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 infection with chronic obesity inflammation: a complex network phenomenon","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.148577","rel_abs":"Obesity is one of the biggest public health problems in the world, and its pathophysiological characteristics include chronic inflammation with an increase in various circulating inflammatory markers, such as acute inflammatory cytokines. Complications in the respiratory tract are related to bodily problems, which lead to a restriction of lung function due to reduced volume, inducing an increase in respiratory work. SARS-CoV-2 has a high potential for contamination by respiratory secretions and, therefore, obesity is one of the main risk factors for complications due to the association established between obesity, chronic inflammation and respiratory infection. The objective was to analyze the complex relationships between obesity and COVID-19 in a meta-analysis study using complex network modeling and the theoretical knockouts technique. Here, we identify and justify through a mathematical analysis the relationships between all the immunological agents added to the proposed immunological networks, considered as a simple evident interaction, relationship, influence, response, activation, based on our quantifiers. They performed the knockouts of all 52 vertices in the COVID-19 network and obesity - regardless of the environment, which would result in nonsense - and the COVID-19 infection network without considering obesity. The stationary flow vector (flow profile), for some knockouts of immunological interest in COVID-19 infections, was chosen IFN, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF. This initial study pointed out the importance of chronic inflammation in the obese individual as an important factor in potentiating the disease caused by covid-19 and, in particular, the importance on IL-17.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovani  Marino Favero","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa"},{"author_name":"Luis  Paulo Gomes Mascarenhas","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual do Centro Oeste"},{"author_name":"Meirielly Furmann","author_inst":"Universidade do Centro Oeste"},{"author_name":"Juliana Berton","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa"},{"author_name":"Pedro  Jeferson Miranda","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa"},{"author_name":"Mostafa Rezaei-Tavirani","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Owrang Eilami","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127175","rel_title":"Excess deaths in people with cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127175","rel_abs":"Background: Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) increase mortality risk from coronavirus infection(COVID-19), but there are concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both direct, through infection, and indirect, through changes in healthcare. Methods: We used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in England to estimate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality risk(direct effect) for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). For indirect effects, we analysed weekly mortality and emergency department data for England\/Wales and monthly hospital data from England(n=2), China(n=5) and Italy(n=1) for CVD referral, diagnosis and treatment until 1 May 2020. Findings: CVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy and England during the pandemic. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still reduced in Italy and England. Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous(peak RR 1.4). For total CVD(incident and prevalent), at 10% population COVID-19 rate, we estimated direct impact of 31,205 and 62,410 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess deaths. Interpretation: Supply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Suliang Chen","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Alvina Lai","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michail Katsoulis","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vahe Nafilyan","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Bryan Williams","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Nilesh Pareek","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bromage","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

During the early phase, little was known about public awareness relating to Coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among the Iranian public towards COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from 2 March to 8 April 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific to infectious diseases. Results: All participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty breathing and cough as signs\/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that by staying at home and staying isolated (95.3%, 95 % CI: 94.2-96.3) as well as constant hand washing and using disinfectants (92.5%, 95 % CI: 91.1-93.8) could prevent COVID-19. However, there was also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%, 95 % CI: 55.5-60.5) and by air (48.3%, 95 % CI: 45.7-50.8). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included hand washing with soap and water (95.4%, 95 % CI: 94.3-96.4), avoiding crowded places (93%, 95 % CI: 91.7-94.3), cleaning hands with other disinfectants (80.9 %, 95 % CI: 78.9- 82.9), and covering mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing (76.1 %, 95 % CI: 73.9-78.2). The internet and social media (94.5%, 95 % CI: 93.3-95.6) were the main Coronavirus information sources. However, the most trusted information sources on Coronavirus were health and medical professionals (79.3%, 95 % CI: 77.2-81.3). The majority of participants (77.0%, 95 % CI: 74.8-79.1) wanted more information about Coronavirus to be available. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that people's knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak was of a high level. Therefore, health systems should use multiple ways, such as mass media, phone applications, electronic, print, and tele-education to increase KAP related to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edris Kakemam","author_inst":"Tabriz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"DJavad Ghoddoosi-Nejad","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zahra Chegini","author_inst":"Qazvin University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Khalil Momeni","author_inst":"Ilam University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hamid Salehinia","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Hassanipour","author_inst":"Guilan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hosein Ameri","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Morteza Arab-Zozani","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Nilesh Pareek","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bromage","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

Design: Observational cohort study conducted between April 17 and May 1, 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. Setting: Medical and main campuses of a university. Participants: All faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows. Exposures: Work factors including supervisor support and exposure to high-risk clinical settings; personal factors including demographics and family\/home stressors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. Results: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 - 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family\/home stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Conclusions and Implications: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees. Prevention of exposure to COVID-19 and increased supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bradley A Evanoff","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jaime R Strickland","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ann Marie Dale","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hayibor","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Page","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jennifer G Duncan","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kannampallil","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diana L Gray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Nilesh Pareek","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bromage","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

The epidemiological data indicate that infection and mortality rates are greater in European populations in comparison with eastern Asians. To test if epidemiological patterns may be partly determined by human genetic variation, we investigated, by exomic and databank analyses, the variability found in the TMPRSS2 gene in populations from different continents, since this gene is fundamental to virus access into human cells. The functional variants revealed low diversity. The analyses of the variation in the modifiers of gene expression indicate that the European populations may have much higher levels of pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 gene and would be more vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 may be reduced in the populations from East Asia, which implies that they are less susceptible to the virus infection and, these genetic features might also favor their better outcomes. The presented data, if confirmed, indicates a potential genetic contribution of TMPRSS2 to individual susceptibility to viral infection, and might also influence COVID-19 outcome.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ney Pereira Carneiro Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andre Salim Khayat","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carla Gomes Rodrigues","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Pablo Carmo Pinto","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Gilderlanio Santana Araujo","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Lucas Favacho Pastana","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Jessyca Amanda Gomes Medeiros","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Marianne Rodrigues Fernandes","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Arthur Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Bruna Claudia Meireles Khayat","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Fabiano Cordeiro Moreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andre Mauricio Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Paula Barauna Assumpcao","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Paulo Pimentel Assumpcao","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Sidney Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

Based on a newly developed mathematical model, we estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Latin American countries. The results show that the virus spreads unevenly across countries. For example, Ecuador and Brazil are the most affected countries, with approximately 3% of the infected population. Currently, the number of new infections is increasing in all countries examined, with the exception of some Caribbean countries as Cuba.

Patients with multiple myeloma have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management. Objective: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma. Design: Case-series. Setting: Five large academic centers in New York City. Participants: Patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. Exposures: Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Of 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58%; median age 68, range 41-91) diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74%) were admitted; of these 13 (18%) patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24%) expired. None of the studied risk factors were significantly associated (P>0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.3-3.2); age >65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8-5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant <12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.2-7.4), IgG<650 mg\/dL (N=42) OR=1.2 (95% CI 0.4-3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-8.1). Conclusions and Relevance: Although multiple myeloma patients have a compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19, compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality rates.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malin Hultcrantz","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua Richter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Cara Rosenbaum","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dhwani Patel","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Smith","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Neha Korde","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sydney Lu","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Urvi Shah","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander Lesokhin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hani Hassoun","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Carlyn Tan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Francesco Maura","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Andriy Derkach","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Diamond","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Adriana Rossi","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roger N Pearse","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Deppu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Kaminetzky","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Marc Braunstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Christian Gordillo","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Faith Davies","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ruben Niesvizky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Lentzsch","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gareth Morgan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126417","rel_title":"Identification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Japan by multiple molecular assays-implication for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126417","rel_abs":"Presence of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater sample has been documented in several countries. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is potentially effective for early warning of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to verify the detection limit of WBE for COVID-19. In total, 27 influent wastewater samples were collected from four wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, numbers of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from almost 0 to around 20 per 100,000 peoples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the samples were identified by several PCR-based assays. Among the 27 samples, 7 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by at least one out of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. These samples were also positive by RT-nested PCR assays. The detection frequency became higher when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 peoples became above 10 in each prefecture. However, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected with a low frequency when the number was below 1.0. Considering that the number of the confirmed cases does not necessarily reflect the actual prevalence of the infection at the time point, data on the relationship between the number of infection cases and concentration in wastewater needs to be accumulated further.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akihiko Hata","author_inst":"Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University"},{"author_name":"Ryo Honda","author_inst":"Faculty of Geosciences and Civil Engineering, Kanazawa University"},{"author_name":"Hiroe Hara-Yamamura","author_inst":"Faculty of Geosciences and Civil Engineering, Kanazawa University"},{"author_name":"Yuno Meuchi","author_inst":"Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University"},{"author_name":"Eric Smith","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Neha Korde","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sydney Lu","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Urvi Shah","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander Lesokhin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hani Hassoun","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Carlyn Tan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Francesco Maura","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Andriy Derkach","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Diamond","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Adriana Rossi","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roger N Pearse","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Deppu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Kaminetzky","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Marc Braunstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Christian Gordillo","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Faith Davies","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ruben Niesvizky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Lentzsch","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gareth Morgan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126581","rel_title":"Assessment of Experiences of Preventive Measures Practice including Vaccination History and Health Education among Umrah Pilgrims in Saudi Arabia, 1440H-2019","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126581","rel_abs":"Background Annually, approximately 10 million Umrah pilgrims travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Umrah from more than 180 countries. This event presents major challenges for the Kingdom public health sector, which strives to decrease the burden of infectious diseases and to adequately control its spread. Aims of the study The aims of the study were to assess the experiences of preventive measures practice, including vaccination history and health education, among Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross sectional survey administered to a randomly selected group of pilgrims by the research team members from February to the end of April 2019 at the departure lounge at King Abdul Aziz International airport, Jeddah city. The questionnaire was comprised of questions on the following factors: sociodemographic information, level of education, history of vaccinations and chronic illnesses, whether the pilgrim has received any health education and orientation prior to coming Saudi Arabia or on their arrival, and their experiences with preventive medicine. Results Pilgrims (n=1012) of 48 nationalities completed the survey and were reported in this study. Chronic diseases (n=230) were reported among pilgrims, with hypertension being the most reported morbidity (n=124, 53.9%). The majority of pilgrims had taken immunization prior to travel to Saudi Arabia, and the most commonly reported immunizations were meningitis (n=567, 56%), influenza (n=460, 45.5%), and Hepatitis B virus vaccinations (n=324, 32%); however, 223(22%) had not received any vaccinations prior to travel, including meningitis vaccine, which is mandatory in Saudi Arabia. 305 pilgrims (30.1%) had reported never using face masks in crowded areas; however, 63.2% reported lack of availability of these masks. The majority of participants had received health education on preventive measures, including hygienic aspects (n=799, 78.9%) mostly in their home countries (n=450, 56.3%). A positive association was found between receiving health education and practicing of preventive measures, such as wearing masks in crowded areas (P= 0.04) and other health practice scores (P= 0.02). Conclusion Although the experiences of the preventive measures among pilgrims in terms of health education, vaccinations, and hygienic practices were overall positive, this study identified several issues with the following preventive measures: immunizations particularly meningitis vaccine and using face masks in crowded areas. Further studies are required to develop a health education module to promote comprehensive preventive measures for pilgrims.

Here, we measured acute humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the frequency of antibody-secreting cells and the presence of specific, neutralizing, antibodies in serum and broncho-alveolar fluid of 145 patients with COVID-19. Surprisingly, early SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses were found to be typically dominated by antibodies of the IgA isotype. Peripheral expansion of IgA-plasmablasts with mucosal-homing potential was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms and peaked during the third week of the disease. While the specific antibody response included IgG, IgM and IgA, the latter contributed to a much larger extent to virus neutralization, as compared to IgG. However, specific IgA serum levels notably decrease after one month of evolution. These results represent a challenging observation given the present uncertainty as to which kind of humoral response would optimally protect against re-infection, and whether vaccine regimens should consider boosting a potent, although, at least in blood, fading IgA response.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Delphine Sterlin","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Alexis Mathian","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Makoto Miyara","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Audrey Mohr","author_inst":"Centre Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Paris"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur, Paris"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Claer","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Paul Quentric","author_inst":"Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Paris"},{"author_name":"Jehane Fadlallah","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Pacale Ghillani","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Cary Gunn","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Rick Hockett","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Sasi Mudumba","author_inst":"Genlayte Inc"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Charles-Edouard Luyt","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Beurton","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Salma Fourati","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Lacorte","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Hans Yssel","author_inst":"Centre d Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses"},{"author_name":"Christophe Parizot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Karim Dorgham","author_inst":"Centre d Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Paris"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Ruben Niesvizky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Lentzsch","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gareth Morgan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20127092","rel_title":"Antibody response to infectious diseases and other factors accurately predict COVID-19 infection and severity risk 10-14 years later: a retrospective UK Biobank cohort study","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20127092","rel_abs":"Background: Several risk factors have emerged for novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and severity. Yet, it is unknown to what degree these risk factors alone or in combination can accurately predict who is most at risk. It is also worthwhile to consider serological antibody titers to non COVID-19 infectious diseases, which may influence host immunity to COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study of multicenter UK Biobank participants, as of May 26th 2020, all COVID-19 testing data was collected by Public Health England for older adult in- and out-patients (69.6 {+\/-} 8.8 years). We used linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation and bootstrapping to determine the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of baseline data from 2006-2010 to predict COVID-19 infection and presumptive severity (i.e., testing at hospital). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to derive the area under the curve (AUC). Findings: This retrospective study included 4,510 unique participants and 7,539 testing instances (i.e., test cases). Testing resulted in 5,329 negative cases and 2,210 positive cases, split into 996 mild and 1,214 severe disease outcomes. Baseline data including demographics, bioimpedance-derived body composition, vitals, serum biochemistry, self-reported illness\/disability, and complete blood count. A randomized subset of 80 participants with 124 test cases also had antibody titers for 20 common to rare infectious diseases. Among all test cases, accuracy was modest for final diagnostic models of COVID-19 infection (70.2%; AUC=0.570, CI=0.556-0.584) and severity (58.3%; AUC=0.592, CI=0.568-0.615). In the sub-group with serology, by contrast, final models predicted infection and severity with an accuracy of 93.5% (AUC=0.969, CI=0.934-1.000) and 74.4% (AUC=0.803, CI=0.663-0.943) respectively. Models included titers to common pathogens (e.g., human cytomegalovirus), age, blood cell counts, lipids, and other biochemical markers. Interpretation: Serological titers for infectious diseases and other risk factors could help policy makers and clinicians better identify who may get COVID-19 and require hospitalization.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Auriel A Willette","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Sara A Willette","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Colleen Pappas","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Brandon S Klinedinst","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Scott Le","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Brittany Larsen","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Amy Pollpeter","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Brenner","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Tim Waterboer","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Rick Hockett","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Sasi Mudumba","author_inst":"Genlayte Inc"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Charles-Edouard Luyt","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Beurton","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Salma Fourati","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Lacorte","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Hans Yssel","author_inst":"Centre d Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses"},{"author_name":"Christophe Parizot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Karim Dorgham","author_inst":"Centre d Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Paris"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Ruben Niesvizky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Lentzsch","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gareth Morgan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20127050","rel_title":"Plasma from recovered COVID19 subjects inhibits spike protein binding to ACE2 in a microsphere-based inhibition assay","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20127050","rel_abs":"High throughput serological tests that can establish the presence and functional activity of anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies are urgently needed. Here we present microsphere-based Flow Cytometry assays that quantify both anti-spike IgGs in plasma, and the ability of plasma to inhibit the binding of spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). First, we detected anti-trimer IgGs in 22\/24 and anti-RBD IgGs in 21\/24 COVID+ subjects at a median of 36 (range 14-73) days following documented SARS-CoV-2 RNA (+) secretions. Next, we find that plasma from all 22\/24 subjects with anti-trimer IgGs inhibited ACE2-trimer binding to a greater degree than controls, and that the degree of inhibition correlated with anti-trimer IgG levels. Depletion of trimer-reactive Igs from plasma reduced ACE2-trimer inhibitory capacity to a greater degree than depletion of RBD-reactive Igs, suggesting that inhibitory antibodies act by binding both within and outside of the RBD. Amongst the 24 subjects, presence of fever was associated with higher levels of anti-trimer IgG and inhibition of binding to human ACE2. This inhibition assay may be broadly useful to quantify the functional antibody response of recovered COVID19 patients or vaccine recipients in a cell-free assay system.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward P Gniffke","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Whitney E Harrington","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Dambrauskas","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yonghou Jiang","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Olesya Trakhimets","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Reserach Institute"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Vigdorovich","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

In this study, we demonstrate the utility of monitoring the daily number of patients with COVID-like illness (CLI) who present to the Emergency Department (ED) as a tool that can guide local response efforts. Methods Using data from two hospitals in King County, WA, we examined the daily volume of CLI visits, and compare them to confirmed COVID cases and COVID deaths in the County. A linear regression model with varying lags is used to predict the number of daily COVID deaths from the number of CLI visits. Results CLI visits appear to rise and peak well in advance of both confirmed COVID cases and deaths in King County. Our regression analysis to predict daily deaths with a lagged count of CLI visits in the ED showed that the R2 value was maximized at 14 days.

Our method to estimate the reproductive number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors enhances previous approaches by considering a dynamic prior continuously updated as restrictive measures and comportments within the society evolve. In addition, to allow direct comparison between reproductive number and introduction of public health measures in a specific country, the infection dates are inferred from daily confirmed cases and death with the mean time between a case being declared as positive and its death estimated on 1430 cases at 10.7 days. The evolution of the reproductive rate in combination with the stringency index is analyzed on 31 European countries. We show that most countries required tough state interventions with a stringency index equal to 83.6 out of 100 to reduce the reproductive number below one and control the progression of the epidemic. In addition, we show a direct correlation between the time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the epidemic with a median time of 8 days. Our analysis reinforces the importance of having a fast response with a coherent and comprehensive set of confinement measures to control the epidemic. Only combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have shown to be effective.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hugues Turbe","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mina Bjelogrlic","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Robert","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christophe Gaudet-Blavignac","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

It provides an opportunity to examine the effect of the lockdown and of other events on the dynamics of the epidemic. In particular, it has been suggested that municipal elections held just before lockdown was ordered may have helped spread the virus. In this manuscript we use Bayesian models of the number of deaths through time to study the epidemic in 13 regions of France. We found that the models accurately predict the number of deaths 2 to 3 weeks in advance, and recover estimates that are in agreement with recent models that rely on a different structure and different input data. In particular, the lockdown reduced the viral reproduction number by {approx} 80%. However, using a mixture model, we found that the lockdown had had different effectiveness depending on the region, and that it had been slightly more effective in decreasing the reproduction number in denser regions. The mixture model predicts that 2.08 (95% CI : 1.85-2.47) million people had been infected by May 11, and that there were 2567 (95% CI : 1781-5182) new infections on May 10. We found no evidence that the reproduction numbers differ between week-ends and week days, and no evidence that the reproduction numbers increased on the election day. Finally, we evaluated counterfactual scenarios showing that ordering the lockdown 1 to 7 days sooner would have resulted in 19% to 76% fewer deaths, but that ordering it 1 to 7 days later would have resulted in 21% to 266% more deaths. Overall, the predictions of the model indicate that holding the elections on March 15 did not have a detectable impact on the total number of deaths, unless it motivated a delay in imposing the lockdown.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louis Duchemin","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Philippe Veber","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Bastien Boussau","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Gaudet-Blavignac","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

We include four sets of variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes of commuting, and climate and pollution patterns. Our analysis studies daily death rates from April 4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We estimate correlation patterns both across states, as well as within states. For both models, we find higher shares of African American residents in the county are correlated with higher death rates. However, when we restrict ourselves to correlation patterns within a given state, the statistical significance of the correlation of death rates with the share of African Americans, while remaining positive, wanes. We find similar results for the share of elderly in the county. We find that higher amounts of commuting via public transportation, relative to telecommuting, is correlated with higher death rates. The correlation between driving into work, relative to telecommuting, and death rates is also positive across both models, but statistically significant only when we look across states and counties. We also find that a higher share of people not working, and thus not commuting either because they are elderly, children or unemployed, is correlated with higher death rates. Counties with higher home values, higher summer temperatures, and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates. Contrary to past work, we do not find a correlation between pollution and death rates. Also importantly, we do not find that death rates are correlated with obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates. Finally, our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given state's death rate compares to other states after controlling for the variables included in our model; this may be interpreted as a measure of how states are doing relative to others. We find that death rates in the Northeast are substantially higher compared to other states, even when we control for the four sets of variables above. Death rates are also statistically significantly higher in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. California's death rate is the lowest across all states.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher R Knittel","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Bora Ozaltun","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Bastien Boussau","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Gaudet-Blavignac","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

We propose a simple method to calculate a figure of merit FC to provide an early characterization of the disease status in country C. METHODS We use mathematical tools to adjust a Gaussian function to the daily increase of infected patients. Maximum value and full width half maximum of the Gaussian are characteristics of the development of the development of the pandemic in each country. These parameters are supplemented by the testing volume and the mortality rate to produce just one characterizing parameter: FC. In addition, the stability of the Gaussian fits was calculated within an entire week towards the end of the study period. Seventeen different countries were fully considered, while others are considered when discussing particular properties. Data employed is publically available. FINDINGS Fitted Gaussian functions render effective information about the development of COVID-19. The number of critical days vary between 11 (South Korea) and 52 (Mexico). FC varies between 1 (Australia) and 899 (Mexico). The epidemic appears stabilized in some countries and unstable in others. Some large countries are experiencing fast development of the propagation of the disease with high FC. A correlation between low (high) values of the mortality rate (and to some extent FC) and the presence (absence) of BCG vaccination is exposed. INTERPRETATION The adjustment of a Gaussian to daily data of COVID-19 in each country reveals the different propagation dynamics, properly characterized by the parameters proposed here. Testing plays a clear role to control the spread of the disease. Mortality rate spans more than one order of magnitude and is somewhat related to permanent massive BCG vaccination. The figure of merit, FC, introduced here spans more than 2 orders of magnitude which makes it a useful indicator to quickly find out the status of the pandemics in each territory. Geography plays a role: low population density and isolated countries can be efficient in controlling the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricio Vargas","author_inst":"Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Allende","author_inst":"Universidad de Santiago de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eugenio E Vogel","author_inst":"Universidad de La Frontera"},{"author_name":"Sigismund Kobe","author_inst":"Technische Universitat Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

Many patients with lung cancer are thought to be affected by this situation. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling. Study design: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were undergoing anti-cancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600 beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Methods: After the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay. Results: A total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced the delay of lung cancer treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with treatment delay received significantly more ICIs monotherapy than patients without treatment delay (p=0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular target agents experienced treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic period (p=0.0027). The treatments of most of the patients were delayed per their request. Conclusion: We revealed 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic. Oncologists should keep in mind that patient with cancer have more anxiety than we expected under special occasions such as COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kohei Fujita","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Takanori Ito","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zentaro Saito","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Osamu Kanai","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Koichi Nakatani","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tadashi Mio","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

We examined self-reported changes in solo and sexual behaviors in U.S. adults during early stages of the public health response to COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online, nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults (N=1010; aged 18-94 years; 62% response rate) from April 10-20, 2020. We used weighted multinomial logistic regression to examine past month self-reported changes (decreased, stable or increased) in ten solo and partnered sexual behaviors. Predictor variables included: having children at home, past month depressive symptoms, (ACHA 3-item scale), past month loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), COVID-19 protection behaviors (adapted 12-item scale), perceived COVID-19 consequences (adapted 10-item scale) and COVID-19 knowledge (adapted 10-item scale). Findings: Nearly half of all adults reported some kind of change, most commonly, a decrease, in their sexual behavior in the past month. Having elementary aged children at home, past month depressive symptoms and loneliness and enacting more COVID-19 protective behaviors were associated with both reduced partnered bonding behaviors, such as hugging, cuddling, holding hands and kissing, as well as reduced partnered sexual behaviors, such as oral sex, partnered genital touching and vaginal sex. Greater COVID19 risk perception and greater COVID19 knowledge were associated with mixed effects in behavior outcomes. Interpretations: Our data illustrate the very personal ways in which different pandemic-associated factors may create or inhibit opportunities for solo and partnered sex. The centrality of sexuality to health and well-being, even during pandemics, means that a critical piece of public health prevention and management responses should is ensuring that services and resource that support positive sexual decision making remain open and available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Devon J.

Studies suggested that obesity was a major risk factor for its hospitalization and severity of symptoms. This study investigated the associations between obesity prevalence with overall COVID-19 cases and related deaths across states in the United States. General regression and Chi-square tests were used to examine those associations. The analyses indicated that obesity prevalence (%) across states were negatively associated with COVID-19 cases (p = 0.0448) and related deaths (p = 0.0181), with a decrease of 158 cases\/100K population and 13 deaths\/100K for every 5% increase of the obesity prevalence. When the states were divided based on the median of obesity prevalence (30.9%) into a group of states with low obesity prevalence and a group with high obesity prevalence, both the cases (671 vs 416 cases\/100k population) and deaths (39 vs 21 deaths\/100k population) were significantly different (p < 0.001) across groups. These findings provided important information for the relationship between the dual pandemic threats of obesity and COVID-19. These results should not currently be considered as an indication that obesity is a protective factor for COVID-19, and would rather be used as a warning of the public advice that obese people is more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, which may lead to a false safety message probably given to people with normal body weight.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ning Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},{"author_name":"Lorraine S.

The patients demonstrate a great diversity in clinical and laboratory manifestations and disease severity. Nonetheless, little is known about the host genetic contribution to the observed inter-individual phenotypic variability. Here, we report the first host genetic study in China by deeply sequencing and analyzing the 332 COVID-19 patients categorized by varying levels of severity from the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital. Based on a total of 22.2 million genetic variants, we conducted both single-variant and gene-based association tests among the five severity groups including asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical ill patients after the correction of potential confounding factors. The most significant gene loci associated with severity is located in TMEM189-UBE2V1 involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway. The p.Val197Met missense variant that affects the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein displays a decreasing allele frequency among the severe patients compared to the mild and the general population. We also identified that the HLA-A*11:01, B*51:01 and C*14:02 alleles significantly predispose the worst outcome of the patients. This initial study of Chinese patients provides a comprehensive view of the genetic difference among the COVID-19 patient groups and highlighted genes and variants that may help guide targeted efforts in containing the outbreak. Limitations and advantages of the study were also reviewed to guide future international efforts on elucidating the genetic architecture of host-pathogen interaction for COVID-19 and other infectious and complex diseases.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fang Wang","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shujia Huang","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huirong Gao","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yuwen Zhou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Changxiang Lai","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Xian","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhiyu Li","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yushan Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Qiyuan Tang","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Panhong Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ruikun Chen","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Rong Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Tong Xin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhou Xuan","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yong Bai","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Gang Duan","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Siyang Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20125690","rel_title":"Proteomic Profiling in Biracial Cohorts Implicates DC-SIGN as a Mediator of Genetic Risk in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20125690","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is one of the most consequential pandemics in the last century, yet the biological mechanisms that confer disease risk are incompletely understood. Further, heterogeneity in disease outcomes is influenced by race, though the relative contributions of structural\/social and genetic factors remain unclear. Very recent unpublished work has identified two genetic risk loci that confer greater risk for respiratory failure in COVID-19: the ABO locus and the 3p21.31 locus. To understand how these loci might confer risk and whether this differs by race, we utilized proteomic profiling and genetic information from three cohorts including black and white participants to identify proteins influenced by these loci. We observed that variants in the ABO locus are associated with levels of CD209\/DC-SIGN, a known binding protein for SARS-CoV and other viruses, as well as multiple inflammatory and thrombotic proteins, while the 3p21.31 locus is associated with levels of CXCL16, a known inflammatory chemokine. Thus, integration of genetic information and proteomic profiling in biracial cohorts highlights putative mechanisms for genetic risk in COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel H.

Here, we formulate agent-based models that simulate the spread of a respiratory infectious disease in a train wagon in the Manila Light Rail Transit System, and in a 49-seater public utility bus. We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing, and limitation of interaction or movement among the commuters to investigate how these measures will inhibit disease transmission. We also consider the effect of protective gears and practices, crowd density, and prevalence of disease in the community on the possible number of newly-infected individuals. Our simulations show that (i) individuals must have protection with more than 90% effectiveness to inhibit transmission of the disease; (ii) social or physical distancing by more than 1m distance reduces the risk of being infected; (iii) minimizing movement or interaction with other passengers reduces the risk of transmission by 50%; (iv) passenger capacity should be less than 10-50% of the maximum seating capacity to reduce the number of infections depending on the level of imposed social distancing and passenger interaction; (v) vehicles with greater number of occupied seating capacity generate higher number of infections but vehicles with smaller dimensions have faster disease transmissions; and (vi) ideal set-up for a 24-seater train wagon (49-seater bus) is to allow a maximum of 12 (24) passengers, with little to no interaction among passengers, with social distancing of more than 1m distance apart, and each person has a protection with 90% effectiveness as much as possible.

We here study the relationship between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We show that those two are approximately the same in exponential models and across most models currently used in the study of epidemics, independently of the model parameters.

Aims We investigated whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. Methods 502,640 participants aged 40-69 years at baseline (54-79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK 2006-10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried's classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16\/03\/2020-01\/06\/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Results 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive=1,326, negative=3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR=1.3 [95% CI=1.1, 1.7]), report slow walking speed (OR=1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR=1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid ([&ge;]4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR=1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Furthermore, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COIVD-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. Discussion and conclusions Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of a positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S J Woolford","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"S D'angelo","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"E M Curtis","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C M Parsons","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"K A Ward","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"E M Dennison","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"H P Patel","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C Cooper","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"N C Harvey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Albert Pereta","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Chris Danford","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Amine Kamel","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Patrik Gothe","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evrhet Milam","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Jean Aurambault","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Thorben Primke","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Claire Li","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Josh Inkenbrandt","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Tuan Huynh","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evan Chen","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Christina Lee","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Michael Croatto","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Helen Bentley","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Wendy Lu","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Robert Murray","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Mark Travassos","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Openshaw","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Brent Coull","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Casey Greene","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ophir Shalem","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Probasco","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"David Cheng","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Ben Silbermann","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Harvard University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126128","rel_title":"Poorly known aspects of flattening the curve of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126128","rel_abs":"This work concerns the too-often mentioned flattening of the curve of COVID-19. The diffusion of the virus is analyzed with logistic-curve fits on the 25 countries most affected at the time of the writing and in which the diffusion curve was more than 95% completed. A negative correlation observed between the final number of infections and the slope of the logistic curve corroborates a result obtained long time ago via an extensive simulation study. There is both theoretical arguments and experimental evidence for the existence of such correlations. The flattening of the curve results in a retardation of the curve's midpoint, which entails an increase in the final number of infections. It is possible that more lives are lost at the end by this process. Our analysis also permits evaluation of the various governments' interventions in terms of rapidity of response, efficiency of the actions taken (the amount of flattening achieved), and the number of days by which the curve was delayed. Not surprisingly, early decisive response proves to be the optimum strategy among the countries studied.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alain Debecker","author_inst":"Institut de Maintien \u00e0 Domicile"},{"author_name":"Theodore Modis","author_inst":"Growth Dynamics"},{"author_name":"E M Curtis","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C M Parsons","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"K A Ward","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"E M Dennison","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"H P Patel","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C Cooper","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"N C Harvey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Albert Pereta","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Chris Danford","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Amine Kamel","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Patrik Gothe","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evrhet Milam","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Jean Aurambault","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Thorben Primke","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Claire Li","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Josh Inkenbrandt","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Tuan Huynh","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evan Chen","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Christina Lee","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Michael Croatto","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Helen Bentley","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Wendy Lu","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Robert Murray","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Mark Travassos","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Openshaw","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Brent Coull","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Casey Greene","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ophir Shalem","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Probasco","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"David Cheng","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Ben Silbermann","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Harvard University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20125724","rel_title":"Estimating Force of Infection from Serologic Surveys with Imperfect Tests","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20125724","rel_abs":"The force of infection, or the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected, is an important public health measure for assessing the extent of outbreaks and the impact of control programs. Here we present methods for estimating force of infection from serological surveys of infections which produce lasting immunity, taking into account imperfections in the test used, and uncertainty in such imperfections. The methods cover both single serological surveys, in which age is a proxy for time at risk, and repeat surveys in the same people, in which the force of infection is estimated more directly. Fixed values can be used for the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, or existing methods for belief elicitation can be used to include uncertainty in these values. The latter may be applicable, for example, when the specificity of a test depends on co-circulating pathogens, which may not have been well characterized in the setting of interest. We illustrate the methods using data from two published serological studies of dengue.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neal Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mabel Carabali","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Kyungah Lim","author_inst":"Global Dengue and Aedes-transmitted Diseases Consortium (GDAC), International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"C M Parsons","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"K A Ward","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"E M Dennison","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"H P Patel","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C Cooper","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"N C Harvey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Albert Pereta","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Chris Danford","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Amine Kamel","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Patrik Gothe","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evrhet Milam","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Jean Aurambault","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Thorben Primke","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Claire Li","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Josh Inkenbrandt","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Tuan Huynh","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evan Chen","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Christina Lee","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Michael Croatto","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Helen Bentley","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Wendy Lu","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Robert Murray","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Mark Travassos","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Openshaw","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Brent Coull","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Casey Greene","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ophir Shalem","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Probasco","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"David Cheng","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Ben Silbermann","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Harvard University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20125831","rel_title":"Estimation of effects of contact tracing and mask adoption on COVID-19 transmission in San Francisco: a modeling study","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20125831","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has spurred concern about what interventions may be effective at reducing transmission. The city and county of San Francisco imposed a shelter-in-place order in March 2020, followed by use of a contact tracing program and a policy requiring use of cloth face masks. We used statistical estimation and simulation to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions in San Francisco. We estimated that self-isolation and other practices beginning at the time of San Francisco's shelter-in-place order reduced the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 by 35.4% (95% CI, -20.1%--81.4%). We estimated the effect of contact tracing on the effective reproduction number to be a reduction of approximately 44% times the fraction of cases that are detected, which may be modest if the detection rate is low. We estimated the impact of cloth mask adoption on reproduction number to be approximately 8.6%, and note that the benefit of mask adoption may be substantially greater for essential workers and other vulnerable populations, residents return to circulating outside the home more often. We estimated the effect of those interventions on incidence by simulating counterfactual scenarios in which contact tracing was not adopted, cloth masks were not adopted, and neither contact tracing nor cloth masks was adopted, and found increases in case counts that were modest, but relatively larger than the effects on reproduction numbers. These estimates and model results suggest that testing coverage and timing of testing and contact tracing may be important, and that modest effects on reproduction numbers can nonetheless cause substantial effects on case counts over time.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lee Worden","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rae Wannier","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Seth Blumberg","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alex Y.
