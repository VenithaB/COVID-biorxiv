By using a unique human mobility dataset containing 547,166 flights with a total capacity of 101,455,913 passengers among 22 countries during the past three months, we analyze the associations between international travel movement in six continents and the new infections in these countries. Results show that policymakers should move away from the previous practices that focus only on restricting hotspot areas with high transmission rates. Instead, they should develop a new holistic view of global human mobility to adjust the international movement restriction. The study highlights that international human mobility is the key to understand the transmission pathways and the small world phenomenon in the global network of COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Li-Xian Qian","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"},{"author_name":"Jian-Qiang Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20108571","rel_title":"A score-based risk model for predicting severe COVID-19 infection as a key component of lockdown exit strategy","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20108571","rel_abs":"Background: As many countries consider and employ various lockdown exit strategies, health authorities seek tools to provide differential targeted advice for social distancing based on personal risk for severe COVID-19. However, striking a balance between a scientifically precise multivariable risk prediction model, and a model which can easily be used by the general public, remains a challenge. A list of risk criteria, as defined by the CDC for example, provides a simple solution, but may be too inclusive by classifying a substantial portion of the population at high risk. Score-based risk classification tools may provide a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity. Objective: To create a score-based risk classification tool for severe COVID-19. Methods: The outcome was defined as a composite of being labeled severe during hospitalization or dying due to COVID-19. The risk classification tool was developed using retrospective data from all COVID-19 patients that were diagnosed until April 1st, 2020 in a large healthcare organization (\"training set\"). The developed tool combines 10 risk factors using simple summation, and defines three risk levels according to the patient's age and number of accumulated risk points - basic risk, high risk and very-high risk (the last two levels are also considered together as the elevated risk group). The tool's performance in accurately identifying individuals at risk was evaluated using a \"temporal test set\" of COVID-19 patients diagnosed between April 2nd and April 22nd, 2020, later than those used for model development. The tool's performance was also compared to that of the CDC's criteria. The healthcare organization's general population was used to evaluate the proportion of patients that would be classified to each of the model's risk levels and as elevated risk by the CDC criteria. Results: A total of 2,421, 2,624 and 4,631,168 individuals were included in the training, test, and general population cohorts, respectively. The outcome rate in the training and test sets was 5%. Overall, 18% of the general population would be classified at elevated risk by the model, with a resulting sensitivity of 92%, compared to 35% that would be defined as elevated risk by the CDC criteria, with a resulting sensitivity of 96%. Within the model's elevated risk groups, the high and very-high risk groups comprised 15% and 3% of the general population, with an incidence rate (PPV) of 15% and 33%, respectively. Discussion: A simple to communicate score-based risk classification tool classifies at elevated risk about half of the population that is considered to have an elevated risk by the CDC risk criteria, with only a 4% reduction in sensitivity. The model's ability to further divide the elevated risk population into two markedly different subgroups allows providing more refined recommendations to the general public and limiting the restrictions of social distancing to a smaller and more manageable subset of the population. This model was adopted by the Israeli ministry of health as its risk classification tool for COVID-19 lab tests prioritization and for targeting its instructions on risk management during the lockdown exit strategy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noa Dagan","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noam Barda","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dan Riesel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Itamar Grotto","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Siegal Sadetzki","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20109116","rel_title":"Improved measurement of racial\/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20109116","rel_abs":"Different estimation methods produce diverging accounts of racial\/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality in the United States. The CDC's decision to present the racial\/ethnic distribution of COVID-19 deaths at the state level alongside re-weighted racial\/ethnic population distributions -- in effect, a geographic adjustment -- makes it seem that Whites have the highest death rates. Age adjustment procedures used by others, including the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, lead to the opposite conclusion that Blacks and Hispanics are dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. In this paper, we use indirect standardization methods to adjust per-capita death rates for both age and geography simultaneously, avoiding the one-sided adjustment procedures currently in use. Using CDC data, we find age-and-place- adjusted COVID-19 death rates are 80% higher for Blacks and more than 50% higher for Hispanics, relative to Whites, on a national level, while there is almost no disparity for Asians. State-specific estimates show wide variation in mortality disparities. Comparison with non- epidemic mortality reveals potential roles for pre-existing health disparities and differential rates of infection and care.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Robert Goldstein","author_inst":"Department of Demography, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Serge Atherwood","author_inst":"Department of Demography, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Dan Riesel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Itamar Grotto","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Siegal Sadetzki","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108753","rel_title":"Forecasting trajectories of an emerging epidemic with mathematical modeling in an online dashboard: The case of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108753","rel_abs":"We offer an efficient mathematical model for forecasting the course of an emerging epidemic, with COVID-19 as a use case.

For example, weather conditions impact the prevalence of respiratory diseases with symptoms similar to COVID-19, and this will likely influence the number of tests performed.

Mathematical modelling of reported and unreported COVID-19 infected cases","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108621","rel_abs":"Starting from the city of Wuhan in China in late December 2019, the pandemic quickly spread to the rest of the world along the main intercontinental air routes. At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V (t), and unreported infected cases U(t). This work measures the basic reproduction number R0, which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an R0 = 2.73. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an Rt = 0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ines Abdeljaoued-Tej","author_inst":"BIMS Laboratory, LR16IPT09, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Moritz Schwarz","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sihan Li","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yangsiyu Lu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anant Jani","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.108035","rel_title":"Methods of inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 for downstream biological assays","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.108035","rel_abs":"The scientific community has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by rapidly undertaking research to find effective strategies to reduce the burden of this disease.

To facilitate the transfer of infectious samples from high containment laboratories, we have tested methods commonly used to inactivate virus and prepare the sample for additional experiments. Incubation at 80{degrees}C, and a range of detergents and UV energies were successful at inactivating a high titre of SARS-CoV-2.

Humoral immune responses likely play an important role in containing SARS-CoV-2, however, the determinants of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are unclear.\n\nMethodsUsing immunoassays specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we determined SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera and mucosal fluids of two cohorts, including patients with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 56; median age 61 years) with mild versus severe COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers (n = 109; median age 36 years) with or without symptoms and tested negative or positive by RT-qPCR.\n\nFindingsOn average, SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA titers in mild COVID-19 cases became positive eight days after symptom onset and were often transient, whereas serum IgG levels remained negative or reached positive values 9-10 days after symptom onset. Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly significant increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA and IgG titers as a function of duration since symptom onset, independent of patient age and comorbidities. Very high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA correlated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, some of the SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG serum titers had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies in their nasal fluids and tears. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA levels in nasal fluids of these healthcare workers were inversely correlated with patient age.\n\nInterpretationThese data show that systemic IgA and IgG production against SARS-CoV-2 develops mainly in severe COVID-19, with very high IgA levels seen in patients with severe ARDS, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient serum titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies but stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA secretion. The findings suggest four grades of antibody responses dependent on COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlo Cervia","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jakob Nilsson","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Yves Zurbuchen","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alan Valaperti","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jens Schreiner","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Aline Wolfensberger","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, USZ, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Miro E.

Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the developing mouse lung with temporally-resolved RNA-in-situ hybridization (ISH) in mouse and human lung tissue, we found that expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein primer TMPRSS2 was highest in ciliated cells and type I alveolar epithelial cells (AT1), and TMPRSS2 expression was increased with aging in mice and humans. Analysis of autopsy tissue from fatal COVID-19 cases revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected most frequently in ciliated and secretory cells in the airway epithelium and AT1 cells in the peripheral lung. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highly colocalized in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Together, these data demonstrate the cellular spectrum infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung epithelium, and suggest that developmental regulation of TMPRSS2 may underlie the relative protection of infants and children from severe respiratory illness.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryce A Schuler","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"A Christian Habermann","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Erin J Plosa","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Chase J Taylor","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Christopher S Jetter","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Meghan E Kapp","author_inst":"Department Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"John Benjamin","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Peter Gulleman","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"David S Nichols","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Lior Z Braunstein","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York"},{"author_name":"Michael H Koval","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta,  GA; Department of Cell Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Susan H Guttentag","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Timothy S Blackwell","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and D"},{"author_name":"- Vanderbilt COVID-19 Consortium Cohort","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Steven A Webber","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Banovich","author_inst":"Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ"},{"author_name":"Jonathan A Kropski","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and D"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MS Sucre","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt"},{"author_name":"- HCA Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Held","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, at Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elsbeth Probst-Mueller","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvana K.

Viral surveillance is costly but rarely optimized using model-guided prioritization strategies, and predictions from a single model may be highly uncertain. Here, we generate an ensemble of eight network- and trait-based statistical models that predict mammal-virus associations, and we use model predictions to develop a set of priority recommendations for sampling potential bat reservoirs and intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses. We find over 200 bat species globally could be undetected hosts of betacoronaviruses. Although over a dozen species of Asian horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) are known to harbor SARS-like coronaviruses, we find at least two thirds of betacoronavirus reservoirs in this bat genus might still be undetected. Although identification of other probable mammal reservoirs is likely beyond existing predictive capacity, some of our findings are surprisingly plausible; for example, several civet and pangolin species were highlighted as high-priority species for viral sampling. Our results should not be over-interpreted as novel information about the plausibility or likelihood of SARS-CoV-2s ultimate origin, but rather these predictions could help guide sampling for novel potentially zoonotic viruses; immunological research to characterize key receptors (e.g., ACE2) and identify mechanisms of viral tolerance; and experimental infections to quantify competence of suspected host species.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Becker","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Gregory F Albery","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Anna R Sjodin","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Timothee Poisot","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Tad Dallas","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Evan A.

This work will enable large scale serosurveillance, which can play an important role in the months and years to come to implement efficient containment and mitigation measures, as well as help develop therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Per Niklas Hedde","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Timothy J Abram","author_inst":"Velox Biosystems"},{"author_name":"Aarti Jain","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rie Nakajima","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rafael Ramiro de Assis","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Trevor Pearce","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Algis Jasinskas","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Melody N Toosky","author_inst":"Velox Biosystems"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Enrico Gratton","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Weian Zhao","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Colin J Carlson","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"- Vanderbilt COVID-19 Consortium Cohort","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Steven A Webber","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Banovich","author_inst":"Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ"},{"author_name":"Jonathan A Kropski","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and D"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MS Sucre","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt"},{"author_name":"- HCA Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Held","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, at Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elsbeth Probst-Mueller","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvana K.

Of these tested small molecule medicines, six displayed an IC50 value in inhibiting MPro below 100 M. Three medicines pimozide, ebastine, and bepridil are basic small molecules. Their uses in COVID-19 patients potentiate dual functions by both raising endosomal pH to slow SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human cell host and inhibiting MPro in infected cells. A live virus-based microneutralization assay showed that bepridil inhibited cytopathogenic effect induced by SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells completely at and dose-dependently below 5 M and in A549 cells completely at and dose-dependently below 6.25 M.

Computational methods to predict serodiagnostic epitopes that are specific for the pathogen could help accelerate the development of new diagnostics. A systematic survey of 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins was conducted to assess whether existing B-cell epitope prediction methods, combined with comprehensive mining of sequence databases and structural data, could predict whether a particular protein would be suitable for serodiagnosis. Nine of the predictions were validated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the ELISA format using plasma and sera from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a further 11 predictions were compared to the recent literature. Results appeared to be in agreement with 12 of the predictions, in disagreement with 3, while a further 5 were deemed inconclusive. We showed that two of our top five candidates, the N-terminal fragment of the nucleoprotein and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, have the highest sensitivity and specificity and signal-to-noise ratio for detecting COVID-19 sera\/plasma by ELISA. Mixing the two antigens together for coating ELISA plates led to a sensitivity of 94% (N=80 samples from persons with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection), and a specificity of 97.2% (N=106 control samples).","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."},{"author_name":"Lauren Carter","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."},{"author_name":"Neil King","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."},{"author_name":"Ivan Anishchenko","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Lynn K Barrett","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Justin K Craig","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Logan Tillery","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Roger Shek","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"David M Koelle","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Anna Wald","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Jim Boonyaratanakornkit","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Nina Isoherranen","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Helen Chu","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Wesley C Van Voorhis","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Jonathan A Kropski","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and D"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MS Sucre","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt"},{"author_name":"- HCA Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Held","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, at Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elsbeth Probst-Mueller","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvana K.

Instead, rapid interventions successfully prevented onward transmission of those early cases in Germany and Washington State.

Presently there are more than 800 COVID-19 clinical trials globally, many with drug combinations, resulting in an empirical process with an enormous number of possible combinations. To identify the most promising potential therapies, we developed a biophysical model for the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle and performed a sensitivity analysis for individual model parameters and all possible pairwise parameter changes (162 = 256 possibilities). We found that model-predicted virion production is fairly insensitive to changes in most viral entry, assembly, and release parameters, but highly sensitive to some viral transcription and translation parameters. Furthermore, we found a cooperative benefit to pairwise targeting of transcription and translation, predicting that combined targeting of these processes will be especially effective in inhibiting viral production.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian T Castle","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Carissa Dock","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Mahya Hemmat","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Susan Kline","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Christopher Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David Masopust","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Paolo Provenzano","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Langlois","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Timothy Schacker","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ashley Haase","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David J Odde","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Ungaro","author_inst":"The Dr. Henry D.

Participants 31,180 live singleton infants born in Denmark between March 12, and April 14, from 2015 to 2020 Main outcome measures The Main outcome measure was the odds ratio of premature birth, per preterm category, during the lockdown period compared with the calendar match period in the five previous years. Results A total of 31 180 newborns were included in the study period, of these 58 were born extremely premature (gestational age below 28 weeks). The distribution of gestational ages was significantly different (p = 0.004) during the lockdown period compared to the previous five years. The extremely premature birth rate during the lockdown was significantly lower than the corresponding mean rate for the same dates in the previous years (odds ratio 0.09 [95 % CI 0.01 - 0.04], p < 0.001). No significant difference between the lockdown and previous years was found for other gestational age categories. Conclusions The birth rate of extremely premature infants decreased significantly (~90 % reduction) during the Danish nationwide lockdown from a stable rate in the preceding five years. The reasons for this decrease are unclear. Identification of possible causal mechanisms might stimulate changes in clinical practice. Ideally, some cases of extreme prematurity are preventable which may decrease infant morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gitte Hedermann","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Paula L Hedley","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Marie Baekvad-Hansen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Klaus Rostgaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Porntiva Poorisrisak","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Morten Breindahl","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Mads Melbye","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"David Hougaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Michael Christiansen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Ulrik Lausten-Thomsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"David J Odde","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Ungaro","author_inst":"The Dr. Henry D.

Design: Ecological retrospective cohort study Setting Local authority districts (LADs) in England, Scotland and Wales (Great Britain (GB)). Participants All LAD deaths registered by week 16 of 2020. Main Outcome Measures Death registration where COVID-19 is mentioned as a contributing factor per 100,000 people in all settings, and in i) cares homes, ii) hospitals or iii) home only, in comparison to non-COVID-19 related deaths. Results Across GB by week 16 of 2020, 20,684 deaths had been registered mentioning COVID-19, equivalent to 25.6 per 100,000 people. Significant risk factors for LAD COVID-19 death in comparison to non-COVID-19 related death were air pollution and proportion of the population who were female. Significant protective factors were higher air temperature and proportion of the population who were ex-smokers. Conversely, for all COVID-19 unrelated deaths in comparison to COVID-19 deaths, higher rates of communal living, higher population rates of chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease deaths under 75 and dementia were predictive of death, whereas, higher rates of flight passengers was protective. Looking at individual setttings, the most notable findings in care homes was Scotland being a significant risk factor for COVID-19 related deaths compared to England. For hospital setting, the proportion of the population who were from black and Asian minority ethnic (BAME) groups significantly predicted COVID-19 related death. Conclusions This is the first study within GB to assess COVID-19 related deaths in comparison to COVID-19 unrelated deaths across hospital, care homes and home combined. As an ecological study, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to individuals. However, the analysis may be informative for public health policy and protective measures. From our hypothesis-generating analysis, we propose that air pollution is a significant risk factor and high temperature a significant protective factor for COVID-19 related deaths. These factors cannot readily be modelled at an individual level. Scottish local authorities and local authorities with a higher proportion of individuals of BAME origin are potential risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths in care homes and in hospitals, respectively. Altogether, this analysis shows the benefits of access to high quality open data for public information, public health policy and further research.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Paul Leighton","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Danielle Jane Leighton","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"James Herron","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Rachel Upthegrove","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cavanagh","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Georgios Gkoutos","author_inst":"University of Birmingham & Associate Director of Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Breda Cullen","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Pavan K Mallikarjun","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"David Hougaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Michael Christiansen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Ulrik Lausten-Thomsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"David J Odde","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Ungaro","author_inst":"The Dr. Henry D.

Methods: Baseline UK Biobank data (2006-10) for England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England (16 March to 26 July 2020). Included participants were employed or self-employed at baseline, alive and aged less than 65 years in 2020. Poisson regression models adjusted sequentially for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors to assess risk ratios (RRs) for testing positive in hospital or death due to COVID-19 by three occupational classification schemes (including Standard Occupation Classification 2000). Results: Of 120,075 participants, 271 had severe COVID-19. Relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (RR 7.43, 95% CI:5.52,10.00), social and education workers (RR 1.84, 95% CI:1.21,2.82) and other essential workers (RR=1.60, 95% CI:1.05,2.45) had higher risk of severe COVID-19. Using more detailed groupings, medical support staff (RR 8.70, 95% CI:4.87,15.55), social care (RR 2.46, 95% CI:1.47,4.14) and transport workers (RR= 2.20, 95% CI:1.21,4.00) had highest risk within the broader groups. Compared to white non-essential workers, non-white non-essential workers had a higher risk (RR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.90,5.62) and non-white essential workers had the highest risk (RR 8.34, 95% CI:5.17,13.47). Using SOC2000 major groups, associate professional and technical occupations, personal service occupations and plant and machine operatives had higher risk, compared to managers and senior officials. Conclusions: Essential workers have higher risk of severe COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for national and organizational policies and practices that protect and support workers with elevated risk of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miriam Mutambudzi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Ewan B Macdonald","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Alastair H Leyland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jana J Anderson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Celis-Morales","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Cleland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Forbes","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jason MR Gill","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Mackay","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed I Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul I Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mark Curran","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Carrie Brodmerkel","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Perrigoue","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Friedman","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Eric E Schadt","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judy Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, The Dr. Henry D.

ACE2 is a major cellular-entry receptor for the COVID-19 virus. Although ACE2 is known to be expressed in many organs, whether it is expressed by the conjunctival tissue is largely unknown. Human conjunctival tissues from 68 subjects were obtained, which included 10 subjects with conjunctival nevi, 20 subjects with conjunctivitis, 9 subjects with conjunctival papilloma, 16 subjects with conjunctival cyst, 7 subjects with conjunctival polyps, and 6 ocular traumas as normal subjects. Expression of ACE2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot assay. We observed the expression of ACE2 by conjunctival tissues, expecially in conjunctival epithelial cells. ACE2 was significantly (p<0.001) overexpressed in conjunctival cells obtained from subjects with conjunctivitis, conjunctival nevi, conjunctival papilloma, conjunctival cyst, and conjunctival polyps epithelial cells when compared to that in conjunctival epithelial cells obtained from control subjects. Collectively, clinical features of reported COVID-19 patients combined with our results indicate that COVID-19 is likely to be transmitted through the conjunctiva.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"shengjie li Sr.","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"danhui li","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"jianchen fang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"qiang liu","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"xinghuai sun","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Eye & ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"gezhi xu","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Eye & ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College"},{"author_name":"wenjun cao","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Eye & ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"John Cleland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Forbes","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jason MR Gill","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Mackay","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed I Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul I Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mark Curran","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Carrie Brodmerkel","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Perrigoue","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Friedman","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Eric E Schadt","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judy Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, The Dr. Henry D.

However, accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of current evidence regarding the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings. Methods: We searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for pre-prints published prior to 05\/05\/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status. We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status, and (if available) cycle threshold values and\/or duration of viral shedding by symptom status. We computed estimates of the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect meta-analysis. Findings: We screened 270 studies and included 6. The pooled estimate for the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 11% (95% CI 4%-18%). Estimates of baseline viral load appeared to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on available data in three studies, though detailed reporting of cycle threshold values and natural history of viral shedding by symptom status was limited. Interpretation: The asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections is relatively low when estimated from methodologically-appropriate studies. Further investigation into the degree and duration of infectiousness for asymptomatic infections is warranted.

To report a comparison between fatalities and recovery of the severe Covid-19 infected patients based on demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods. Between 5 March and 12 May 2020, of 4,000 patients, 1,278 were laboratory confirmed to be Covid-19 infection in Mashhad, Iran. Finally, 334 deceased and 733 recovered cases were assessed in terms of demography, exposure history, health outcomes and clinical symptoms. Results. Mean (SD) age for confirmed patients, for deceased cases and for recovered cases. Mean (SD) age for all confirmed-patients was 56.9 (18.74), for the fatalities 67.26 (15.77) and for those recovered 52.82 (17.91) years. The rise of the mortality rate in relation to seniority was statistically significant. Despite a high frequency of Covid-19 infections accrued in the age groups of 30-39 and 40-49 years, most of these cases (88.2 and 85.8%, respectively) recovered. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalization was 9.0 (9) days. The most prevalent co-morbidities were cardiovascular disorders (21%) and diabetes (16.3%). Fever (63.8%), cough (68.1%), and dyspnoea (72.7%) were the most frequent clinical symptoms. 5.2% of infected-cases were healthcare workers that two (3%) of them died. Most patients (48%) received both antiviral and antibiotic therapy. The mortality rate of Kaletra combination prescribed for severe cases was 46.7%. Conclusions. The characteristics of Covid-19 varied from died to survived infected patients. There were a higher number of fatalities in younger patients than in international studies. Diabetes and cardiovascular disorders were most prevalent co-morbidities. The study could not address the case-fatality rate of Covid-19 infection that remains for future studies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ladan Goshayeshi","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mina Akbari Rad","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Robert Bergquist","author_inst":"Geospatial Health Journal"},{"author_name":"Abolghasem Allahyari","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"- MUMS Covid-19 Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Benyamin Hoseini","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"wenjun cao","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Eye & ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"John Cleland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Forbes","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jason MR Gill","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Mackay","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed I Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul I Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mark Curran","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Carrie Brodmerkel","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Perrigoue","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Friedman","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Eric E Schadt","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judy Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, The Dr. Henry D.

Objective To assess if the effect estimate of any intervention improves the outcomes and safety profile. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central were searched from December 1, 2019 to May 11, 2020. Study selection Any prospective\/retrospective clinical study on SARS-CoV-2 patients above 18 years of age with report on therapeutic interventions. Data synthesis and extraction Data was screened and extracted by two independent investigators. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were rates of mechanical ventilation, viral clearance, adverse events, discharge, progression to severe disease, median time for clinical recovery and anti-viral clearance. Pooled rates and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Results A total of 29 studies with 5207 participants were included in the analysis. The pooled all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 12.8% (95%CI: 8.1%-17.4%) in intervention arm. There was no significant difference in mortality between both arms overall (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.97-1.89). The mortality was significantly higher in the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group compared to control: (1.86, 95% CI: 1.38-2.50). The need for mechanical ventilation in patients with mild-moderate disease was 13.5% vs 9.8% in intervention and control groups, with no significant difference (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.60-4.15).The median duration for viral clearance in the intervention arm was 6.1 (IQR: 4.3-8.8) days and control arm was 9 (IQR: 4.5-14) days, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.37). There was no significant difference between pooled adverse event rates in intervention and control groups: 34% vs 29.5% (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.70-2.94), respectively. However, incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in HCQ sub-group (OR: 3.88, 95% CI: 1.60-9.45, I2 = 0%). There was no significant difference in other secondary outcomes. Conclusion and relevance The use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased mortality and adverse event rates. No other therapeutic intervention including Lopinavir\/Ritonavir, Remdesivir or Tocilizumab seem to alter the natural course of the disease. There is a further need for well-designed randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viveksandeep Thoguluva Chandrasekar","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bhanuprasad Venkatesalu","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, USA"},{"author_name":"Harsh K Patel","author_inst":"Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Spadaccini","author_inst":"Humanitas University and Research Hospital, Rozanno, Milan, USA"},{"author_name":"Jacob Manteuffel","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital, Michigan, Detroit, USA"},{"author_name":"Mayur S Ramesh","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"wenjun cao","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Eye & ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"John Cleland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Forbes","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jason MR Gill","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Mackay","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed I Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul I Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mark Curran","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Carrie Brodmerkel","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Perrigoue","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Friedman","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Eric E Schadt","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judy Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, The Dr. Henry D.

Evolution model considers the possibility of infections from asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized individuals. Evolution model considers the possibility that individuals who have recovered from the disease become symptomatic again. Observation model accounts for underreport of cases and deaths. Observation model accounts for delays in reporting cases and deaths. Model parameters were initially estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, by using the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro from February 28, 2020 to April 29, 2020. These estimations were used as initial input values for the solution of the state estimation problem for the city of Rio de Janeiro. Algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter was used for the solution of the state estimation problem because it allows the simultaneous estimation of state variables and model parameters. State estimation problem was solved with the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from February 28, 2020 to May 05, 2020. Monte Carlo simulations were run for 20 future days, considering uncertainties in the model parameters and state variables. Initial conditions were given by the state variables and corresponding distributions estimated with the particle filter on May 05, 2020. Distributions of the model parameters were also given by the estimations obtained for this date. Data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from May 06, 2020 to May 15, 2020, were used for the validation of the solution of the state estimation problem. The present model, with the parameters obtained with the Particle Filter, accurately fits the number of reported cases and the number of reported deaths, for 10 days ahead of the period used for the solution of the state estimation problem. The Ratio of Infected Individuals per Reported Cases was around 15 on May 05, 2020. The Indexes of Under-Reported Cases and Deaths were around 12 and 2, respectively, on May 05, 2020. The Effective Reproduction Number was around 1.6 on February 28, 2020 and dropped to around 0.9 on May 05, 2020. However, uncertainties related to this parameter are large and the effective reproduction number is between 0.3 and 1.5, at the 95% credibility level. The particle filter must be used to periodically update the estimation of state variables and model parameters, so that future predictions can be made.

However, there might be in vitro and early clinical data as well as evidence from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome that could inform clinicians and researchers. This systematic review aims to create priorities for future research of drugs repurposed for COVID-19. Methods: This systematic review will include in vitro, animal, and clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of a list of 34 specific compounds and four groups of drugs identified in a previous scoping review. Studies will be identified both from traditional literature databases and pre-print servers. Outcomes assessed will include time to clinical improvement, time to viral clearance, mortality, length of hospital stay, and proportions transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated, respectively. We will use the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence. Discussion: The challenge posed by COVID-19 requires not just a rapid review of drugs that can be repurposed but also a sustained effort to integrate new evidence into a living systematic review.

Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colin Pawlowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Karthik Murugadoss","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Liam Loscalzo","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rajiv K Pruthi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Damon E Houghton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

The underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), where is concentrated the second largest population of the country, reveals government unpreparedness, as there is a low capacity of testing in the population, which prevents the real understanding of the general panorama of Sars-Cov-2 dissemination. The goals of this research are to analyze the causes of deaths in the different Brazilian government databases (ARPEN and SINAN) and to assess whether there are sub-records shown by the unexpected increase in the frequency of deaths from causes clinically similar to COVID-19. A descriptive and quantitative analysis of the number of COVID-19 deaths and similar causes was made in different databases. Ours results demonstrate that the different official sources had a discrepancy of 209.23% between these data referring to the same period. There was also a 648.61% increase in SARS deaths in 2020, when compared to the average of previous years. Finally, it was shown that there was an increase in the rate of pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency (RI) by 5.36% and 5.72%, respectively. In conclusion, there is an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in MG due to the unexplained excess of SARS deaths, Respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia compared to previous years.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thiago Henrique Evangelista Alves","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Tafarel Andrade de Souza","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Samyla de Almeida Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Nayani Alves Ramos","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rajiv K Pruthi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Damon E Houghton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

Almost every part of the world from which the victim of COVID 19 are, have not yet been able to find out a strong way to combat corona virus. Therefore, the main aim is to minimize the spreading of the COVID-19 by detecting most of the affected people during lockdown. Hence, it is necessary to understand what the nature of growth is of spreading of this corona virus with time after almost one month (30 days) of lockdown. In this paper we have developed a very simple mathematical model to describe the growth of spreading of corona virus in human being. This model is based on realistic fact and the statistics we have so far. For controlling the spread of the COVID-19, minimization of the growth with minimum number of days of lockdown is necessary. We have established a relation between the long-term recovery coefficient and the long-term infected coefficient. The growth can be minimized if such condition satisfies. We have also discussed how the different age of the people can be cured by applying different types of medicine. We have presented the data of new cases, recovery and deaths per day to visualize the different coefficient for India and establish our theory. We have also explained how the medicine could be effective to sustain and improve such condition for country having large population like India.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Achintya Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre"},{"author_name":"Debosmita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Bidhan Nagar Sub divisional Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joy Mukherjee","author_inst":"Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre"},{"author_name":"Nayani Alves Ramos","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rajiv K Pruthi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Damon E Houghton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.
