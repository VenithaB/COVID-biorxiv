Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: England. Participants: UK Biobank comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Main outcome measure: Hospitalisation for COVID-19 in England between 16th March and 26th April 2020 as provided by Public Health England. Results: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 people. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function: verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend <=0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). Conclusion: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function was most robust to statistical adjustment.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George David Batty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Ian Deary","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michelle Luciano","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mika Kivimaki","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Catharine Gale","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20118844","rel_title":"On Reliability of the COVID-19 Forecasts","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20118844","rel_abs":"In this expository article, we are aiming to show with an example that even short term forecasts regarding the COVID-19 spread pattern may sometimes not be very reliable. We have studied data published by Worldometers.info to get numerically an approximate formula of the spread pattern for a short period. We have observed that in the United States of America, there was a nearly exponential spread pattern for a very short period from May 3 to May 8, 2020. From May 9 to May 13, the nearly exponential character of the spread was found to be absent. Hence it can be concluded that the COVID-19 spread pattern, even after more than four months from the start of the outbreak, is not quite predictable. Therefore even short term forecasts regarding the spread may not be very reliable. We have found that forecasts using the assumption of an exponential pattern of spread may actually lead to overestimation.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hemanta Kumar Baruah","author_inst":"The Assam Royal Global University"},{"author_name":"Ian Deary","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michelle Luciano","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mika Kivimaki","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Catharine Gale","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20104539","rel_title":"Pediatric COVID-19 in Southern California: clinical features and viral genetic diversity","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20104539","rel_abs":"As the pandemic enters its fifth month, information regarding COVID-19 in children is rapidly evolving.

Various hematological parameters alteration has been documented in the Chinese literature in SARS-Cov-2 infection. However, there is a need for research to evaluate the pattern of the hematological parameters of COVID-19 patients in the Indian population. Aims & Objectives: The objective of the study is to see the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), and other hematological parameters alteration of COVID-19 patients along with their clinical course in the Indian scenario. Methods: A single-center prospective study of 32 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Super Speciality Pediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute NOIDA, from March to April, were enrolled for the study. The demographic data, the clinical status of the patients during admission and follow up, baseline, and follow up hematological findings were recorded. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out, and relevant findings were presented. Results: Demographic characterization shows a mean age of 37.7 years, male (41.9%), female (58.1%)with the majority of patients are mildly symptomatic to asymptomatic(93%). The CBC values and NLR, PLR at baseline between the male and the female patients, are not showing any statistically significant difference as the 95% C.I. A statistically significant increment in the lab parameters is observed in follow-up visits. Conclusion: The majority of the patients are younger and have mild clinical presentation with female predominance. Pediatric cases have mild symptomology. Baseline CBC findings show mild neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and normal to mild thrombocytopenia. An increase in CBC parameters, NLR was noted in follow up cases. Anemia was not noted in baseline CBC and in the follow-up group. A onetime PLR is not indicative of disease progression.

The virus inoculated on plastic surface was harvested at predefined time-points and tested to evaluate viral titres on Vero cells by TCID50. Our results confirm that fomite transmission of the emerging SARS-CoV2 is possible, since the virus remains viable on surfaces up to 84 hours at both RT and JT. Moreover, a remarkable difference between the two temperatures exists, suggesting that virus vitality can be influenced by the environmental temperature. Our results support the hypothesis that in the hot season the increase of temperature could influence the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV2 and reduce Covid-19 transmission probability.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabio Magurano","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Melissa Baggieri","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Antonella Marchi","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Loredana Nicoletti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"- Covid-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Dennis T Maglinte","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Dejerianne Ostrow","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jaclyn A Biegel","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Bender","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Dien Bard","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.124107","rel_title":"Synergistic effects of anionic surfactants on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virucidal efficiency of sanitizing fluids to fight COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.124107","rel_abs":"Our surrounding environment, especially often-touched contaminated surfaces, plays an important role in the transmission of pathogens in society.

In this study, we present the effect of surfactants on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virucidal efficiency in sanitizing fluids. Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLS), and two commercial dish soap and liquid hand soap were studied with the goal of evaporation rate reduction in sanitizing liquids to maximize surface contact time. Twelve fluids with different recipes composed of ethanol, isopropanol, SDBS, SLS, glycerin, and water of standardized hardness (WSH) were tested for their evaporation time and virucidal efficiency. Evaporation time increased by 17-63% when surfactant agents were added to the liquid. In addition, surfactant incorporation enhanced the virucidal efficiency between 15-27% according to the 4-field test in the EN 16615:2015 European Standard method. Most importantly, however, we found that surfactant addition provides a synergistic effect with alcohols to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study provides a simple, yet effective solution to improve the virucidal efficiency of commonly used sanitizers.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reza Jahromi","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Vahid Mogharab","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hossein Jahromi","author_inst":"Auburn University"},{"author_name":"Arezoo Avazpour","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Azad University of Mashhad"},{"author_name":"Loredana Nicoletti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"- Covid-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Dennis T Maglinte","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Dejerianne Ostrow","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jaclyn A Biegel","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Bender","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Dien Bard","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.127829","rel_title":"Targeted Intracellular Degradation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD via Computationally-Optimized Peptide Fusions","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.127829","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has elicited a global health crisis of catastrophic proportions.

The precipitously increased death rates, its impact on livelihood and trembling economies warrant the urgent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which would be safe, efficacious and scalable. Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesised avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of Newcastle disease virus, proto-type virus of AOaV-1, was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagation in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for clinical studies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed A Rohaim","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Munir","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Fornasari","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Forest Ray","author_inst":"Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, 10032, United States"},{"author_name":"Federico M Giorgi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"David Belnap","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Michael Vershinin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Saveez Saffarian","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jaclyn A Biegel","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Bender","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Dien Bard","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.126342","rel_title":"Improved and Simplified Diagnosis of Covid-19 using TE Extraction from Dry Swabs","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.126342","rel_abs":"Rigorous testing is the way forward to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than 12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day. With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies: (i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MRS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Milad Haghani","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Michiel C.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of cardiac injury associated with higher risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether cardiac injury may have been caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes or is mainly secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Here we investigate whether human cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nMethodsInfection was induced by two strains of SARS-CoV-2 (FFM1 and FFM2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM) and in two models of human cardiac tissue.\n\nResultsWe show that SARS-CoV-2 infects hiPS-CM as demonstrated by detection of intracellular double strand viral RNA and viral spike glycoprotein protein expression. Increasing concentrations of virus RNA are detected in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in CaCo-2 cell lines documenting productive infections. SARS-COV-2 infection induced cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects and abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signaling, apoptosis and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a iPS-derived human 3D cardiosphere tissue models. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nConclusionsThe demonstration that cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro warrants the further in depth monitoring of cardiotoxic effects in COVID-19 patients.\n\nClinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is New?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis study demonstrates that human cardiac myocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LIO_LIThe study documents that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a full replicatory circle and induces a cytotoxic response in cardiomyocytes.\nC_LIO_LIInfection was confirmed in two cardiac tissue models, including living human heart slices.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the Clinical Implications?O_LIThe study may provide a rational to explain part of the cardiotoxicity observed in COVID-19 patients\nC_LIO_LIThe demonstration of direct cardiotoxicity induced by SARS-CoV-2 warrants an in depth further analysis of cardiac tissue of COVID-19 patients and a close monitoring for putative direct cardiomyocyte injury.\nC_LIO_LIThe established models can be used to test novel therapeutic approaches targeting COVID-19.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Julian Wagner","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Mariana Shumliakivska","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Galip Aslan","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Umber Saleem","author_inst":"UKE Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Arne Hansen","author_inst":"UKE Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Luxan","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Stefan Guenther","author_inst":"MPI Heart and Lung Research"},{"author_name":"Minh Duc Pham","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Jaya Krishnan","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Patrick Harter","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Utz Ermel","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Achilleas S Frangakis","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Andreas Zeiher","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Milting","author_inst":"Clinic for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Bad Oyenhausen"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Andreas Dendorfer","author_inst":"Walter-Brendel-Centre, Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"},{"author_name":"Thomas Eschenhagen","author_inst":"UKE Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Goethe Universtiy Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Dimmeler","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.123810","rel_title":"Dose-dependent response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the ferret model: evidence of protection to re-challenge","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.123810","rel_abs":"In December 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was subsequently identified and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which rapidly spread worldwide causing a pandemic. Currently there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available against SARS-CoV-2 but numerous candidate vaccines are in development and repurposed drugs are being tested in the clinic. There is a vital need for authentic COVID-19 animal models to further our understanding of pathogenesis and viral spread in addition to pre-clinical evaluation of candidate interventions.\n\nHere we report a dose titration study of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the most suitable infectious dose to use in the ferret model. We show that a high (5x106 pfu) and medium (5x104 pfu) dose of SARS-CoV-2 induces consistent upper respiratory tract (URT) viral RNA shedding in both groups of six challenged animals, whilst a low dose (5x102 pfu) resulted in only one of six displaying signs of URT viral RNA replication. The URT shedding lasted up to 21 days in the high dose animals with intermittent positive signal from day 14. Sequential culls revealed distinct pathological signs of mild multifocal bronchopneumonia in approximately 5-15% of the lung, observed on day 3 in high and medium dosed animals, with presence of mild broncho-interstitial pneumonia on day 7 onwards. No obvious elevated temperature or signs of coughing or dyspnoea were observed although animals did present with a consistent post-viral fatigue lasting from day 9-14 in the medium and high dose groups. After virus shedding ceased, re-challenged ferrets were shown to be fully protected from acute lung pathology. The endpoints of URT viral RNA replication in addition to distinct lung pathology and post viral fatigue were observed most consistently in the high dose group. This ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a mild clinical disease (as displayed by 80% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2). In addition, intermittent viral shedding on days 14-21 parallel observations reported in a minority of clinical cases.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathryn A

world health and its economy. Its main protease (Mpro), which functions as a dimer, cleaves viral precursor proteins in the process of viral maturation. It is a good candidate for drug development owing to its conservation and the absence of a human homolog. An improved understanding of the protein behaviour can accelerate the discovery of effective therapies in order to reduce mortality. 100 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of 50 homology modelled mutant Mpro dimers were performed at pH 7 from filtered sequences obtained from the GISAID database. Protease dynamics were analysed using RMSD, RMSF, Rg, the averaged betweenness centrality and geometry calculations. Domains from each Mpro protomer were found to generally have independent motions, while the dimer-stabilising N-finger region was found to be flexible in most mutants. A mirrored interprotomer pocket was found to be correlated to the catalytic site using compaction dynamics, and can be a potential allosteric target. The high number of titratable amino acids of Mpro may indicate an important role of pH on enzyme dynamics, as previously reported for SARS-CoV. Independent coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations suggest a link between rigidity\/mutability and enzymatic function.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olivier Sheik

The objective of this study to assess the prevention knowledge and practices towards the COVID-19 among the residents of Ethiopia.Methods An online cross-sectional study was conducted among the sample of Ethiopian residents via social platforms of the author\u2019s network with the popular media such as Facebook, in Ethiopia from the April 15-22, 2020 and successfully recruited 341 responses. The snowball sampling was employed to recruit the participants. The data were analyzed using STATA version 14. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the level of knowledge and practices.Results The majority of the respondents (80.35%) were male. The overall prevention knowledge of the participants towards the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was high. About 91.2% of the participant was heard about the novel coronavirus disease and Social Medias\u2019 were the main source of the information. About 90% of the participants had a good prevention knowledge of maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing. The practices of the participants towards the COVID-19 prevention were very low. Out of 341 participants, only 61% and 84% of the participants were practicing social distance and frequent hand washing, respectively.Conclusions Majority of the participants had knew the ways of protecting themselves from the novel coronavirus. But, there was deficiencies of changing these prevention knowledge to practice. This indicates that there was gap between knowledge and implementation of prevention strategies in the community. The concerned body should focus on providing education for the community regarding the implementation of the prevention knowledge to practice.AbbreviationsFFNCFamily, friends, neighbor, and

COVID-19. The evolutionary trend of the virus genome may have implications for infection control policy but remains obscure. We introduce an estimation of fold change of translational efficiency based on synonymous variant sites to characterize the adaptation of the virus to hosts. The increased translational efficiency of the M and N genes suggests that the population of SARS-CoV-2 benefits from mutations toward favored codons, while the ORF1ab gene has slightly decreased the translational efficiency. In the coding region of the ORF1ab gene upstream of the -1 frameshift site, the decreasing of the translational efficiency has been weakening parallel to the growth of the epidemic, indicating inhibition of synthesis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotion of replication of the genome. Such an evolutionary trend suggests that multiple infections increased virulence in the absence of social distancing.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel

users to acquire glycoproteomics data. Complex glycans, however, add a dimension of complexity to the data analysis workflow. In a sense, complex glycans are post-translationally modified post-translational modifications, reflecting a series of biosynthetic reactions in the secretory pathway that are spatially and temporally regulated. One problem is that complex glycan is micro-heterogeneous, multiplying the complexity of the proteome. Another is that glycopeptide glycans undergo dissociation during tandem MS that must be considered for tandem MS interpretation algorithms and quantitative tools. Fortunately, there are a number of algorithmic tools available for analysis of glycoproteomics LC-MS data. We summarize the principles for glycopeptide data analysis and show use of our GlycReSoft tool to analyze SARS-CoV-2 spike protein site-specific glycosylation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua A.

including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. We used a Bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that host-switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha-than beta-CoVs, and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice

global pandemic. The availability of genomes in the public domain following the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus across the globe. The availability of whole genomes from multiple states in India prompted us to analyse the phylogenetic clusters of genomes in India. We performed whole-genome sequencing for 64 genomes making a total of 361 genomes from India, followed by phylogenetic clustering, substitution analysis, and dating of the different phylogenetic clusters of viral genomes. We describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster (Clade I \/ A3i) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India, which encompasses 41% of all genomes sequenced and deposited in the public domain from multiple states in India. Globally 3.5% of genomes, which till date could not be mapped to any distinct known cluster fall in this newly defined clade. The cluster is characterized by a core set of shared genetic variants - C6312A (T2016K), C13730T (A88V\/A97V), C23929T, and C28311T (P13L). Further, the cluster is also characterized by a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.4 x 10-3 variants per site per year, lower than the prevalent A2a cluster, and predominantly driven by variants in the E and N genes and relative sparing of the S gene. Epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged in the month of February 2020 and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by countrywide spread, as evidenced by the low divergence of the genomes from across the country. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study characterizing the distinct and predominant cluster of SARS-CoV-2 in India.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sofia Banu","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Bani Jolly","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of

Health Organization, only three months after the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. Early clinical care mainly focused on respiratory illnesses. However, a variety of neurological manifestations in both adults and newborns are also emerging. To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could target the human brain, we infected iPSC-derived human brain organoids. Our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect and kill neural cells, including cortical neurons. This phenotype was accompanied by impaired synaptogenesis. Finally, Sofosbuvir, an FDA-approved antiviral drug, was able to rescue these alterations. Given that there are currently no vaccine or antiviral treatments available, urgent therapies are needed. Our findings put Sofosbuvir forward as a potential treatment to alleviate COVID-19-related neurological symptoms.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 infection causes neuronal death and impaired

of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death are still unclear for Covid-19 and only a few studies have adjusted for confounding for different clinical outcomes including all reported cases in a country in the analysis. We used routine surveillance data from Portugal to identify risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, in order to support risk stratification, clinical and public health interventions, and to improve scenarios to plan health care resources. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 20,293 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Portugal to 28 April 2020, electronically through the National Epidemic Surveillance System of the Directorate-General of Health(DGS). We calculated absolute risks, relative risks (RR) and adjusted relative risks (aRR) to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with hospitalization, admission to ICU and death using Poisson regressions. Results Increasing age after 60 years was the greatest determinant for all outcomes. Assuming 0-50 years as reference, being aged 80-89 years was the strongest determinant of hospital admission (aRR-5.7), 70-79 years for ICU(aRR-10.4) and >90 years for death(aRR-226.8) with an aRR of 112.7 in those 70-79 . Among comorbidites, Immunodeficiency, cardiac disease, kidney disease, and neurologic disease were independent risk factors for hospitalization (aRR 1.83, 1.79, 1.56, 1.82), for ICU these were cardiac, Immunodeficiency, kidney and lung disease (aRR 4.33, 2.76, 2.43, 2.04), and for death they were kidney, cardiac and chronic neurological disease (aRR: 2.9, 2.6, 2.0) Male gender was a risk factor for all outcomes. There were statistically significant differences for the 3 outcomes between regions. Discussion and Conclusions Older age stands out as the strongest risk factor for all outcomes specially for death as absolute is risk was small for those younger than 50. These findings have implications in terms of risk stratified public health measures that should prioritize protecting older people. Epidemiologic scenarios and clinical guidelines may consider the estimated risks, even though under-ascertainment of mild and asymptomatic cases should be considered in different age groups.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasco Ricoca Peixoto","author_inst":"National School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andre Vieira","author_inst":"NOVA National School of

We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine the prevalence of specific health conditions associated with complications from COVID-19 and to calculate, for each individual, an index of the risk of severe complications from respiratory infections developed by DeCaprio et al. (2020). We show large disparities across race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the prevalence of conditions which are associated with the risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Moreover, we show that these disparities emerge early in life, prior to age 65, leading to higher vulnerability to such complications. While vulnerability is highest among older adults regardless of their race-ethnicity or socioeconomic status, our results suggest particular attention should also be given to the risk of adverse outcomes in midlife for non-Hispanic Blacks, adults with a high school degree or less, and low-income Americans.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily E.

avoid the contagion and its spread. These measures are known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and their implementation clearly produces social unrest as well as greatly affects the economy. Frequently, NPIs are implemented with an intensity quantified in an ad hoc manner. Control theory offers a worthwhile tool for determining the optimal intensity of the NPIs in order to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system while keeping them as low as possible, yielding in a policymakers concrete guidance.

However, such models leave a scale-gap between the spatial resolution of actionable information (i.e. the county or city level) and that of modeled viral spread. States and nations are not spatially homogeneous and different areas may vary in disease risk and severity. For example, COVID-19 has age-stratified risk. Similarly, ICU units, PPE and other vital equipment are not equally distributed within states. Here, we implement a county-level epidemiological framework to assess and forecast COVID-19 spread through Georgia, where 1,933 people have died from COVID-19 and 44,638 cases have been documented as of May 27, 2020. We find that county-level forecasts trained on heterogeneity due to clustered events can continue to predict epidemic spread over multi-week periods, potentially serving efforts to prepare medical resources, manage supply chains, and develop targeted public health interventions. We find that the premature removal of physical (social) distancing could lead to rapid increases in cases or the emergence of sustained plateaus of elevated fatalities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen J Beckett","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marian Dominguez-Mirazo","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Seolha Lee","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Clio Andris","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Judith A.

number of confirmed cases and deaths in Brazil due to COVID-19 hit 233,142 and 15,633, respectively, making the country one of the most affected by the pandemic. The State of Sao Paulo (SSP) hosts the largest number of confirmed cases in Brazil, with over 60,000 cases to date. Here we investigate the spatial distribution and spreading patterns of COVID-19 in the SSP by mapping the spatial autocorrelation and the clustering patterns of the virus in relation to the population density and the number of hospital beds. Moran's I and LISA clustering analysis indicated that Sao Paulo City is a significant hotspot for both the confirmed cases and deaths, whereas other cities across the State could be considered colder spots. Bivariate Moran's I also showed that the population density is a key indicator for the number of deaths, whereas the number of hospital beds is less related, implying that the fatality depends substantially on the actual patient's condition. Social isolation measures throughout the SSP have been gradually increasing since early March, an action that helped to slow down the emergence of the new confirmed cases, highlighting the importance of the safe-distancing measures in mitigating the local transmission within and between cities in the SSP.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enner Alcantara","author_inst":"Sao Paulo

costs deriving from the adoption of the CoViD-19 epidemic management strategy. For this purpose, we developed a specific methodology that combines an epidemiological model, known in the literature as \"SIR\" (Susceptible - Infected - Recovered), and a probabilistic state model, also known as \"multi-state\". The model thus conceived was then parameterized using the dataset published by the Italian Government through the Civil Protection and the Istituto Superiore di Sanita. We therefore estimated the duration of the disease and the related costs, with reference to the strategy currently under discussion between government institutions and social organizations involved. Given the flexibility of the adopted approach, the tool will also be able to provide useful indications in relation to any alternative strategies that the Government could adopt in the near future, as well as being the starting point of an analysis of the epidemic indirect costs such as losses of GDP fractions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabio Verachi","author_inst":"Intesa

We use a process model based on a compartmental epidemiological framework Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD). Analysis of case data with such a mechanism-based model has advantages over purely phenomenological approaches because the parameters of the SIRD model can be calibrated using prior knowledge. This approach can be used to investigate how governmental interventions have affected the Covid-19-related transmission and mortality rate during the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhijit Chakraborty","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Josefstaedter Strasse 39, 1080 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Jiaying Chen","author_inst":"Section for Science of Complex Systems, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Amelie Desvars-Larrive","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna"},{"author_name":"Peter Klimek","author_inst":"Section for Science of Complex Systems, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Erwin Flores Tames","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Josefstaedter Strasse 39, 1080 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"David Garcia","author_inst":"Section for Science of Complex Systems, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Leonhard Horstmeyer","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Josefstaedter Strasse 39, 1080 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Michaela Kaleta","author_inst":"Section for Science of Complex Systems, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Jana Lasser","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Josefstaedter Strasse 39, 1080 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Jenny Reddish","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Josefstaedter Strasse 39, 1080 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Beate Pinior","author_inst":"Unit of Veterinary Public Health and Epidemiology, Institute of Food Safety, Food Technology and Veterinary Public Health, University of Veterinary Medicine, 12"},{"author_name":"Johannes Wachs","author_inst":"Vienna University of Economics and Business, Institute for Information Business.
