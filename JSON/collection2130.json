However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the burden of the disease in patients with asthma has been less evident. Objective: This study aims at a better understanding of the burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma and the impact of asthma, its related comorbidities, and treatment on the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1st to May 10th, 2020 using big data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform. Results: Out of 71,192 patients with asthma, 1,006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 vs. 42 years), predominantly female (66% vs. 59%), had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and obesity, and smoked more frequently. Contrarily, allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less frequent in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (P < .001). Higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity was also confirmed in those patients with asthma and COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The percentage of individuals using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalized patients (48.3% vs. 61.5%; OR: 0.58: 95% CI 0.44-0.77). During the study period, 865 (1.21%) patients with asthma were being treated with biologics. Although these patients showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) level, their hospital admission rates due to COVID-19 were relatively low (0.23%). COVID-19 increased inpatient mortality in asthmatic patients (2.29% vs 0.54%; OR 2.29: 95% CI 4.35-6.66). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases in patients with asthma has been low, although higher than the observed in the general population. Patients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and were at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors. ICS and biologics are generally safe and may be associated with a protective effect against severe COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Luis Izquierdo","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine.

This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS. Methods The epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared. Results The UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19+ve cohort (7\/13, 54% vs 5\/22, 23% in COVID negative) thought to be related directly to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Conclusions This study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS. GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic which may be the influence of lockdown measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and respiratory viruses.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Keddie","author_inst":"1.

more than 1,000 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals have thus far been collected in the GEN-COVID Biobank (GCB). Sample types include whole blood, plasma, serum, leukocytes, and DNA. The GCB links samples to detailed clinical data available in the GEN-COVID Patient Registry (GCPR). It includes hospitalized patients (74.25%), broken down into intubated, treated by CPAP-biPAP, treated with O2 supplementation, and without respiratory support (9.5%, 18.4%, 31.55% and 14.8, respectively); and non-hospitalized subjects (25.75%), either pauci- or asymptomatic. More than 150 clinical patient-level data fields have been collected and binarized according to the organs\/systems primarily affected by COVID-19: heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, chemosensors, innate or adaptive immunity, and clotting system, for further statistics. Hierarchical Clustering analysis identified five main clinical categories: i) severe multisystemic failure with either thromboembolic or pancreatic variant; ii) cytokine storm type either severe with liver involvement or moderate; iii) moderate heart type either with or without liver damage; iv) moderate multisystemic involvement either with or without liver damage; v) mild either with or without hyposmia. GCB and GCPR are further linked to the GEN-COVID Genetic Data Repository (GCGDR), which includes data from Whole Exome Sequencing and high-density SNP genotyping. The data are available for sharing through the Network for Italian Genomes, within the COVID-19 dedicated section. The study objective is to systematize this comprehensive data collection and start identifying multi-organ involvement in COVID-19, defining genetic parameters for infection susceptibility within the population, and mapping genetically COVID-19 severity and clinical complexity among patients.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Daga","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Fallerini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Margherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Fava","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Floriana Valentino","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Doddato","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Benetti","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Amitrano","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mirella Bruttini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Meloni","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Pinto","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Raimondi","author_inst":"Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Stella","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Biscarini","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Picchiotti","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM- SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Department of Mathematics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Gori","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM - SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Universite Cote d Azur, Inria, CNRS, I3S, Maasai"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanarico","author_inst":"Independent Data Scientist, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francis P.

I find several important results. First, holding mobility fixed, temperature is found to have a negative and significant effect on COVID-19 cases from 1 to 8 weeks ahead and on deaths from 2 to 8 weeks ahead. Second, holding weather fixed, mobility is found to have a large positive effect on subsequent growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The impact on cases becomes significant 3 to 4 weeks ahead and continues through 8 to 10 weeks ahead. The impact on deaths becomes significant around 4 weeks ahead and persists for at least 10 weeks. Third, I find that the deleterious effects of mobility on COVID-19 outcomes are far greater when the local virus transmission rate is above one -- evidence supportive of public health policies aiming to reduce mobility specifically in places experiencing high transmission rates while relaxing restrictions elsewhere. Fourth, I find that the dynamic effects of mobility on cases are generally similar across counties, but the effects on deaths are higher for counties with older populations and, surprisingly, counties with lower black or hispanic population shares. Lastly, I find that while the marginal impact of mobility changes has been stable over recent weeks for cases, it has come down for deaths.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel John Wilson","author_inst":"Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chiara Fallerini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Margherita Baldassarri","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Fava","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Floriana Valentino","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Doddato","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Benetti","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Amitrano","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mirella Bruttini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Meloni","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Pinto","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Raimondi","author_inst":"Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Stella","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Biscarini","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Picchiotti","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM- SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Department of Mathematics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Gori","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM - SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Universite Cote d Azur, Inria, CNRS, I3S, Maasai"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanarico","author_inst":"Independent Data Scientist, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francis P.

Integration has also been highlighted as a critical element for building resilient health systems that can stand the shock of health emergencies. However, there is dearth of research and systematic synthesis of evidence on the synergistic relationship between integrated health services and pandemic preparedness in low- and low-middle income countries (LMICs). Thus, the authors are organizing a scoping review aiming to explore application of integrated health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. Methods and analysis This scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and OMalley (2005). Peer reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled utilizing a standardized and replicable search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, the World Health Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19, and LitCovid. Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full text review by two independent reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with accompanying data matrices. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June to December 2020. Results from this study will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will be developed into reports and a peer-reviewed articles and will assist policy makers in making pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic response.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Neill","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Md Zabir Hasan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Das","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vasuki Venugopal","author_inst":"Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Nishant Jain","author_inst":"Indo-German Social Security Program, GIZ India, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Dinesh Arora","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shivam Gupta","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Simone Furini","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rossella Tita","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Amitrano","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mirella Bruttini","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy; Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Meloni","author_inst":"Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Pinto","author_inst":"Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Senese, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Raimondi","author_inst":"Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Stella","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Filippo Biscarini","author_inst":"CNR-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria  (IBBA), Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Picchiotti","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM- SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Department of Mathematics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Gori","author_inst":"University of Siena, DIISM - SAILAB, Siena, Italy; Universite Cote d Azur, Inria, CNRS, I3S, Maasai"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, \tMilano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanarico","author_inst":"Independent Data Scientist, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francis P.

Here I illustrate the relationship between these two extreme scenarios, exponential and power law growth, based on the impact of superspreaders and lockdown strategies to contain the outbreak.

The methodology is shown to be flexible enough to capture multi-class interaction in epidemic propagation in which multiple authorities are risk-aware atomic decision-makers and individuals are risk-aware non-atomic decision-makers. Based on MASS, we present a data-driven modelling and analytics for mitigating Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The model integrates untested cases, age-structure, decision-making, gender, pre-existing health conditions, location, testing capacity, hospital capacity, mobility map on local areas, in-city, inter-cities, and international. It shown that the data-driven model can capture most of the reported data on COVID-19 on confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, number of testing and number of active cases in 66+ countries.

Robust estimates of key time-to-event distributions remain scarce as well. Methods We collected individual records for 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 contacts identified by contact tracing and monitoring over the period from January 13 to April 02, 2020 in Hunan Province, China. We provide descriptive statistics of the characteristics of cases and their close contacts; we fitted distributions to time-to-key-events distributions and infectiousness profile over time; and we used generalized linear mixed model to estimate risk factors for susceptibility and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Results We estimated the mean serial interval at 5.5 days (95%CI -5.0, 19.9) and the mean generation time at 5.5 days (95%CI 1.7, 11.6). The infectiousness was estimated to peak 1.8 days before symptom onset, with 95% of transmission events occurring between 7.6 days before and 7.3 days after the date of symptom onset. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated to be 62.5%. We estimated that at least 3.5% of cases were generated asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility was not significantly different between working-age adults (15-59 years old) and other age groups (0-14 years old: p-value=0.16; 60 years and over: p-value=0.33), whilst susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated to increase with age (p-value=0.03). In addition, transmission risk was higher for household contacts (p-value<0.001), decreased for higher generations within a cluster (second generation: odds ratio=0.13, p-value<0.001; generations 3-4: odds ratio=0.05, p-value<0.001, relative to generation 1), and decreased for infectors with a larger number of contacts (p-value=0.04). Interpretation Our findings warn of the possible relevant contribution of children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. When lockdown interventions are in place, we found that odds of transmission are highest in the household setting but, with the relaxation of interventions, other settings (including schools) could bear a higher risk of transmission.

Methods We compared five testing strategies: 1) PCR-severe-only: PCR testing only patients with severe\/critical symptoms; 2) Self-screen: PCR-severe-only plus self-assessment of COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 3) PCR-any-symptom: PCR for any COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 4) PCR-all: PCR-any-symptom and one-time PCR for the entire population; and, 5) PCR-all-repeat: PCR-all with monthly re-testing. We examined effective reproduction numbers (Re, 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity\/specificity (70\/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, $\/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). Results In all scenarios, PCR-all-repeat would lead to the best clinical outcomes and PCR-severe-only would lead to the worst; at Re 0.9, PCR-all-repeat vs. PCR-severe-only resulted in a 63% reduction in infections and a 44% reduction in deaths, but required >65-fold more tests\/day with 4-fold higher costs. PCR-all-repeat had an ICER <$100,000\/QALY only when Re[&ge;]1.8. At all Re values, PCR-any-symptom was cost-saving compared to other strategies. Conclusions Testing people with any COVID-19-consistent symptoms would be cost-saving compared to restricting testing to only those with symptoms severe enough to warrant hospital care. Expanding PCR testing to asymptomatic people would decrease infections, deaths, and hospitalizations. Universal screening would be cost-effective when paired with monthly retesting in settings where the COVID-19 pandemic is surging.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne M Neilan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Losina","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Audrey C.

The estimated IFR is close to zero for younger adults but rises exponentially with age, reaching about 0.3% for ages 50-59, 1.3% for ages 60-69, 4% for ages 70-79, 10% for ages 80-89. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 is not just dangerous for the elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle-aged adults. Consequently, the overall IFR for a given location is intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections, and hence protecting vulnerable age groups could substantially reduce the incidence of mortality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew T Levin","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Nana Owusu-Boaitey","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kensington B.

Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possibly non-linear influences remain unknown. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th, were analyzed. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate and exploit the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. Results A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile ranges [IQR] 38 - 55, range 16 - 60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe\/critical disease course and the mean age was significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of ASS, CRP and LDH, and decreased lymphocyte counts are influential on disease severity independent of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41-122.3; p=0.039) are particularly associated with the risk for the development of severity specifically in young patients, where no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. Conclusion In young patients with COVID-19, the levels of complement C3 correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weiting Cheng Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan No.1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roman Hornung","author_inst":"Ludwig-Maximillian-University Munchen Institute of Medical Information, Biometry and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Kai Xu","author_inst":"Tongji hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"Ludwig-Maximilian-Univeristy Munchen Institute of Medical Information, Biometry and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Seamus P.

SARS-CoV-2 follows a highly variable course and it is becoming more evident that individuals immune system has a decisive influence on the progression of the disease. However, the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 mediate disease pathogenesis are largely unknown. Only a few host transcriptional responses in COVID-19 have been reported so far from the Western world, but no such data has been generated from the South-Asian region yet to correlate the conjectured lower fatality around this part of the globe. In this context, we aimed to perform the transcriptomic profiling of the COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh along with the reporting of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from these patients. Moreover, we performed a comparative analysis to demonstrate how differently the various SARS-CoV-2 infection systems are responding to the viral pathogen. We detected a unique missense mutation at 10329 position of ORF1ab gene, annotated to 3C like proteinase, which is found in 75% of our analyzed isolates; but is very rare globally. Upon the functional enrichment analyses of differentially modulated genes, we detected a similar host induced response reported earlier; this response was mainly mediated by the innate immune system, interferon stimulation, and upregulated cytokine expression etc. in the Bangladeshi patients. Surprisingly, we did not perceive the induction of apoptotic signaling, phagosome formation, antigen presentation and production, hypoxia response within these nasopharyngeal samples. Furthermore, while comparing with the other SARS-CoV-2 infection systems, we spotted that lung cells trigger the more versatile immune and cytokine signaling which was several folds higher compared to our reported nasopharyngeal samples. We also observed that lung cells did not express ACE2 in a very high amount as suspected, however, the nasopharyngeal cells are found overexpressing ACE2. But the amount of DPP4 expression within the nasal samples was significantly lower compared to the other cell types. Surprisingly, we observed that lung cells express a very high amount of integrins compared to the nasopharyngeal samples, which might suggest the putative reasons for an increased amount of viral infections in the lungs. From the network analysis, we got clues on the probable viral modulation for the overexpression of these integrins. Our data will provide valuable insights in developing potential studies to elucidate the roles of ethnicity effect on the viral pathogenesis, and incorporation of further data will enrich the search of an effective therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abul B.M.M.K.

Serological assays may improve disease management when appropriately used, for better understanding the antibody responses mounted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impratical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. Aim: we evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Methods: both IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called Maglumi 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical EngineeringCo., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China) Results: A total of 8285 health care workers were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% women and 5% men, but the difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all severe COVID-19 patients (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion: Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study has the statistical power to define precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of health workers in our region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"university of padova"},{"author_name":"Ugo Fedeli","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione Veneto"},{"author_name":"Elena Schievano","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione Veneto"},{"author_name":"Elena Vecchiato","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione veneto"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"Universita di Verona"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Lo Cascio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Verona"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Components of such a strategy include individuals tested because they self-select or are recommended for testing by a health care provider for their own health care; individuals tested because they belong to a high-risk group where testing serves to disrupt transmission; and, finally, individuals randomly selected for testing from the university community population as part of a proactive community testing, or surveillance, program. The proactive community testing program is predicated on a mobile device application that asks individuals to self-monitor COVID-like symptoms daily. The goals of this report are (i) to provide a framework for estimating prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the university community wherein proactive community testing is a major component of the overall strategy, (ii) to address the issue of how many tests should be performed as part of the proactive community testing program, and (iii) to consider how effective proactive community testing will be for purposes of detection of new disease clusters. We argue that a comprehensive prevalence estimate informed by all testing done of the university community is a good metric to obtain a global picture of campus SARS-CoV-2 infection rates at a particular point in time and to monitor the dynamics of infection over time, for example, estimating the population-level reproductive number, R0). Importantly, the prevalence metric can be useful to campus leadership for decision making. One example involves comparing campus prevalence to that in the broader off-campus community. We also show that under some reasonable assumptions, we can obtain valid statements about the comprehensive prevalence by only testing symptomatic persons in the proactive community testing component. The number of tests performed for individual-level and high-risk group-level needs will depend on the disease dynamics, individual needs, and testing availability. For purposes of this report, we assume that, for these groups of individuals, inferential precision --- that is, the accuracy with which we can estimate the true prevalence from testing a random sample of individuals --- does not drive decisions on the number of tests. On the other hand, for proactive community testing, the desired level of inferential precision {in a fixed period of time can be used to justify the number of tests to perform {in that period. For example, our results show that, if we establish a goal of ruling out with 98\\% confidence a background prevalence of 2\\% {in a given week, and the actual prevalence is 1\\% among those eligible for proactive community testing, we would need to test 835 randomly-selected symptomatics (i.e., those presenting with COVID-like symptoms) per week via the proactive community testing program in a campus of 80k individuals. In addition to justifying decisions about the number of tests to perform, inferential precision can formalize the intuition that testing of symptomatic individuals should be prioritized over testing asymptomatic individuals in the proactive community testing program.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul J Rathouz","author_inst":"U of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Calder","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"George Barbastathis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elena Schievano","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione Veneto"},{"author_name":"Elena Vecchiato","author_inst":"Azienda Zero, regione veneto"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"Universita di Verona"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Lo Cascio","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Verona"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

These deaths are widely attributed directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic. This surge in death necessitates a matched health system response to relieve serious health related suffering at the end of life (EoL) and achieve a dignified death, through timely and appropriate expertise, medication and equipment. Identifying the human and material resource needed relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Methods A Discrete Event Simulation model designed in collaboration with health service funders, health providers, clinicians and modellers in the South West of England was created to estimate the resources required during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for deaths from COVID-19 in the community for a geographical area of nearly 1 million people. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. Results The model predicts that a mean of 11.97 hours (0.18 hours Standard Error (SE), up to a max of 28 hours) of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time (mean 9.17 hours, 0.23 hours SE), and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night-sits (mean of 5.74 hours per day, 0.22 hours SE) will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day (mean of 9.32 hours per day, 0.12 hours SE). An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles or \"just in case\" prescriptions per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles (0.06 SE) of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps (0.11 SE) could be needed to be in use per day (between 1 and 20 syringe pumps). Conclusion Modelling provides essential data to prepare, plan and deliver a palliative care pandemic response tailored to local work patterns and resource. The analysis for a large region in the South West of England shows the significant additional physical and human resource required to relieve suffering at the EoL as part of a pandemic response.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Chalk","author_inst":"University of Exeter Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sara Robbins","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rohan Kandasamy","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kate Rush","author_inst":"Sirona Care and Health"},{"author_name":"Ajay Aggarwal","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

The Ministry of Public Health in Qatar has developed an emergency action plan to respond to the outbreak with the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) as a main component of that response. Aim: The aim of this review is to understand and document the Impact of COVID 19 on PHCC in Qatar in terms of response, modifications of services and introduction of new alternatives Methodology: A retrospective data analysis was conducted for all the COVID-19 swabbing activities and for all the utilization services volume across the PHCC health centers between January 2018 and May 2020. Results: PHCC allocated testing sites for COVID-19 resulted in conducting 54824 swabs with 11455 positive cases and positivity rate of 20.8% between 14th of March and 15th of June 2020. The overall PHCC services utilization declined with overall reduction of 50% in April 2020. Alternative virtual and remote services were provided, telemedicine was introduced, and it made up 50% of the consultation volumes for April 2020. Home refill delivery medications managed to provide a total of 20920 delivered prescriptions by end of May 2020. Conclusion and recommendations: To decrease the risk of infection to the patients and health care workers, PHCC in Qatar cancelled the appointments for some high-risk population. However, PHCC introduced virtual remote services that managed to make up for the in-person utilization volume and reflected acceptance in patients behaviours. PHCC continued in detecting positive COVID-19 cases among its targeted communities. keywords: COVID-19, Qatar, Primary care, Service Utilization, Teleconsultation","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mariam Abdulmalik","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Samya Al Abdulla","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Haj Bakri","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"John Gibb","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

We assessed anxiety using general anxiety disorder (GAD) scale and assessed participants risk perceptions regarding severity of the outbreak. Of the 1,017 participants, 23% reported moderate to severe anxiety (GAD score above 10). A high proportion reported perceived likelihood of ICU admission (46%) and death (30%) upon getting COVID-19. Results from path analysis showed that younger participants, those with chronic conditions, those living with children and low perceived trust in government response to COVID-19 had a significantly higher anxiety mediated by their perceived risk of dying upon getting COVID-19. These results highlight the need for management of anxiety through adequate and effective risk communication for the general public.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chetna Malhotra","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Isha Chaudhry","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Semra Ozdemir","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Irene Teo","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Eric A Finkelstein","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Methods: Systematic review of randomised trials that compared a community-based hand hygiene intervention (soap and water, or sanitiser) with a control, or trials that compared sanitiser with soap and water, and measured outcomes of ARI, ILI, or laboratory-confirmed influenza or related consequences. Searches were conducted in CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and trial registries (April 2020) and data extraction completed by independent pairs of reviewers. Results: Eighteen trials were included. When meta-analysed, three trials of soap and water versus control found a non-significant increase in ARI events (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.23, 95%CI 0.78-1.93); six trials of sanitiser versus control found a significant reduction in ARI events (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.71-0.89). When hand hygiene dose was plotted against ARI relative risk, no clear dose-response relationship was observable. Four trials were head-to-head comparisons of sanitiser and soap and water but too heterogeneous to pool: two found a significantly greater reduction in the sanitiser group compared to the soap group; two found no significant difference between the intervention arms. Conclusion: Adequately performed hand hygiene, with either soap or sanitiser, reduces the risk of ARI virus transmission, however direct and indirect evidence suggest sanitiser might be more effective in practice.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffmann","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mina Bakhit","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Natalia Krzyzaniak","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Anna Scott","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Here, the co-expression network was constructed by mapping the well-known ACE2, TMPRSS2 and host susceptibility genes implicated in COVID-19 GWAS onto a cornea, retinal pigment epithelium and lung. We found a significant co-expression module of these genes in the cornea, revealing that cornea is potential extra-respiratory entry portal of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, both co-expression and interaction networks show a significant enrichment in mitochondrial function, which are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis, inflammation and innate immune response. We identified a corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of 14 mitochondrial genes by integrating ACE2 co-expression cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Gene ECSIT, as a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, exhibits the strongest correlation with ACE2 in CMSM, which has shown to be an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Our co-expression and protein interaction network analysis uncover that the mitochondrial function related genes in cornea contribute to the dissection of COVID-19 susceptibility and potential therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jian Yuan","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"dandan Fan","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengbo Xue","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

The purpose of this research is to develop an epidemi- ological model that allow to estimate the number of unknown\/asymptomatic cases in a given area. The SEIAMPR system, a novel simulation based model for COVID-19 is designed and implemented in Python. The intuition of the model is simple: about 80% of COVID-19 infected people evolve as asymptomatic or with a mild clinical course, many of them remain unknown to the authorities, some of them including those in critical conditions are eventually detected and classified as positive cases. The simulator reproduces this process using an adaptive method integrated with official data. The simulator has been used for modelling the outbreak in 21 regions in Italy. The positive effects of lockdown policies are demonstrated: unknown ac- tive cases 12 days after the lockdown (March the 21th) ranged from 284101 to 374038, e.g. many more than all the official cases in Italy, reducing to 10213\/20949 the reopening day. The number of unknown active cases at the beginning of June in the Lombardia region ranged from 6813 to 13390 de- manding particular attention. SEIAMPR is simple to tune and integrate with official data, it emerges as an up-and-coming tool for reporting the effect of lockdown measures, the impact of the disease on the population, and the remaining unknown active cases for evaluating the timing of exit strategies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mauro Gaspari","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"dandan Fan","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhengbo Xue","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University Eye Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Chamberlain","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefano Porru","author_inst":"Universita di verona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Palu","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Milton C.

Design: Cross-sectional e-survey study. Setting: African countries Participants: Cardiologists Primary and Secondary outcomes measures: The primary outcome was the change in service delivery in African cardiology units during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcomes were the satisfaction of cardiologists with regards to the workload and factors associated with this satisfaction. Results: There was a significant reduction in working time and the number of patients consulted by week during this pandemic (p<0.001). In general, there was a decrease in the overall activities in cardiovascular care delivery. The majority of cardiology services (76.5%) and consulting programs (85%) were adjusted to the pandemic. Only half of the participants were satisfied with their workload. Reconfiguration of the consultation schedule was associated with a reduced satisfaction of participants (p=0.02). Conclusions: COVID-19 is associated with an overall reduction in cardiology services rendered in Africa. Since the cardiovascular burdens continue to increase in this part of the World and the risk of cardiovascular complications linked to SARS COV2 remains unchanged cardiology, departments in Africa should anticipate a significant surge of cardiology services demanded by patients after the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chris Nadege Nganou-Gnindjio","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Mazou Ngou Temgoua","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Liliane Mfeukeu Kuate","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Clovis Nkoke","author_inst":"Internal Medicine depatment, Buea"},{"author_name":"Joel Noutakdie Tochie","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Valerie Ndobo-Kue","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Amalia Owona-Nsiaguam","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Jerome Boombhi","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Richie Kipenge","author_inst":"Lubumbashi University Clinics, DRCongo"},{"author_name":"Urbain Huba","author_inst":"University Teaching Hospital, Yalgado Ouedraogo, Burkina faso"},{"author_name":"Malick Kane","author_inst":"National University Teaching Hospital, Fann, Senegal"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Taha el Jirari","author_inst":"National University Teaching Hospital, Fann, Senegal"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Ndongo-Amougou","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Ba Hamadou","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Alain Menanga","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Samuel Kingue","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Andrea L.

We have suggested previously that the infection rate of this virus might be lower in people living at high altitude (over 2,500 m) compared to that in the lowlands. Based on data from official sources, we performed a new epidemiological analysis of the development of the pandemic in 23 countries on the American continent as of May 23, 2020. Our results confirm our previous finding, further showing that the incidence of COVID-19 on the American continent decreases significantly starting at 1,000 m above sea level (masl). Moreover, epidemiological modeling indicates that the virus transmission rate capacity is lower in the highlands (>1,000 masl) than in the lowlands (<1,000 masl). Finally, evaluating the differences in the recovery percentage of patients, the death-to-case ratio, and the theoretical fraction of undiagnosed cases, we found that the severity of COVID-19 is also decreased above 1,000 m. We conclude that the impact of the COVID-19 decreases significantly with altitude.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Arias-Reyes","author_inst":"Institute Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Quebec (IUCPQ), Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Favio Carvajal-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Institute Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Quebec (IUCPQ), Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Liliana Poma-Machicao","author_inst":"Institute Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Quebec (IUCPQ), Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Aliaga-Raduan","author_inst":"Institute Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Quebec (IUCPQ), Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Danuzia A.

Early efforts to predict hospital bed needs focused on deriving predictions from SIR models, largely at the level of countries, provinces, or states. In the United States, these models rely on data reported by state health agencies. However, predictive disease and hospitalization dynamics at the state level are complicated by geographic variation in disease parameters. In addition it is difficult to make forecasts early in a pandemic due to minimal data. However, Bayesian approaches that allow models to be specified with informed prior information from areas that have already completed a disease curve can serve as prior estimates for areas that are beginning their curve. Here, a Bayesian non-linear regression (Weibull function) was used to forecast cumulative and active COVID-19 hospitalizations for South Dakota, USA. As expected, early forecasts were dominated by prior information, which was derived from New York City. Importantly, hospitalization trends also differed within South Dakota due to early peaks in an urban area, followed by later peaks in other rural areas of the state. Combining these trends led to altered forecasts with relevant policy implications.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeff S Wesner","author_inst":"University of South Dakota"},{"author_name":"Dan Van Peursem","author_inst":"University of South Dakota"},{"author_name":"Jose Flores","author_inst":"University of South Dakota"},{"author_name":"Yuhlong Lio","author_inst":"University of South Dakota"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Wesner","author_inst":"University of South Dakota"},{"author_name":"Felipe F Reichert","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Marcelo C da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Airton J Rombaldi","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Zubieta-Calleja","author_inst":"High Altitude Pulmonary and Pathology Institute IPPA.

Our protocol rests on data collected in collaboration with Alliance Laundry Systems (ALS) and the CDC\/NIOSH laboratories, under the \"NPPTL Respirator Assess- ments to Support the COVID-19 Response\" initiative. We test the two most widely available ALS tumbler models, the UTF75N and UT075N, and show that if our procedure is carefully followed, the masks will be subject to suitably high and stable temperatures for decontamination; in particular the masks will be heated to at least 80C for at least 65 min. For the mask models 3M 1860, 3M 8511, and Halyard 62126, we establish that they pass quantitative fit tests and retain sufficient filtration performance after three cycles of our decontamination procedure. All masks used in this study were new and uncontaminated: the evidence for the levels of biological inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is provided by [1]. While the protocol outlined here is currently specific to certain tested dryer models, this equipment is widely available, with machines estimated to be within 15 minutes of most US hospitals. Models from other manufacturers may also be appropriate for this decontamination method, though we stress the need for explicit testing on alternative models before use.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuri D.

The aim of the study was to expand understanding on the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the affected Lombardy areas. To this purpose, twenty full length genomes were collected from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020. The obtained genome assemblies, available on the GISAD database and performed at the Referral Center for COVID-19 diagnosis, identified 2 main monophyletic clades, containing 9 and 52 isolates, respectively. The molecular clock analysis estimated a clusters divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains spread all over the world at different time, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, the epidemiological reconstruction carried out by this work highlights multiple inputs of the virus into its initial circulation in Lombardy Region. However, a phylogenetic reconstruction robustness will be improved when other genomic sequences will be available, in order to guarantee a complete epidemiological surveillance.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valeria Micheli","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Giordana Rimoldi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesca Romeri","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesco Comandatore","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Mancon","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Gigantiello","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matteo Brilli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Mileto","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cristina Pagani","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Lombardi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, L.Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"- Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Diagnostic of Bioemergencies Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Sylvie Ndongo-Amougou","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Ba Hamadou","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Alain Menanga","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Samuel Kingue","author_inst":"FMSB-UYI"},{"author_name":"Andrea L.

Certain of the current vaccines entering phase 3 trials are based on the original D614 form of Spike with the goal of eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies. To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against the receptor binding domain and by convalescent sera from people known to be infected with either the D614 or G614 form of the virus. These results indicate that a gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies, and that the mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Drew Weissman","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Mohamad-Gabriel Alameh","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Tushan de Silva","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Paul Collini","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Hailey Hornsby","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brown","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Celia C LaBranche","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Edwards","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Laura Sutherland","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sampa Santra","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Mansouri","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gobeil","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Charlene McDanal","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Norbert Pardi","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"LANL"},{"author_name":"Paulo J.C.
