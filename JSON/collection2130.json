With the excretion of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, its genome detection in the sewage water can be used as a powerful epidemiological tool to predict the number of positive cases in a population. This study was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2 genome in sewage water during the lockdown. Sewage samples, from 28 pre-selected sites, were collected on alternate days from 13-25 July, 2020 from two selected areas [Johar Town (n = 05) and Township (n = 23)], where smart lockdown were implemented by the government authorities on 9th July, 2020. Genomic RNA was extracted and the SARS-CoV-2 was detected and quantified using commercially available kit through Real-Time PCR. Out of 28, sixteen samples were positive on day one while 19, 17, 23, 17, 05 and 09 samples were positive on day 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13, respectively. These results indicate the decreasing viral copy load with the passage of time however few sites did not followed a clear pattern indicating the complexities in sewage water based surveillance i.e time of sampling. Hourly sampling from two sites for 24 hours also revealed the impact of time sampling time on detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in sewage pipelines and lift\/disposal stations. Results of current study indicate a possible role of sewage-based COVID-19 surveillance in monitoring and execution of smart lockdowns.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tahir Yaqub","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Nawaz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Zubair Shabbir","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Asad Ali","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Imran Altaf","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sohail Raza","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Abu Bakr Shabbir","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan Ashraf","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Syed Zahid Aziz","author_inst":"Water and Sanitation Agency, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sohail Qadir Cheema","author_inst":"Water and Sanitation Agency, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Bilal Shah","author_inst":"Water and Sanitation Agency, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hassan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mehmood","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Tahir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia Attique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Asif","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nabeel Ahmad Awan","author_inst":"Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Usman Younis","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Huda Sarwar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maaz Sohail Rana","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.20165480","rel_title":"Clinical course and severity outcome indicators among COVID 19 hospitalized patients in relation to comorbidities distribution Mexican cohort","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20165480","rel_abs":"Introduction: COVID-19 affected worldwide, causing to date, around 500,000 deaths. In Mexico, by April 29, the general case fatality was 6.52%, with 11.1% confirmed case mortality and hospital recovery rate around 72%. Once hospitalized, the odds for recovery and hospital death rates depend mainly on the patients' comorbidities and age. In Mexico, triage guidelines use algorithms and risk estimation tools for severity assessment and decision-making. The study's objective is to analyze the underlying conditions of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Mexico concerning four severity outcomes. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort based on registries of all laboratory-confirmed patients with the COVID-19 infection that required hospitalization in Mexico. Independent variables were comorbidities and clinical manifestations. Dependent variables were four possible severity outcomes: (a) pneumonia, (b) mechanical ventilation (c) intensive care unit, and (d) death; all of them were coded as binary Results: We included 69,334 hospitalizations of laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized patients to June 30, 2020. Patients were 55.29 years, and 62.61% were male. Hospital mortality among patients aged<15 was 9.11%, 51.99% of those aged >65 died. Male gender and increasing age predicted every severity outcome. Diabetes and hypertension predicted every severity outcome significantly. Obesity did not predict mortality, but CKD, respiratory diseases, cardiopathies were significant predictors. Conclusion: Obesity increased the risk for pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care admittance, but it was not a predictor of in-hospital death. Patients with respiratory diseases were less prone to develop pneumonia, to receive mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit assistance, but they were at higher risk of in-hospital death.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genny Carrillo","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Nina Mendez Dominguez","author_inst":"Universidad Marista, School of Medicina, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Kassandra D Santos Zaldivar","author_inst":"Universidad Marista de Merida, Yucatan, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rochel Perez","author_inst":"Universidad Marista de Merida, Yucatan, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Mario Azuela Morales","author_inst":"Universidad Marista de Merida, Yucatan, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Osman Cuevas Koh","author_inst":"Universidad Marista de Merida, Yucatan,Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alberto Alvarez Baeza","author_inst":"Universidad Marista de Merida, Yucatan, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan Ashraf","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Syed Zahid Aziz","author_inst":"Water and Sanitation Agency, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sohail Qadir Cheema","author_inst":"Water and Sanitation Agency, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Bilal Shah","author_inst":"Water and Sanitation Agency, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hassan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mehmood","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Tahir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia Attique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Asif","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nabeel Ahmad Awan","author_inst":"Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Usman Younis","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Huda Sarwar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maaz Sohail Rana","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.20166264","rel_title":"Risk stratification as a tool to rationalize quarantine among health care workers exposed to COVID-19 cases - Evidence from a tertiary healthcare centre in India","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20166264","rel_abs":"Background: Quarantine of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID 19 confirmed cases is a well known strategy for limiting the transmission of infection. However, there is a need for evidence-based guidelines for the quarantine of HCWs in COVID 19. Methods: We describe our experience of contact tracing and risk stratification of 3853 HCWs who were exposed to confirmed COVID-19 cases in a tertiary health care institution in India. We developed an algorithm, on the basis of risk stratification, to rationalize quarantine among HCWs. Risk stratification was based on the duration of exposure, distance from the patient, and appropriateness of personal protection equipment (PPE) usage. Only high-risk contacts were quarantined for 14 days. They underwent testing for COVID 19 after five days of exposure, while low risk contacts continued their work with adherence to physical distancing, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of PPE. The low-risk contacts were encouraged to monitor for symptoms and report for COVID 19 screening if fever, cough, or shortness of breath occurred. We followed up all contacts for 14 days from the last exposure and observed for symptoms of COVID 19 and test positivity. Results and interpretation: Out of total 3853 contacts, 560 (14.5%) were categorized as high-risk contacts, and 40 of them were detected positive for COVID 19, with a test positivity rate of 7.1% (95% CI = 5.2, 9.6). Overall, 118 (3.1%) of all contacts tested positive. Our strategy prevented 3215 HCWs from being quarantined and saved 45,010 person-days of health workforce until June 8, 2020, in the institution. We conclude that exposure-based risk stratification and quarantine of HCWs is a viable strategy to prevent unnecessary quarantine, in a healthcare institution.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ravneet Kaur","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shashi Kant","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohan Bairwa","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Arvind Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shivram Dhakad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Dwarakanathan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aftab Ahmad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pooja Pandey","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Arti Kapil","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Lodha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hassan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mehmood","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Tahir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia Attique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Asif","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nabeel Ahmad Awan","author_inst":"Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Usman Younis","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Huda Sarwar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maaz Sohail Rana","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.20165654","rel_title":"Delayed Interventions, Low Compliance, and Health Disparities Amplified the Early Spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20165654","rel_abs":"The United States (US) public health interventions were rigorous and rapid, yet failed to arrest the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as infections spread throughout the US. Many factors have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, and the success of public health interventions depends on the level of community adherence to preventative measures. Public health professionals must also understand regional demographic variation in health disparities and determinants to target interventions more effectively. In this study, a systematic evaluation of three significant interventions employed in the US, and their effectiveness in slowing the early spread of COVID-19 was conducted. Next, community-level compliance with a state-level stay at home orders was assessed to determine COVID-19 spread behavior. Finally, health disparities that may have contributed to the disproportionate acceleration of early COVID-19 spread between certain counties were characterized. The contribution of these factors for the disproportionate spread of the disease was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results of this investigation show that delayed implementation of public health interventions, a low level of compliance with the stay at home orders, in conjunction with health disparities, significantly contributed to the early spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliea M.

We also identify areas susceptible to new hotspot emergence in response to moderate expansion of urbanization, livestock production, or forest disturbance, thereby highlighting regions vulnerable to SARS-CoV spillover under future land-use change. In China population growth and increasing meat consumption associated with urbanization and economic development have expanded the footprint of agriculture, leading to human encroachment in wildlife habitat and increased livestock density in areas adjacent to fragmented forests.

This is primarily due to limited testing, lack of reporting infrastructure and a large number of asymptomatic infections. In addition, diagnostic tests (RT-PCR tests for detecting current infection) and serological antibody tests for IgG (to assess past infections) are imperfect. In particular, the diagnostic tests have a high false negative rate. Epidemiologic models with a latent compartment for unascertained infections like the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) models can provide predictions for unreported cases and deaths under certain assumptions. Typically, the number of unascertained cases is unobserved and thus we cannot validate these estimates for a real study except for simulation studies. Population-based seroprevalence studies can provide a rough estimate of the total number of infections and help us check epidemiologic model projections. In this paper, we develop a method to account for high false negative rates in RT-PCR in an extension to the classic SEIR model. We apply this method to Delhi, the national capital region of India, with a population of 19.8 million and a COVID-19 hotspot of the country, obtaining estimates of underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 times and that for deaths at 8-13 times. Based on a recently released serological survey for Delhi with an estimated 22.86% seroprevalence, we compute adjusted estimates of the true number of infections reported by the survey (after accounting for misclassification of the antibody test results) which is largely consistent with the model outputs, yielding an underreporting factor for cases from 30-42. Together with the model and the serosurvey, this implies approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported and whereas only 109,140 cases were reported on July 10, the true number of infections varied somewhere between 4.4-4.6 million across different estimates. While repeated serological monitoring is resource intensive, model-based adjustments, run with the most up to date data, can provide a viable option to keep track of the unreported cases and deaths and gauge the true extent of transmission of this insidious virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Ritwik Bhaduri","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Ritoban Kundu","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Ellington","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Gentian Buzi","author_inst":"Biola University"},{"author_name":"Jason Wilson","author_inst":"Biola University"},{"author_name":"Thushara Galbadage","author_inst":"Biola University"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Lodha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hassan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mehmood","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Tahir Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia Attique","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ali Asif","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nabeel Ahmad Awan","author_inst":"Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Usman Younis","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Huda Sarwar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maaz Sohail Rana","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.20165019","rel_title":"A throughput serological Western blot system using whole virus lysate for the concomitant detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and human endemic Coronaviridae","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20165019","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Seroreactivity against human endemic coronaviruses has been linked to disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assays that are capable of concomitantly detecting antibodies against endemic coronaviridae such as OC43, 229E, NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate this question. We set up a platform for serum-screening and developed a bead-based Western blot system, namely DigiWest, capable of running hundreds of assays using microgram amounts of protein prepared directly from different viruses. METHODS: The parallelized and miniaturised DigiWest assay was adapted for detecting antibodies using whole protein extract prepared from isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. After characterisation and optimization of the newly established test, whole virus lysates of OC43, 229E, and NL63 were integrated into the system. RESULTS: The DigiWest-based immunoassay system for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies shows a sensitivity of 87.2 % and diagnostic specificity of 100 %. Concordance analysis with the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays available by Roche, Siemens, and Euroimmun indicates a comparable assay performance (Cohen's Kappa ranging from 0.8799-0.9429). In the multiplexed assay, antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63 were detected, displaying a high incidence of seroreactivity against these coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: The DigiWest-based immunoassay, which uses authentic antigens from isolated virus particles, is capable of detecting individual serum responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high specificity and sensitivity in one multiplexed assay. It shows high concordance with other commercially available serologic assays. The DigiWest approach enables a concomitant detection of antibodies against different endemic coronaviruses and will help to elucidate the role of these possibly cross-reactive antibodies.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Fink","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Felix Ruoff","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Aaron Stahl","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Matthias Becker","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Philipp Kaiser","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Bjoern Traenkle","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Junker","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Frank Weise","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ruetalo","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Hoerber","author_inst":"Central Laboratory, Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Peter","author_inst":"Central Laboratory, Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Juliane Walz","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"G&eacuterard Krause","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katja Schenke-Layland","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Reutlingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Joos","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Reutlingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Rothbauer","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Reutlingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nicole Schneiderhan-Marra","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Schindler","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus F Templin","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Ali Asif","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nabeel Ahmad Awan","author_inst":"Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Usman Younis","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Huda Sarwar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maaz Sohail Rana","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.20165837","rel_title":"Investigation into the Release of Respiratory Aerosols by Brass Instruments and Mitigation Measures with Respect to Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20165837","rel_abs":"There are a number of recent studies detailing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) via both Droplet and Aerosol airborne particle routes of infection. Because of this, it is necessary to understand the release of different sized particles in activities such as playing brass instruments in order for an analysis of risk to take place for such activities. In this investigation, the quantity and size of particles released by brass instruments while they are played was analysed for 7 different types of brass instrument. This was contrasted with the same individuals breathing as a comparison for more general activities as well as the effect of a mitigating polycotton barrier over the end of their instruments. To investigate the particles released, the particles were size sorted and counted with a six-channel laser particle counter. Multiple measurements were made by each individual in each condition investigated. The mean concentration exiting across all instruments measured was found to be 1.21x107{+\/-}1.03x106 Aerosol type particles\/m3 and 1.43x104{+\/-}9.01x102 Droplet type particles\/m3 per minute. When breathing, the mean count was 1.61x107{+\/-}1.33x106 Aerosol type particle\/m3 and 5.45x103{+\/-}1.20x103 Droplet type particles\/m3. When playing with a barrier cover, the mean number of particles emitted fell to 2.60x106{+\/-}2.11x105 Aerosol type particle\/m3 and 5.20x103{+\/-}8.02x102 Droplet type particles\/m3. This barrier represented an average 78.5% reduction for the number of respiratory Aerosol type particles and 63.8% reduction for Droplet type particles compared to playing an instrument without the barrier covering. It was investigated what effect playing for a more extended period of time had on the release of particles with comparisons made to singing, breathing and covering the instruments' bell ends with a barrier cap. This showed that the mean number of Aerosol type particles produced while playing was 5.38x107{+\/-}3.15x106 Aerosol type particles\/m3 produced and showed a significant drop in Aerosol type particle production when playing with a barrier used, with a mean average of 2.28x106{+\/-}8.01x104 Aerosol type particles\/m3. Both breathing and singing showed consistent numbers of Aerosol type particles produced with means of 6.59x107{+\/-}7.94x105 Aerosol type particles\/m3 and 5.28x107{+\/-}5.36x105 Aerosol type particles\/m3 respectively. This showed a drop in mean Aerosol type particles\/m3 of 95.7% when using a barrier cap compared to playing without a barrier. It is concluded that, while playing a brass instrument, the propagation of respiratory Aerosols does occur and, to a smaller extent, so do Droplet size particles, but at a lower level than when the subject was breathing without an instrument. Finally, it was shown that the use of a barrier cap on the bell end of the instrument offers a significant reduction in the production of respiratory Aerosols into the immediate surroundings, which offers a possible mitigation method for playing in groups from the release of Aerosol type particles, especially in hard to ventilate spaces.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Stuart Parker","author_inst":"Brass Bands England"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Crookston","author_inst":"Brass Bands England"},{"author_name":"Aaron Stahl","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Matthias Becker","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Philipp Kaiser","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Bjoern Traenkle","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Junker","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Frank Weise","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ruetalo","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Hoerber","author_inst":"Central Laboratory, Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Peter","author_inst":"Central Laboratory, Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Juliane Walz","author_inst":"Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"G&eacuterard Krause","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katja Schenke-Layland","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Reutlingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thomas Joos","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Reutlingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Rothbauer","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen, Reutlingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nicole Schneiderhan-Marra","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Schindler","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus F Templin","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Ali Asif","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nabeel Ahmad Awan","author_inst":"Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Usman Younis","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti","author_inst":"Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Huda Sarwar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Maaz Sohail Rana","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore-Pakistan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.01.20166553","rel_title":"Evidence for sustained mucosal and systemic antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.01.20166553","rel_abs":"While the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively studied in blood, relatively little is known about the mucosal immune response and its relationship to systemic antibody levels. Since SARS-CoV-2 initially replicates in the upper airway, the antibody response in the oral cavity is likely an important parameter that influences the course of infection. We developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assays to detect IgA and IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (full length trimer) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) in serum (n=496) and saliva (n=90) of acute and convalescent patients with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 ranging from 3-115 days post-symptom onset (PSO), compared to negative controls. Anti-CoV-2 antibody responses were readily detected in serum and saliva, with peak IgG levels attained by 16-30 days PSO. Whereas anti-CoV-2 IgA antibodies rapidly decayed, IgG antibodies remained relatively stable up to 115 days PSO in both biofluids. Importantly, IgG responses in saliva and serum were correlated, suggesting that antibodies in the saliva may serve as a surrogate measure of systemic immunity.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baweleta Isho","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Kento T Abe","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario;

Methods We investigated GT online searches for the search terms toothache and tooth pain, within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of national\/regional lockdowns in each country. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We analysed data after normalising based on the Internet penetration rate. We used one-way ANOVA to identify statistical difference for RSVs between 2020 and 2016-2019 for each country. A linear regression model was used to assess whether there is a correlation between RSVs in 2020 and gross domestic production, COVID-19 deaths, dentists' density, YLDs of oral conditions, Internet access, lockdown duration, Education Index, and dental expenditure per capita. Results The results of worldwide RSVs for toothache and tooth pain also showed significantly higher values in 2020 compared to the previous four years. Of 23 included countries in our study, 16 showed significantly increased RSVs during the lockdown period compared to the same periods in the past four years. There was a statistically significant relationship between difference of RSVs means in 2020 and in 2016-2019 combined with percent of urban residency (B=-1.82; 95% CI: (-3.38, -0.26); p=0.026) and dental expenditure per capita (B=-0.42; 95% CI: (-0.80, -0.05); p=0.031) (R2=0.66). Conclusion Generally, the interest in toothache and tooth pain has significantly increased in 2020 compared to the last four years. This could implicitly reinforce the importance of dental care, as urgent medical care worldwide. Governments' expenditure on oral healthcare and the rate of urban residency, could be mentioned as important factors to direct general populations' online care-seeking behaviour with regard to dental pain.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Sofi-Mahmudi","author_inst":"Cochrane Iran Associate Centre, National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Erfan Shamsoddin","author_inst":"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Peyman Ghasemi","author_inst":"Department of Health Economics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mona Nasser","author_inst":"Peninsula Dental School, Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth, UK."},{"author_name":"Bita Mesgarpour","author_inst":"Cochrane Iran Associate Centre, National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Jenny H Wang","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Gary Chao","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29\/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.6 days). We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. This translates to herd immunity thresholds needed to stop transmission to be between 73% and 84%. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depends on R0, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruian Ke","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ethan Obie Romero-Severson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Steven Sanche","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Jing","author_inst":"Shanxi medical university"},{"author_name":"Binzhi Ren","author_inst":"Shanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianguo Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Diseas"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

Towards addressing this need, we applied a stochastic transmission model to quantify the impact of university-level responses to past outbreaks on their campuses and used it to determine which control interventions are most effective. The model aims to simultaneously overcome three crucial issues: stochastic variation in small populations, missing or unobserved case data, and changes in disease transmission rates post-intervention. We tested the model and assessed various interventions using data from the 2014 and 2016 mumps outbreaks at Ohio State University and Harvard University, respectively. Our results suggest that universities should design more aggressive diagnostic procedures and stricter isolation policies to decrease infectious disease incidence on campus. Our model can be applied to data from other outbreaks in college campuses and similar small-population settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mirai Shah","author_inst":"Harvard College"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Ferra","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Susan Fitzgerald","author_inst":"Harvard University Health Services"},{"author_name":"Paul Barreira","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pardis Sabeti","author_inst":"Harvard University;

Mounting scientific evidence from observational studies suggests that face masks for the general public may reduce the spread of infections. However, results from randomized control trials (RCT) have been presented as inconclusive, and concerns related to the safety and efficacy of non-surgical face masks in non-clinical settings remain. This controversy calls for a meta-analysis which considers non-compliance in RCTs, the time-lag in benefits of universal masking, and possible adverse effects. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs of non-surgical face masks in preventing viral respiratory infections in non-hospital and non-household settings at cumulative and maximum follow-up as primary endpoints. The search for RCTs yielded five studies published before May 29th, 2020. We pooled estimates from the studies and performed random-effects meta-analysis and mixed-effects meta-regression across studies, accounting for covariates in compliance vs. non-compliance in treatment. Results: Face masks decreased infections across all studies at maximum follow-up (p=0.0318$, RR=0.608 [0.387 - 0.956]), and particularly in studies without non-compliance bias. We found significant between-study heterogeneity in studies with bias (I^2=71.2%, p=0.0077). We also used adjusted meta-regression to account for heterogeneity. The results support a significant protective effect of masking (p=0.0006, beta=0.0214, SE= 0.0062). No severe adverse effects were detected. Interpretation: The meta-analysis of existing randomized control studies found support for the efficacy of face masks among the general public. Our results show that face masks protect populations from infections and do not pose a significant risk to users. Recommendations and clear communication concerning the benefits of face masks should be provided to limit the number of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanna M Ollila","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Markku Partinen","author_inst":"Helsinki Sleep Clinic, Vitalmed Research Center and Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Jukka Koskela","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Riikka Savolainen","author_inst":"Newcastle University Business School,  \t    Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Anna Rotkirch","author_inst":"Population Research Institute, Vaestoliitto - The Family Federation of Finland"},{"author_name":"Liisa T Laine","author_inst":"Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, The Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jianguo Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Diseas"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple mobility trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data from Descartes Labs, and 4) Twitter mobility calculated via weighted distance. We further design a Responsive Index (RI) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the RI between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearson r coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The positive correlation between RI and income at the county level is significant in all mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in RI between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that cross-compares multi-source mobility datasets. The findings shed light on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Huang","author_inst":"University of Arkansas"},{"author_name":"Zhenlong Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Yuqin Jiang","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Ye","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Chengbin Deng","author_inst":"State University of New York at Binghamton"},{"author_name":"Jiajia Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

Preliminary evidence suggests that preterm births dropped dramatically following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We undertook a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on 9, 15, and 23 March 2020 on the incidence of preterm birth. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010-2020) and cross-validated these against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were conducted according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socio-economic status. Results Data on 1,599,549 singleton newborns were available, including 56,720 post-implementation births. Consistent reductions in preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding implementation of the 9 March COVID-19 mitigation measures: +\/- 2 months (n=531,823): odds ratio 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.91), p=0.002; +\/- 3 months (n=796,531): 0.85 (0.73-0.98), p=0.028; +\/- 4 months (n=1,066,872): 0.84 (0.73-0.97), p=0.023. Decreases observed following the 15 March measures were of smaller magnitude and not statistically significant. No changes were observed after 23 March. Preterm birth reductions after 9 March were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to high-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods, but effect modification was not statistically significant. Conclusion In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a 15-23% drop in preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations in other countries. It is now of pivotal importance that integration of comparable data from across the globe is undertaken to further substantiate these findings and start exploring the underlying mechanisms.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasper V Been","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Lizbeth Burgos Ochoa","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Loes CM Bertens","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Sam Schoenmakers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Eric AP Steegers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Irwin KM Reiss","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

A plethora of facial coverings and respirators, both commercial and homemade, pervade the market, but the true filtration capabilities of many homemade measures against the virus are unclear and continue to be unexplored. In this work, we compare the efficacy of the following masks in keeping out particulate matter below 2.5 microns: N95 respirators, surgical masks, cloth masks, cloth masks with activated carbon air filters, cloth masks with HVAC air filters, lightly starch-enhanced cloth masks, and heavily-starched cloth masks. The experiments utilize an inhalation system and aerosol chamber to simulate a masked individual respiring aerosolized air. COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in low-income communities, who often lack the resources to acquire appropriate personal protective equipment and tend to lack the flexibility to shelter in place due to their public-facing occupations. This work tests low-cost enhancements to homemade masks to assist these communities in making better masks to reduce viral transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the filtration efficacy of cloth masks with either a light or heavy starch can approach the performance of much costlier masks. This discovery supports the idea of low-cost enhancements to reduce transmission and protect individuals from contracting COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hari Bhimaraju","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Nitish Nag","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Jain","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Sam Schoenmakers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Eric AP Steegers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Irwin KM Reiss","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19. Methods: Sixteen COVID-19 patients received transfusion of anti-COVID-19 antibody-positive convalescent plasma. The main outcome was time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative. Clinical laboratory parameters were measured at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion as well. Results: Among the 16 patients, 10 of them had a consistently positive result of viral NAA test before convalescent plasma transfusion. Eight patients (8\/10) became negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative after transfusion (mean rank 2.17 vs 5.90, P = 0.036). Two critically ill patients transfused plasma with lower antibody level remained a positive result of NAA test. CRP level demonstrated a decline 1 day after convalescent plasma treatment, compared with the baseline (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion. Conclusions: Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative on the 2nd to 8th days after transfusion, and the negative time of severe patients was shorter than that of critically ill patients.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shanshan Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chunya Lu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Lei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Huaqi Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qiankun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Liyinghui Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianbin Li","author_inst":"Henan Red Cross Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Ma","author_inst":"Henan Red Cross Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Qian Sang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Luyang Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiangjin Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Kang","author_inst":"Henan Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lihua Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guojun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliatied Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Aimee Paterson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yue Feng Yun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Lina M Marin","author_inst":"College of Dentistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Caldwell","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario;

Pediatric surgery is not an exception. Prioritization protocols allowing us to provide emergency surgical care to the children in need while controlling the pandemic spread. The aim of this study is to share our experiences with the outcome of children with COVID 19 who had a co existing surgical emergency. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency department and later diagnosed to have COVID 19 by RT PCR. The study duration was 3 months (April 2020 to June 2020). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken from all patients irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR with the purpose of detecting asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms. Emergency surgical services were provided immediately without delay and patients with positive test results were isolated according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients into 4 age groups for the convenience of data analysis. Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using SPSS (version 25) software. Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board. Results: Total patients were 32. Seven (21.9%) of them were neonates. Twenty four (75%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception. Only two patients had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%) patients. Fourteen (43.8%) patients required surgical treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.5 days. One neonate with ARM died in the postoperative ward due to cardiac arrest. No patient had hypoxemia or organ failure. Seven health care workers (5.51%) including doctors & nurses got infected with SARS Co V2 during this period. Conclusion: Our study has revealed a milder course of COVID 19 in children with minimal infectivity even when present in association with emergency surgical conditions. This might encourage a gradual restart to mitigate the impact of COVID 19 on children surgery.

Methods: We analyzed 255 serum specimens from 130 COVID-19 patients and examined clinical records and laboratory data. Presence of total (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and specific IgG antibody for the spike 1 antigen of SARS-CoV2 was determined using VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. Findings: Overall, 98 (75.4%) and 32 (24.6%) patients had mild and severe COVID-19, respectively. On admission, 76 (58.5%) and 45 (34.6%) patients were positive for total and IgG antibody assays. Among 91 patients at discharge, 90 (98.9%) and 81 (89.0%) patients were positive for total and IgG antibody, respectively. Clinical background and laboratory findings on admission, but not the prevalence or concentration of total or IgG antibody, were associated with disease prognosis. Total and IgG antibody intensity were significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases in serum collected after 11 days from onset, but not within 10 days. Conclusion: VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and IgG assays will be useful as supporting diagnostic and surveillance tools and for evaluation of humoral immune response to COVID-19. Clinical background and laboratory findings are preferable predictors of disease prognosis.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayu Nagura-Ikeda","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuo Imai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Katsumi Kubota","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Noguchi","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yutaro Kitagawa","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masaru Matsuoka","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Tabata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Luyang Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiangjin Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Kang","author_inst":"Henan Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lihua Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guojun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliatied Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Aimee Paterson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yue Feng Yun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Lina M Marin","author_inst":"College of Dentistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Caldwell","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario;

As a result, post-lockdown COVID-19 dynamics are heterogenous and difficult to interpret. Here we describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changsha) during the pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-lockdown period to quantify the transmission impact of relaxing interventions via changes in age-specific contact patterns. We estimate that the mean number of contacts increased 5%-17% since the end of the lockdown but are still 3-7 times lower than their pre-pandemic levels. We find that post-lockdown contact patterns in China are still sufficiently low to keep SARS-CoV-2 transmission under control. We also find that the impact of school interventions depends non-linearly on the share of other activities being resumed. When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77% decrease in the reproductive number; in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5% reduction in transmission. Moving forward, to control COVID-19 spread without resorting to a lockdown, it will be key to dose relaxation in social mixing in the community and strengthen targeted interventions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Huilin Shi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Luyang Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiangjin Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Kang","author_inst":"Henan Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lihua Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guojun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliatied Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Aimee Paterson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yue Feng Yun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Lina M Marin","author_inst":"College of Dentistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Caldwell","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario;

Reliable high-throughput serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) are urgently needed for the effective containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is of crucial importance to understand the strength and duration of immunity after infection, and to make informed decisions concerning the activation or discontinuation of physical distancing restrictions. Methods. In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Findings. Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.8%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT50 correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (rho = 0.541, p < 0.001). Interpretation. The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection. Further studies should be conducted to achieve a stronger correlation between antibody measurement and PRNT50 in order to obtain useful information for providing effective passive antibody therapy, and developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"university of padova"},{"author_name":"Laura Sciacovelli","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedale Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesco Bonfante","author_inst":"Istituto Zooprofilattico Veneto"},{"author_name":"Matteo Pagliari","author_inst":"Zooprofilattico Veneto"},{"author_name":"Dania Bozzato","author_inst":"Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cosma","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedale Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Alessio Bortolami","author_inst":"Zooprofilattico Veneto"},{"author_name":"Davide Negrini","author_inst":"Universita di Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Zuin","author_inst":"Universita di padova"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Luyang Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiangjin Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Kang","author_inst":"Henan Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lihua Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guojun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliatied Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Aimee Paterson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yue Feng Yun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Lina M Marin","author_inst":"College of Dentistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Caldwell","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario;

Although the mathematical modelling of the virus has made relevant contributions, the unpredictable behaviour of the virus is still not fully understood. To identify some aspects of the virus elusive behaviour, we focused on the temporal characteristics of its course. We have analysed the latency trends the virus has realized worldwide, the outbreak of the hot spots, and the decreasing trends of the pandemic. We found that the spatio-temporal pandemic dynamics shows a power law distribution. As with physical systems, these changes in the pandemic's course, which we have called transitional stages of contagion, highlight shared characteristics in many countries. The main results of this work is that the pandemic progression rhythms have been clearly identified for each country, providing the processes and the stages at which the virus develops, thus giving important information on the activation of containment and control measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Bertacchini","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical, Energy and Management Engineering, University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Bilotta","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Pietro S.

Real-time RT - PCR (Reverse transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) is used to amplify the viral RNA and enable its detection. Although PCR is 37 years old, it is still considered, without dispute, as the gold standard. PCR is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in DNA amplification, microfluidics and membrane technologies, we succeeded to create a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT - LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or highly fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using pools of naso-pharyngal clinical samples, we estimated a sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR (up to a Cycle threshold of 39, equivalent to <0.1 TCID50 per mL) and a 100% specificity, for other human coronaviruses and eight respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called COVIDISC to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment paves the way towards a large dissemination of this device. The perspective of a reliable SARS-CoV-2 point of care detection, highly performing, that would deliver on-site results in less than one hour opens up a new efficient approach to manage the pandemics.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pierre Garneret","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Etienne Coz","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Elian Martin","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Jean-Claude Manuguerra","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Elodie Brient-Litzler","author_inst":"Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Vincent Enouf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Daniel Felipe Gonzalez Obando","author_inst":"Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin","author_inst":"Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Monti","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Van der Werf","author_inst":"CNR-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jessica Vanhomwegen","author_inst":"CIBU-Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jean Tabeling","author_inst":"ESPCI"},{"author_name":"Xiangjin Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Kang","author_inst":"Henan Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lihua Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guojun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliatied Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Aimee Paterson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yue Feng Yun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Lina M Marin","author_inst":"College of Dentistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Caldwell","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, "},{"author_name":"Karen Colwill","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Frank Sicheri","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, "},{"author_name":"Samira Mubareka","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON"},{"author_name":"Scott D Gray-Owen","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario; Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Steven J Drews","author_inst":"Canadian Blood Services, Edmonton, AB & Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"},{"author_name":"Walter L Siqueira","author_inst":"College of Dentistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Miriam Barrios-Rodiles","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Mario Ostrowski","author_inst":"St. Michaels Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"James M Rini","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario; Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yves Durocher","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute and Department of Microbiology at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System; Institute of Health Policy, Management and E"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Gommerman","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Anne-Claude Gingras","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canad"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
