Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan. Methods We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria. Findings 209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant, radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments\/day were performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments\/day post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected. Interpretation Herein, we show that in a susceptible population to COVID-19, strict infection control measures can curb human-to-human transmission, and ensure timely delivery of RT to cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conghua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyong Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhirong Bao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jing Yu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yahua Zhong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Melvin LK Chua","author_inst":"Division of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20034041","rel_title":"First Clinical Study Using HCV Protease Inhibitor Danoprevir to Treat Naive and Experienced COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20034041","rel_abs":"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3\/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Our findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongyi Chen","author_inst":"The first department of infectious disease, the nineth hospital of Nanchang, Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Zhang","author_inst":"The intensive care unit, the nineth hospital of Nanchang, Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The first department of infectious disease, the nineth hospital of Nanchang, Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Huang","author_inst":"The radiology department, the nineth hospital of Nanchang, Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China"},{"author_name":"Fanghua Gong","author_inst":"The second department of infectious disease, the nineth hospital of Nanchang, Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Li","author_inst":"Ascletis Bioscience Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China"},{"author_name":"Yahong Chen","author_inst":"Ascletis Bioscience Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China"},{"author_name":"Jinzi J.

In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Blanco-Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Nilsson-Payant","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Wen-Chun Liu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moeller","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maryline Panis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Sachs","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Randy Albrecht","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R. tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20040691","rel_title":"Meplazumab treats COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-labelled, concurrent controlled add-on clinical trial","rel_date":"2020-03-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20040691","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, there is no specific antiviral drugs. It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245. Findings:17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95%CI[0.155-0.833]). The percentages of patients recovered to the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated patients. Interpretation:Meplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile. Our results support to carry out a large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew D.

In this study, we compared the sex-related hormones between 81 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 100 age-matched healthy men, and found that serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly increased, but the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH were dramatically decreased in males with COVID-19. Besides, multivariable regression analysis indicated that c-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly associated with serum T:LH ratio in COVID-19 patients.

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID-19, are still lacking. Methods: Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir\/ritonavir (LPV\/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild\/moderate COVID-19. Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild\/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV\/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV\/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe\/critical(P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV\/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group. Conclusions: LPV\/r or arbidol monotherapy present little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with mild\/moderate COVID-19 over supportive care.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yueping Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Xie","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weiyin Lin","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weiping Cai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Wen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yujuan Guan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoneng Mo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yaping Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Peng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xudan Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenxin Hong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangming Xiao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinxin Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lieguang Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengyu Hu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuchun Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xilong Deng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Linghua Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Guo","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Benqi Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhizhong Ren","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuhao Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zheng You","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jiahong Dong","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Center for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biliary and Pancreatic Surgery\/Cancer Research Center Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Techn"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Nan Chen","author_inst":"National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine & Department of Cell Biology, Fourth Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Zhu","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20039198","rel_title":"The local stability of a modified multi-strain SIR model for emerging viral strains","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.19.20039198","rel_abs":"We study a novel multi-strain SIR epidemic model with selective immunity by vaccination.

Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability.

Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020. By analyzing the dual swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial\/fungal infections in confirmed NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province, there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenjiao Chang","author_inst":"The First

Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Methods Two key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case incidence and case morbidity. GP Practice data was used as this provided the most geographically granular source of published public population data. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, % age >16 at fulltime work\/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD 2019, Location as latitude\/longitude, and patient engagement as % self-confident in their own long term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated by applying the international mortality Odds Ratio to the local population relevant age and disease prevalences and then summing and dividing by the equivalent national figure. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. Results The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation with the significance of specific factors moderating over time as the balance between external infection, community transmission and impact of mitigation measures feeds through to the number of cases. It showed that currently Urban, % Working and age >60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative HC impact was wide with 80% of practices falling between 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included it showed that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. Conclusion Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health and social care resources across the country. This model provides a method for predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a method for targeting limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources to optimise national, regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Stedman","author_inst":"Res

We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM & IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Yee Wan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Siew Hoon

In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65*109\/L vs. 0.76*109\/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg\/L vs. 18.13 mg\/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kai

classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the epidemic peak, and the outbreak duration were obtained. Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration. These were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals. The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100 percent of children and 90 percent of adults. Interpretation As strong social distancing intervention strategies had the most effect in reducing the epidemic peak, this strategy may be considered when weaker strategies are first tried and found to be less effective. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society. Tradeoffs may need to be made between the effectiveness of social distancing strategies and population willingness to adhere to them.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George J

pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available. On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill COVID-19 patients than there are ICU beds within two weeks\\todo{last thing to do}. Despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used. Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. We hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob Deasy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Emma Rocheteau","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Katharina Kohler","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Daniel J.

SARS-CoV-2 has been a global pandemic, but the emergence of asymptomatic patients has caused difficulties in the prevention of the epidemic. Therefore, it is significant to understand the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, we collected data from 167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (Chongqing, China) from January to March 2020. The epidemiological characteristics and variable of these patients were collected and analyzed. Findings: 82.04% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a travel history in Wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from Wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe Covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from Wuhan. For the patients who was returnees from Wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. In different infection periods, compared with the proportion after 1\/31\/2020, the proportion of asymptomatic patient among SARS-CoV-2 infected patient was higher(19% VS 1.5%). In different age groups, the proportion of asymptomatic patient was the highest(28.6%) in children group under 14, next in elder group over 70 (27.3%). Compared with mild and common Covid-19 patients, the mean latency of asymptomatic was longer (11.25 days VS 8.86 days), but the hospital length of stay was shorter (14.3 days VS 16.96 days) . Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 prevention needs to focus on the screening of asymptomatic patients in the community with a history of contact with the imported population, especially for children and the elderly population.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Tao","author_inst":"Beibei Tranditional Chinese Medical Hospital, Chongqing, 400000, China"},{"author_name":"Panke

The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Caccavo","author_inst":"Department of Industrial

reported among Norwegians that had recently returned from Lombardy, Italy. Travellers from the region rapidly became the most common source of imported infections in the earliest stage of the Norwegian COVID-19 epidemic. The situation was exacerbated by the unfortunate temporal overlap between the Norwegian winter holidays and intense epidemic spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, resulting in a large number of infected travellers. Here we combined flight data on travels between Norway and Lombardy with patient-level data to determine the fraction of travellers returning to Norway that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Travellers returning to Norway from Lombardy contracted COVID-19 at incidence rates up to 0.02 per person-day in the period spanning February 21st and March 1st, with a clear uptick in transmission in the middle of the period. This shows an example of the infection risk in tourist destinations being several fold higher than elsewhere in the region. In Norway, this is also supported by high rates of infections among tourists returning from Austria in February and March, despite a low number of reported cases in the country at the time. The massive COVID-19 prevalence among travellers suggest that mandatory quarantine of returning travellers or suspension of non-essential international flights is essential if the aim is to control or suppress the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ola Brynildsrud","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vegard

China, and its spread increased rapidly, with cases arising across Mainland China and several other countries. By January 2020, the potential risks imposed by 2019-nCoV in human health and economical activity were promptly highlighted. Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to mitigate the number of infected and deaths. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission. Correlations between meteorological temperature and relative humidity with the number of daily confirmed cases were explored in this work for the epicenter city of Wuhan, China for the period from 29 January to March 6, 2020. Long-term trend of temperature and relative humidity was obtained with a 14-days adjacent-averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019-nCoV cases, where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Alvarez-Ramirez Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"},{"author_name":"MONICA MERAZ","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa"},{"author_name":"Oswaldo G Cruz","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

Next to that, through new estimates of the infection mortality rate, we recalculated a more plausible number of real infected.

(COVID-19) that started in China has already been \"exported\" to more than 140 countries in all the continents, evolving in most of them by local spreading. In this contribution we analyze the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported. Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give interpretations and possible explanations for them.

scenarios","rel_date":"2020-03-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.20.20039594","rel_abs":"Background: While the COVID-19 outbreak in China now appears surpressed, Europe and the US have become the epicenters, both reporting many more deaths than China. Responding to the pandemic, Sweden has taken a different approach aiming to mitigate, not suppressing community transmission, by using physical distancing without lock-downs. Here we contrast consequences of different responses to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, intensive care, the death tolls, and the associated direct healthcare related costs. Methods: We use an age stratified health-care demand extended SEIR compartmental model calibrated to the municipality level for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model describing inter-municipality mobility. Results: Our model fit well with the observed deaths in Sweden up to 20th of April, 2020. The intensive care unit (ICU) demand is estimated to reach almost 10,000 patients per day by early May in an unmitigated scenario, far above the pre-pandemic ICU capacity of 526 beds. In contrast, a scenario with moderate physical distancing and shielding of elderly in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals would reduce numbers to below 500 per day. This would substantially flatten the curve, extend the epidemic period, but a risk resurgence is expected if measures are relaxed. The different scenarios show quite different death tolls up to the 1th of September, ranging from 5,000 to 41,000 deaths, exluding deaths potentially caused by ICU shortage. Further, analyses of the total all-cause mortality in Stockholm indicate that a confirmed COVID-19 death is associated with a additional 0.40 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.57) all-cause death. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight the impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially moderate physical distancing and shielding of elderly in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals, on reducing deaths and lower healthcare costs. In less effective mitigation scenarios, the demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed capacity, showing the tight interconnection between the healthcare demand and physical distancing in the society. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and illustrate the importance of maintaining the level of physical distancing for a longer period to suppress or mitigate the impacts from the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joacim Rocklov","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Flavio Iannelli","author_inst":"URPP Social Networks, University of Zurich, Andreasstrasse 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Goncalves","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers. This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20 to 59 years 0.3% (5\/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193\/29,798), respectively. Conclusion The disease severity improved considerably over a short period of time in China. The more severe conditions in Wuhan compared to the rest of the country may be attributable to the draconian lockdown. The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID 19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wayne Gao","author_inst":"Taipei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mattia Sanna","author_inst":"Taipei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chi Pang Wen","author_inst":"National Health Research Institute; China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Scientific Computing Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. Methods: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the United States. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. Results: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 3.2% to 7.2% reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, ranging from 1.9% to 18.3% of healthcare worker households and 5.7% to 8.8% reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand. We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p < 0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 71.1% to 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. Conclusions: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU bed demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Child care subsidies could help circumvent the ostensible tradeoff between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth T Chin","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Q Huynh","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nathan C Lo","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Trevor Hastie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Basu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK , and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastory y Piontti","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.

global epidemic trends, geographic distribution, and transmission patterns of COVID-19 contribute to providing timely information for the global response of the epidemic. This study aims to understand the global pandemic geospatial patterns and trends and identify new epicenters requiring urgent attention. Methods: Data on COVID-19 between 31st Dec. 2019 and 14th Mar. 2020 was included. The epidemic trend was analyzed using joinpoint regressions; the growth of affected countries was by descriptive analysis; and the global distribution and transmission trend by spatial analysis. Findings: The number of new cases in the regions outside of China slowly increased before 24th Feb. and rapidly accelerated after 24th Feb. Compared to China, other affected countries experienced a longer duration of a slow increase at the early stage and rapid growth at the latter stages. The first apparent increase in the number of affected countries occurred from 23rd Jan to 1st Feb, and the second apparent increase started from 25th Feb. The fist COVID-19 cases reported by countries from 28th Feb. were mainly imported from Europe. The geographic distribution changed from single-center (13th Jan.-20th Feb.) to multi-centers pattern (20th Feb.-14th Mar.). More countries were affected with COVID-19 and developed local transmission. Interpretation: The joinpoint regression and geospatial analysis indicated a multi-center pandemic of COVID-19. Strategies to prevent the new multiple centers as well as prevent ongoing transmission are needed.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huipeng Liao","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Gifty Marley","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Nanjing Medical University and University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Yafei Si","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Zaisheng Wang","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Yewei Xie","author_inst":"University of North Carolina Project-China"},{"author_name":"Cheng Wang","author_inst":"Dermatology Hospital and the Institute of Global Health and STI Research of Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Weiming Tang","author_inst":"Dermatology Hospital, Southern Medical University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Project-China"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F.C.
