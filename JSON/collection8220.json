Individual level studies have found that the use of face masks was protective for the acquisition and transmission of a range of respiratory viruses including SARS CoV1. We hypothesized that population level usage of face masks may be negatively associated SARS CoV2 spread. Methods At a country level, linear regression was used to assess the association between COVID19 diagnoses per inhabitant and the national promotion of face masks in public (coded as a binary variable), controlling for the age of the COVID19 epidemic and testing intensity. Results Eight of the 49 countries with available data advocated wearing face masks in public: China, Czechia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia. In multivariate analysis face mask use was negatively associated with number of COVID19 cases\/inhabitant (coef. -326, 95% CI -601- -51, P=0.021). Testing intensity was positively associated with COVID-19 cases (coef. 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.08, P<0.001). Conclusion Whilst these results are susceptible to residual confounding, they do provide ecological level support to the individual level studies that found face mask usage to reduce the transmission and acquisition of respiratory viral infections.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chris Kenyon","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20048165","rel_title":"Association of BCG vaccination policy with prevalence and mortality of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20048165","rel_abs":"Background: Evidence suggests non-specific benefits of the tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) against non-related infections. Recent studies propose such protection may extend to the novel COVID-19 as well. This is a contested hypothesis. Methods: Our ecological study confronts this hypothesis. We examine the effects of BCG vaccination on countries' COVID-19 (a) cases and deaths (per million) and (b) exponential growth factors over specific periods of the pandemic. Since the BCG vaccine was derived from Mycobacterium bovis, a bacterium causing tuberculosis in cattle, having suffered from tuberculosis also may exert a non-specific protection against the COVID-19 as well. Along with BCG vaccination, we test the effect of the prevalence of tuberculosis. We employ multiple regression and principal component analysis (PCA) to control for potentially confounding variables (n = 16). Results: BCG vaccination policy and incidence of tuberculosis is associated with a reduction in both COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the effects of these two variables are additive ({approx} 5% to 15% of total unique variance explained). The study of exponential growth factors in the initial stages of the pandemic further shows that BCG vaccination exerts a significant effect (up to 35% of unique variance explained). Conclusions: Overall, these findings corroborate the hypothesis that BCG vaccination and exposure to tuberculosis may induce a non-specific protection against the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after accounting for a large number of confounding influences. However, given the potential public-health benefits, our results indicate that the hypothesis deserves further attention and should not be hastily dismissed.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni Sala","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"},{"author_name":"Rik Chakraborti","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Christopher Newport University"},{"author_name":"Atsuhiko Ota","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tsuyoshi Miyakawa","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20048090","rel_title":"COVID-19 related social distancing measures and reduction in city mobility","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20048090","rel_abs":"In the absence of any pharmacological intervention, one approach to slowing the COVID-19 pandemic is reducing the contact rate in the population through social distancing.

Leaving the economy locked down for a long time is its own catastrophe. An SIR-type model with clear parameters suitable for public information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities which learns disease spread characteristics rapidly as policy changes, suggests that a solution to the problem is a partial unlock. Case load can be managed so as not to exceed critical resources such as ventilators, yet allow enough people to get sick that herd immunity develops and a full unlock can be achieved in as little as five weeks from beginning of implementation. The partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week. Given that not all areas or individuals will respond, and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely, the partial unlock might be 5 full working days per week. The model can be regionalized easily, and by expediting the resolution of the pandemic in the U.S. medical equipment and volunteers, many of them with already acquired immunity, can be made available to other countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert L Shuler","author_inst":"Shuler Research (former NASA JSC)"},{"author_name":"Chandra Couzens","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Tsuyoshi Miyakawa","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20051334","rel_title":"Rapid implementation of mobile technology for real-time epidemiology of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20051334","rel_abs":"The rapid pace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic (COVID-19) presents challenges to the robust collection of population-scale data to address this global health crisis.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains allows for the reconstruction of transmission history connecting these infections. Here, we analyze 346 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples collected between 20 February and 15 March 2020 from infected patients in Washington State, USA. We found that the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections sampled during this time frame appeared to have derived from a single introduction event into the state in late January or early February 2020 and subsequent local spread, strongly suggesting cryptic spread of COVID-19 during the months of January and February 2020, before active community surveillance was implemented. We estimate a common ancestor of this outbreak clade as occurring between 18 January and 9 February 2020. From genomic data, we estimate an exponential doubling between 2.4 and 5.1 days. These results highlight the need for large-scale community surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 introductions and spread and the power of pathogen genomics to inform epidemiological understanding.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander L.

We propose a method for predicting both ICU requirements and the number of deaths, and which will enable the health authorities of the countries involved to plan the resources needed to face the pandemic as many days in advance as possible. Methods We use official Spanish data to predict ICU admissions and deaths based on the number of infections. We employ OLS to perform the econometric estimation, and through RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE forecast performance measures we select the best lagged predictor of both dependent variables. Findings For Spain, our prediction shows that the best predictor of ICU admissions is the number of people infected eight days before, and that the best predictor of deaths is the number of people infected five days before. In the first case, we obtain a 98% coefficient of determination, and in the second a 97% coefficient. The estimated delayed elasticities find that a 1% increase in the number of cases today will imply a 0.72% increase in ICU patients eight days later and a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths five days later. Interpretation The model is not intended to analyse the epidemiology of COVID-19. Our objective is rather to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs. Having a forecast model available several days in advance can enable governments to more effectively face the gap between needs and resources triggered by the outbreak and thus reduce the deaths caused by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Angel Hierro-Recio","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Antonio Jose Garzon-Gordon","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Pedro Atienza-Montero","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Marquez","author_inst":"Virgen del Rocio Hospital (Seville-Spain)"},{"author_name":"Francois Roger","author_inst":"ASTRE"},{"author_name":"Yann Kerr","author_inst":"CESBIO"},{"author_name":"Arun Nalla","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Gregory Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Adam Reinhardt","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hong Xie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast epidemics, classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here, we propose a data-driven, parameter-free, geometric approach to access the emergence of a pandemic state by studying the Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci network curvatures. Discrete Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can provide analogous results for COVID-19 epidemic time-series. We first compute both curvatures in a toy-model of epidemic time-series with delays, which allows us to create epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures can be a parameter-free estimate for identifying a pandemic state in the simulated epidemic. On this basis, we then compute both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures for real epidemic networks built from COVID-19 epidemic time-series available at the World Health Organization (WHO). Both curvatures allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of our method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for the pandemic state, regardless of parameter estimation and stochastic modelling. This work opens the possibility of using discrete geometry to study epidemic networks.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danillo Barros de Souza","author_inst":"Departamento de Matematica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife-Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jonatas T.

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raj Dandekar","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"George Barbastathis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Everlon Figueiroa","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Imunopatologia Keizo Asami  (LIKA)  -

Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs. In light of the limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified in this study represent important targets for future interventions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignacio Ricci Cabello","author_inst":"Institut d'Investigacio Sanitaria Illes Balears"},{"author_name":"Jose F Meneses Echavez","author_inst":"Division for Health Services, Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

The clinical evidence to date suggests that pregnant and childbearing women, and their babies are not at increased risk of either getting infected, or of having severe symptoms or consequences than the population as a whole. There is no evidence on the short- and longer-term psychological impacts of restrictive practices or social and personal constraints for childbearing women during COVID-19 in particular, or infection pandemics in general. The potential for adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic should be recognised as a critical public health concern, together with appropriate care and support to prevent and ameliorate any negative impacts.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anastasia Topalidou","author_inst":"THRIVE Centre, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire, UK"},{"author_name":"Gill Thomson","author_inst":"THRIVE Centre, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire, UK"},{"author_name":"Soo Downe","author_inst":"THRIVE Centre, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fraile-Navarro","author_inst":"Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Maria Antonia Fiol de Roque","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa), Palma, Illes Balears, Spain"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe Pastor Moreno","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red (CIBERESP)"},{"author_name":"Adoracion Castro","author_inst":"Research Institute of Health Sciences (IUNICS)"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ruiz Perez","author_inst":"Escuela Andaluza de Salud Publica"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

We applied CovProfile to 11 samples, each from a terminally ill patient, and discovered that all the patients are infected by multiple viral strains, which might affect the reliability of phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, the expression of viral genes ORF1ab gene, S gene, M gene, and N gene are high among most of the samples.

Furthermore, patients infected with similar strains (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) suffered testis, liver, or thyroid damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection. Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database). The list of organs where genes sharing local over-expression with the ACE2 gene are the most expressed is astonishingly similar to the organs affected by Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colline Lapina","author_inst":"Ecole Nationale Superieure de Cognitique"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Rodic","author_inst":"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique"},{"author_name":"Denis Peschanski","author_inst":"Universite Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne Institut des Sciences Juridique et Philosophique de la Sorbonne"},{"author_name":"SALMA MESMOUDI","author_inst":"Paris1 university"},{"author_name":"Wenlong Jia","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yiqi Jiang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Shuai Cheng Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, we focused on the sister virus SARS-CoV-1. We propose a two-step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS-CoV-2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for [&ge;]4 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 G B Derraik","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"William A Anderson","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth A Connelly","author_inst":"Taranaki District Health Board"},{"author_name":"Yvonne C Anderson","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Wenlong Jia","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yiqi Jiang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Shuai Cheng Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

The infectious disease has spread globally and become a major threat to public health. Purpose: We aim to investigate the ultra-high-resolution CT (UHR-CT) findings of imported COVID-19 related pneumonia from the initial diagnosis to early-phase follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study included confirmed cases with early-stage COVID-19 related pneumonia imported from the epicenter. Initial and early-phase follow-up UHR-CT scans (within 5 days) were reviewed for characterizing the radiological findings. The normalized total volumes of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were calculated and compared during the radiological follow-up by artificial-intelligence-based methods. Results: Eleven patients (3 males and 8 females, aged 32-74 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. Subpleural GGOs with inter\/intralobular septal thickening were typical imaging findings. Other diagnostic CT features included distinct margins (8\/11, 73%), pleural retraction or thickening (7\/11, 64%), intralesional vasodilatation (6\/11, 55%). Normalized volumes of pulmonary GGOs (p=0.003) and consolidations (p=0.003) significantly increased during the CT follow-up. Conclusions: The abnormalities of GGOs with peripleural distribution, consolidated areas, septal thickening, pleural involvement and intralesional vasodilatation on UHR-CT indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19. COVID-19 cases could manifest significantly progressed GGOs and consolidations with increased volume during the early-phase CT follow-up.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaomao Lv","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jinan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jianghe Kang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Youbin Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhipeng Feng","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Shuai Cheng Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

The long duration of pathological laboratory tests and the wrong test results led the researchers to focus on different fields. Fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for effective interventions with COVID-19. The information obtained by using X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images is vital in making clinical diagnoses. Therefore it was aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray images. In this study, images belonging to 6 situations, including coronavirus images, are classified. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, it is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods. For this purpose, firstly, all the images in the dataset are extracted with the help of four feature extraction algorithms. These extracted features are combined in raw form. The unbalanced data problem is eliminated by producing feature vectors with the SMOTE algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially in order to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saban Ozturk","author_inst":"Amasya University"},{"author_name":"Umut Ozkaya","author_inst":"Konya Technical University"},{"author_name":"Mucahid Barstugan","author_inst":"Konya Technical University"},{"author_name":"Jianghe Kang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Youbin Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhipeng Feng","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Shuai Cheng Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

We asked 356 participants: (1) In your opinion, how likely is it that the spread of COVID-19 (the coronavirus) will cause a public health crisis in the United States? (2) How concerned are you that you will contract COVID-19 by attending events on campus? Participants' estimates of an impending national health crisis increased significantly during the study's second week (March 9-12) while concern about personally contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events increased only marginally during the study's final days. We find those expressing a higher likelihood of an impending national crisis were more concerned about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events, suggesting a possible transmission from perceptions of national-level events to perceived personal vulnerability via local exposure. However, about 30% of participants perceived that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis yet did not express concern about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more likely to be younger students who agreed to participate in response to recruitment using same-day flyer distribution. Women expressed a higher likelihood of an emerging national health crisis, although they were not more concerned than men that attending campus events would result in virus contraction. Other groups (e.g., white, students younger than 25, highest income group) displayed similar concern about a national-level crisis, yet were significantly less concerned about contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events than others. Also, participants randomly assigned to information emphasizing the national impacts of food waste expressed significantly greater concern of contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events. These results provide some initial insight about how people perceived national and personal risks in the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis in Louisiana.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ran Li","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Bingchen Yang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-see University"},{"author_name":"Jerrod Penn","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Bailey Houghtaling","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Witoon Prinyawiwatkul","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Brian Roe","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Danyi Qi","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Rocio Zamanillo Campos","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Daniela Goncalves-Bradley","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lasata Shrestha","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Truong N Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Shari Cho","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Danielle Giroux","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris D Frazar","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Misja Ilcisin","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anahita Kiavand","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Richardson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Sibley","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Truong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Rieder","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"- the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"James Hadfield","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emma B Hodcroft","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Louise H Moncla","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicola F M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Richard A Neher","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charles Chiu","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health -

For individuals, information can help us make personal decisions and provide a sense of security. For the global community, information can inform policy decisions and offer critical insights into the epidemic of COVID-19 disease. Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics. These sources may include self-reported health status through surveys (including mobile apps), results of diagnostic laboratory tests, and other static and real-time geospatial data. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak, identifying which factors control the rate of spreading, informing immediate policy decisions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control, and providing critical insight on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help individuals stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease. In the past few weeks, several initiatives across the globe have surfaced to use daily self-reported symptoms as a means to track disease spread, predict outbreak locations, guide population measures and help in the allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this paper is to put out a call to standardize these efforts and spark a collaborative effort to maximize the global gain while protecting participant privacy.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Core Member, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, United States"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Departments of Biostatistics and Statistics, Harvard T.H.

The Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long-term efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and high-income countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in LMICs, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in LMICs.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anita Shet","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USA"},{"author_name":"Debashree Ray","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USA"},{"author_name":"Neelika Malavige","author_inst":"University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Mathuram Santosham","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Naor Bar-Zeev","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"William E.

To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings. METHODS: We included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies. RESULTS: Where specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI\/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I2 29%, low certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 2 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person(OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I2 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence). DISCUSSION: Based on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julii Suzanne Brainard","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Natalia Jones","author_inst":"School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Iain Lake","author_inst":"School of Environmental Science, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Lee Hooper","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Paul Hunter","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, and Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"William E.

This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the 16th month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. The average containment level is approximately 50\\% during the 25-months period for vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly outperforms others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak. This work opens new perspectives to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics, and be used as a proof-of-concept in using mathematical modelling techniques to enlighten decision making and public health management in the early times of an outbreak.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramses Djidjou-Demasse","author_inst":"The French National Research Institute for Development (IRD)"},{"author_name":"Yannis Michalakis","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Marc Choisy","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Mircea T.

The six (6) top countries (excluding China) most affected so far include; USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and Iran. With Italy showing the highest death toll. In Uganda where it was discovered on 19\/3\/2020 with one (01) case has just in nine (9) days, increased to thirty (30) infected individuals. This model is a wake-up call over the rate at which COVID-19 is likely to spread throughout the country.

Several reports suggest that, in severe cases, COVID-19 may cause a hyperinflammatory 'cytokine storm'. However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID- 19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. Although mHLA-DR expression levels in COVID-19 patients were lower than those observed in healthy subjects, the extent of suppression was less pronounced than observed in bacterial septic shock patients. mHLA-DR expression kinetics revealed no change over time. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate more moderate innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients compared with bacterial septic shock patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears less pronounced in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthijs Kox","author_inst":"Radboud university medical centre"},{"author_name":"Tim Frenzel","author_inst":"Radboud university medical center"},{"author_name":"Jeroen Schouten","author_inst":"Radboud university medical center"},{"author_name":"Frank van de Veerdonk","author_inst":"Radboud university medical center"},{"author_name":"Hans J.P.M.

Knowledge about Aerosol spread is vital during the SARS-CoV-2-Pandemic. Methods: To evaluate feasibility we nebulized ultraviolet sensitive detergents into the artificial airway of a resuscitation dummy and performed CPR. The spread of the visualized aerosol was documented by a camera. In a second approach we applied nebulized detergents into human cadavers by an endotracheal tube and detected aerosol- spread during chest compressions the same way. We did recordings with undergoing compression- only-CPR, with a surgical mask and with an inserted laryngeal tube with and without a connected airway filter. Results: Most aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask deflected the spread. Inserting a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter lead to a remarkable reduction of aerosol-spread. Conclusion: The early insertion of a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter before starting chest compression may be good for two Things: the treatment of hypoxemia as the likeliest cause of cardiac arrest and for staff protection during CPR.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthias Ott","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfio Milazzo","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy & Developmental Biology INDB, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Stefan Liebau","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy & Developmental Biology INDB, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Christina Jaki","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Simulation Center STUPS"},{"author_name":"Tobias Schilling","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Krohn","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Johannes Heymer","author_inst":"Klinikum Stuttgart, Department of interdisciplinary emergency and intensive care medicine"},{"author_name":"Yonatan H.
