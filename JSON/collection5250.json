KD is a major cause of childhood acquired heart disease and vasculitis in the pediatric population. Epidemiological patterns suggest KD is related to an infectious agent; however, the etiology remains unknown1. As past reports have considered other coronaviruses to be related to KD2,3, these reports of pediatric COVID-19 related inflammatory disorder cases leads to the hypothesis of potential cross-coronavirus reactivity that would account for the past controversial proposals of other coronaviruses and these new cases. We sought to address this hypothesis by assessing the antigen targeting of biobanked plasma samples of febrile children, including those with KD, against SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arthur Chang","author_inst":"University at Buffalo"},{"author_name":"Michael Croix","author_inst":"University at Buffalo"},{"author_name":"Patrick Kenney","author_inst":"University at Buffalo"},{"author_name":"Sarah Baron","author_inst":"University at Buffalo"},{"author_name":"Mark Hicar","author_inst":"University at Buffalo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20107599","rel_title":"Clinical Utility of SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing in Deciphering Source of Infection","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20107599","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a major threat to humans. Recently, we encountered two seemingly separate COVID-19 clusters in a tertiary care medical center. Whole viral genome sequencing detected the haplotype of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the two clusters were successfully distinguished by the viral genome haplotype. Concurrently, there were nine COVID-19 patients clinically unlinked to clusters #1 or #2 that necessitated the determination of the source of infection. Such patients had similar haplotypes to that in cluster #2 but were devoid of two rare mutations characteristic to cluster #2. This suggested that these nine cases of \"probable community infection\" indeed had community infection and were not derived from cluster #2.

During infectious disease outbreaks the weakest communities are more vulnerable to the infection and its deleterious effects. In Israel, the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have unique demographic and cultural characteristics that place them at risk for infection. Objective. To examine the socioeconomic and ethnic differences in relation to COVID-19 testing, cases and deaths, and to analyze infection spread patterns in ethnically diverse communities. Methods. Consecutive data on COVID-19 diagnostic testing, confirmed cases and deaths collected from March 31st through May 1st, 2020 in 174 localities across Israel (84% of the population) were analyzed by socioeconomic ranking and ethnicity. Findings. Tests were performed on 331,594 individuals (4.29% of the total population). Of those, 14,865 individuals (4.48%) were positive and 203 died (1.37% of confirmed cases). The percentage of the population tested was 26% and the risk of testing positive was 2.16 times higher in the lowest, compared with the highest socioeconomic category. The proportion of confirmed cases was 4.96 times higher in the Jewish compared with the Arab population. The rate of confirmed cases in 2 Ultra-Orthodox localities increased relatively early and quickly. Other Jewish and Arab localities showed consistently low rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of socioeconomic ranking. Interpretation Culturally different communities reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak and to government measures, resulting in different outcomes. Therefore, socioeconomic and ethnic variables cannot fully explain communities reaction to the pandemic. Our findings stress the need for designing a culturally adapted approach for dealing with health crises.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mor Saban","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Epidemiology & Health Policy Research"},{"author_name":"Tal Shachar","author_inst":"Bar ilan university"},{"author_name":"Oren Miron","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheba, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rachel Wilf Meron","author_inst":"Gertner Institue of Epidemiology & Health Policy Research"},{"author_name":"Yoshifumi Uwamino","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shunsuke Uno","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Asami Osada","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naoki Hasegawa","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mitsuru Murata","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Toru Takebayashi","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Koichi Fukunaga","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hideyuki Saya","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuko Kitagawa","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Amagai","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haruhiko Siomi","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenjiro Kosaki","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20107607","rel_title":"Chansu Injection Improves the Respiratory Function of Severe COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20107607","rel_abs":"Chansu and its major active constituent of bufalin have been reported to have broad-spectrum antiviral effects.

Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine-tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers\/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3' end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene\/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3' end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer\/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated. The genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the early identification of mutations in critical regions and to issue recommendations on specific diagnostic tests to ensure the coverage of locally-circulating genetic variants.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Alejandro Alvarez-Diaz","author_inst":"Grupo de Salud Materna y Perinatal.

The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns in addition to clinical conditions needing treatment. Wherever ventilators are employed, additional tubing and splitting adaptors may be available. Adjustable flow-compensating resistance for differences in lung compliance on individual limbs may not be readily implementable. By exploring a number and range of possible contributing factors using computational simulation without risk of patient harm, this paper attempts to define useful bounds for ventilation parameters when compensatory resistance in limbs of a shared breathing circuit is not possible. This desperate approach to shared ventilation support would be a last resort when alternatives have been exhausted. Methods - A whole-body computational physiology model (using lumped parameters) was used to simulate each patient being ventilated. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. In addition to lung mechanics or estimation of CO2and pH expected for set ventilation parameters (considerations of lung physiology alone), full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. Findings - To be useful for clinicians, attention has been directed to clinically available parameters. These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and end-tidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 mL\/cmH2O, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. Interpretation - In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if that option is unavailable and ventilator sharing using limbs without flow resistance compensation is the only available alternative, these simulations provide a conceptual framework and guidelines for clinical patient selection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey B.

At the same time, the imaging features of CT in confirmed COVID-19 patients would be summarized. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of 5 electronic databases was performed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated using the random-effects model and the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. We also conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled incidence of the chest CT imaging findings and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. Results: Overall, 25 articles comprising 4,857 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity of CT was 93% (95% CI, 89-96%) and specificity was 44% (95% CI, 27-62%). The area under the SROC curve was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96). For the RT-PCR assay, the pooled sensitivity of the initial test and the missed diagnosis rate after the second-round test were 76% (95% CI: 59-89%; I2=96%) and 26% (95% CI: 14-39%; I2=45%), respectively. According to the subgroup analysis, the diagnostic sensitivity of CT in Hubei was higher than that in other regions. Besides, the most common patterns on CT imaging finding was ground glass opacities (GGO) 58% (95% CI: 49-70%), followed by air bronchogram 51% (95% CI: 31-70%).

Data extraction and synthesis: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and OpenGrey from inception to 1st April 2020. Methodological quality was assessed using the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies and Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies. Results: We screened 3,360 titles and included 112 studies with 21 different drug classes identified as influencing ACE2 activity. Ten studies were in humans and 102 were in animal models None examined ACE2 in human lungs. The most frequently examined drugs were Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) (n= 55) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme- Inhibitors (ACE-I) (n= 22). More studies reported upregulation than downregulation with ACE-I (n=22), ARBs (n=55), insulin (n=8), thiazolidinedione (n=7) aldosterone agonists (n=3), statins (n=5), oestrogens (n=5) calcium channel-blockers (n=3) GLP-1 agonists (n=2) and NSAIDs (n=2). Conclusions: There is an abundance of academic literature and media reports on the potential of drugs that could attenuate or exacerbate COVID-19 disease. This is leading to trials of repurposed drugs and uncertainty amongst patients and clinicians concerning continuation or cessation of prescribed medications. Our review indicates that the impact of currently prescribed drugs on ACE2 has been poorly studied in-vivo, particularly in human lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to enact its pathogenic effects. We found no convincing evidence to justify starting or stopping currently prescribed drugs to influence outcomes of COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hajira Dambha-Miller","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ali Albasri","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sam Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Wilcox","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Shareen Khan","author_inst":"Oxford Health Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nazrul Nazrul Islam","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Little","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Simon J Griffin","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Juliana Barbosa-Ramirez","author_inst":"Grupo de Virologia, Direccion de Redes en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Erika X Ospitia-Baez","author_inst":"Grupo de Virologia, Direccion de Redes en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Diana M Walteros","author_inst":"Direccion de Vigilancia en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Martha L Ospina Martinez","author_inst":"Direccion General, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Marcela Mercado-Reyes","author_inst":"Direccion de Investigacion en Salud Publica, Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Amagai","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haruhiko Siomi","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenjiro Kosaki","author_inst":"Keio University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108704","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Measuring differences in individual precautionary behaviors among young adults","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108704","rel_abs":"Aim: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already hit Bangladesh, and various control measures have been taken to flatten the epidemic curve. Due to the current demographic distribution in Bangladesh, young adults are vital to the demography of the country. Therefore, their precautionary behavior is very important to ensure the success of preventive policies. This exploratory study examined the differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors among young adults, and estimated and compared the predictors of precautionary behavior adoption among young adults living in the capital city Dhaka and a nearby district, Tangail. Subject and Methods: A total of 350 respondents from each district participated in the study. ANOVA and two-sample t-tests were utilized to detect differences in precautionary behavior across demographic groups of young adults, and quantile regression modeling was used to find the predictors of adopting precautionary behaviors and to compare these predictors between the two districts. Results: Individuals who had a postgraduate education and had good mental health tended to show better precautionary behaviors in Dhaka. Female respondents from Tangail who had no psychological distress took precautionary behaviors more often than their counterparts. However, no significant differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among young adults were found between the two districts. Better self-control ability, higher education, and good mental health emerged as factors that significantly shaped the precautionary behaviors of young adults in this study. Conclusion: Having better knowledge did not ensure better adoption of precautionary behaviors among the participants. In effect, strong intervention by the government to keep people at home and distant from each other and continued lockdown for several more days are probable immediate solutions. At the same time, the economic burden on lower-income people should be addressed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Imtiaz","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Md.

Methods Building upon previous work, automated HRCT measures of small blood vessel volume and pulmonary vascular density were developed. Scans from 103 COVID-19 patients and 108 healthy volunteers were analyzed and their results compared, with comparisons made both on lobar and global levels. Results Compared to healthy volunteers, COVID-19 patients showed significant reduction in BV5 (pulmonary blood volume contained in blood vessels of <5 mm2) expressed as BV5\/(Total pulmonary blood volume) (p<0.0001), and significant increases in BV5_10 and BV 10 (pulmonary blood volumes contained in vessels between 5 and 10 mm2 and above 10 mm2, respectively) (p<0.0001). These changes were consistent across lobes.

Methods The first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection case in Wuhan was admitted in hospital for quarantine and observation. The T cell responses were followed up by flow cytometry analysis of the peripheral blood nonnuclear cells (PBMCs) at days 7, 13, 22, and 28 after admission. Findings We found the first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan is an asymptomatic case. His T cell differentiation, proliferation and activation matched the classical kinetics of T cell responses induced by viral infection, but the activation maintained at a relatively low level. Function analysis indicated frequencies of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were notably lower than that of the healthy controls (HC) at day 7, and then rebound gradually. But IFN-{gamma}+CD8+ T cells were detained at a significant lower level even at day 28, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus had already become undetectable for 3 weeks. Moreover, percentage of IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells was also detained constantly at a much lower level compared to HC. At day 7, although percentage of Tregs was in normal range, the frequency of activated Treg (aTreg) was remarkably as high as 4.4-fold of that in HC. Interpretation The T cell activation in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a significant suppression and presented impairment of Th1\/Th17 and CD8+ T cell functions. Early elevation of the aTregs might play role in the activation and function of T cells in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingyi Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Ejuan Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Maohua Zhong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),"},{"author_name":"Qingyu Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ke Hong","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ting Shu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Dihan Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Xia","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Dingyu Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chaolin Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"You Shang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huimin Yan","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard J Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111724","rel_title":"COVID-19: Impact of Obesity and Diabetes in Disease Severity","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111724","rel_abs":"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic is straining the healthcare system, particularly for patients with severe outcomes who require admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to investigate the potential associations of obesity and diabetes with COVID19 severe outcomes, assessed as ICU admittance. Subjects: Demographic and patient characteristics from a retrospective cohort of 1158 patients hospitalized with COVID19 in a single center in Kuwait, along with their medical history, were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations between different variables and ICU admittance. Results: From the 1158 hospitalized patients, 271 (23.4%) had diabetes, 236 (20.4%) had hypertension and 104 (9%) required admittance into the ICU. From patients with available measurements, 157 (21.6%) had body mass index (BMI)[&ge;]25 kg\/m2. Univariate analysis showed that overweight (BMI=25.0~29.9 kg\/m2), obesity class I (BMI=30~34.9 kg\/m2) and morbid obesity (BMI[&ge;]40 kg\/m2) associated with ICU admittance (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 2.45 [1.26~4.74] p value=0.008; OR [95% CI]: 3.51 [1.60~7.69] p value=0.002; and OR [95% CI]: 5.18 [1.50~17.85] p value=0.009], respectively). Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to ICU (OR [95% CI]: 9.38 [5.49~16.02]). Two models for multivariate regression analysis were used, assessing either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I obesity and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance (adjusted OR (AOR) [95% CI]: 2.7 [1.17~6.20] p value=0.019 and AOR [95% CI]: 3.95 [1.00~15.20] p value=0.046, respectively). In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with higher ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 5.49 [3.13~9.65] p value<0.001) whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 0.51 (0.28-0.91). Conclusions: In our cohort, overweight, obesity and diabetes in patients with COVID19 were associated with ICU admittance, putting these patients at higher risk of poor outcomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Salman K.

Our study objective was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada. Methods: Data sources consisted of two distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and testing across respondent groups. Results: We found that 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canada-wide respondents had a symptom in the previous month over March-April 2020. Across the three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic responses. Women, younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous\/First nations\/Inuit\/Metis were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath. Interpretation: The low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of current SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren Lapointe-Shaw","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Rader","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Christina M.

Methods: We performed a cohort analysis of consecutive COVID-19 hospital admissions at 5 Johns Hopkins hospitals in the Baltimore\/DC area between March 4 and April 24, 2020. Disease severity and outcomes were classified using the WHO COVID-19 disease severity ordinal scale. Cox proportional-hazards regressions were performed to assess relationships between demographics, clinical features and progression to severe disease or death. Results: 832 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized; 633 (76.1%) were discharged, 113 (13.6%) died, and 85 (10.2%) remained hospitalized. Among those discharged, 518 (82%) had mild\/moderate and 116 (18%) had severe illness. Mortality was statistically significantly associated with increasing age per 10 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.54; 95%CI 1.28-1.84), nursing home residence (aHR 2.13, 95%CI 1.41-3.23), Charlson comorbidity index (1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.26), respiratory rate (aHR 1.13; 95%CI 1.09-1.17), D-dimer greater than 1mg\/dL (aHR 2.79; 95% 1.53-5.09), and detectable troponin (aHR 2.79; 95%CI 1.53-5.09).

An online survey was conducted among a sample of 393 community pharmacists from two provinces; Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during a period of strict lockdown (10th to 30th April 2020). A validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) self-administered questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, source of information, knowledge, attitude, and practice) was used for data collection. Logistic regression was applied to find potential factors associated with good knowledge, attitude, and practice by using SPSS version 21. Of total 393 participants, 71.5% (n=281) had good knowledge, 44% (n=175) had positive attitude and 57.3% (n=225) had good practice regarding COVID-19. Social media (45.29%, n=178) was reported as the main source to seek information regarding COVID-19. Results revealed that the age of [&ge;]26 years, Ph.D. degree level, and good knowledge were the substantial determinants (P<0.05) of a good attitude. Similarly, community pharmacist who had an experience of >5 years, hold a Ph.D. degree, good knowledge and good attitude had higher odds of good practice compared to reference categories (P<0.05). The findings demonstrated that the majority of community pharmacists had good knowledge, but had a poor attitude and practice towards the COVID-19. This study also highlighted the disparity in some aspects of knowledge, attitude, and practice that must be addressed in future educational, awareness, and counselling programs.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khayal Muhammad","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Comsat University, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Saqlain","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ataullah Hamdard","author_inst":"Faculty of Art and Sciences, Department of Statistics, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Naveed","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Farooq Umer","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Siraj Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Kamran","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Haroon Rashid","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Sohail Kamran","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ijaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Anbar-23561, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Faiz Ullah Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Health Science Centre, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Hussain","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Zakir Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacology (Pharmacovigilance), Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey\/Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University"},{"author_name":"Eric D Dobkin","author_inst":"Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renee Blanding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Abele","author_inst":"Sibley Memorial Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Woods","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Harkness","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David R Thiemann","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Grace Bowring","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aalok B.

The effective reproduction number Re(t) is a critical measure of epidemic potential. Re(t) can be calculated in near real time using an incidence time series and the generation time distribution---the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. In calculating Re(t), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the serial interval distribution---the time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair. However, while generation time must be positive by definition, serial interval can be negative if transmission can occur before symptoms, such as in COVID-19, rendering such an approximation improper in some contexts. METHODS. We developed a method to infer the generation time distribution from parametric definitions of the serial interval and incubation period distributions. We then compared estimates of Re(t) for COVID-19 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada using: negative-permitting versus non-negative serial interval distributions, versus the inferred generation time distribution. RESULTS. We estimated the generation time of COVID-19 to be Gamma-distributed with mean 3.99 and standard deviation 2.96 days. Relative to the generation time distribution, non-negative serial interval distribution caused overestimation of Re(t) due to larger mean, while negative-permitting serial interval distribution caused underestimation of Re(t) due to larger variance. IMPLICATIONS. Approximation of the generation time distribution of COVID-19 with non-negative or negative-permitting serial interval distributions when calculating Re(t) may result in over or underestimation of transmission potential, respectively.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesse Knight","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Huihui Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Li","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shubing Zhang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuanhong Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haroon Rashid","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Sohail Kamran","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ijaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Anbar-23561, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Faiz Ullah Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Health Science Centre, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Hussain","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Zakir Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacology (Pharmacovigilance), Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey\/Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University"},{"author_name":"Eric D Dobkin","author_inst":"Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renee Blanding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Abele","author_inst":"Sibley Memorial Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Woods","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Harkness","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David R Thiemann","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Grace Bowring","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aalok B.

Methods This review was guided by specific methodological framework and reporting items (PRISMA-ScR). We included studies, cases and grey literature regarding prone position and CPR\/cardiac arrest. The databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus and Google Scholar. Expanded grey literature searching included internet search engine, targeted websites and social media. Results Of 453 identified studies, 24 (5%) studies met our inclusion criteria. There were four prone resuscitation-relevant studies examining: blood and tidal volumes generated by prone compressions; prone compression quality metrics on a manikin; and chest computed tomography scans for compression landmarking. Twenty case reports\/series described the resuscitation of 25 prone patients. Prone compression quality was assessed by invasive blood pressure monitoring, exhaled carbon dioxide and pulse palpation. Recommended compression location was zero-to-two vertebral segments below the scapulae. Twenty of 25 cases (80%) survived prone resuscitation, although few cases reported long term outcome. Seven cases described full neurological recovery. Conclusion This scoping review did not identify sufficient evidence to justify a systematic review or modified resuscitation guidelines. It remains reasonable to initiate resuscitation in the prone position if turning the patient supine would lead to delays or risk to providers or patients. Prone resuscitation quality can be judged using end-tidal CO2, and arterial pressure tracing, with patients turned supine if insufficient.

Some recent studies suggested an inverse correlation with BCG vaccination at population level, while others denied this hypothesis. In order to address this controversial issue, we performed a strict epidemiological study collecting data available on a global scale, considering additional variables such as cultural-political factors and adherence to other vaccination coverages. Methods: Data on 121 countries, accounting for about 99% of Covid-19 cases and deaths globally, were from John's Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations, Human Freedom Report, and BCG Atlas. Statistical models used were Ordinary Least Squares, Tobit and Fractional Probit, implemented on Stata\/MP16 software. Results: Based on our results, countries where BCG vaccination is or has been mandated in the last decades have seen a drastic reduction in Covid-19 diffusion (-80% on average) and mortality (-50% on average), even controlling for relative wealth of countries and their governmental health expenditure. A significant contribution to this reduction (respectively -50% and -13% on average) was also associated to the outbreak onset during summer, suggesting a possible influence of seasonality. Other variables turned out to be associated, though to a lesser extent. Conclusions: Relying on a very large dataset and a wide array of control variables, our study confirms a strong and robust association between Covid-19 diffusion and mortality with BCG vaccination and a set socio-economic factors, opening new perspectives for clinical speculations and public health policies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luigi Ventura","author_inst":"Department of Economy and Law, Sapienza University of Rome,  Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, University of Rome \u201cForo Italico\u201d, Rome Italy"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Christopher Picard","author_inst":"University of Alberta Faculty of Nursing & Covenant Health"},{"author_name":"Lazar Milovanovic","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Domhnall O'Dochartaigh","author_inst":"Edmonton Zone Emergency Departments, Alberta Health Services; Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."},{"author_name":"Peter G Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ijaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Anbar-23561, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Faiz Ullah Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Health Science Centre, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Hussain","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Zakir Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacology (Pharmacovigilance), Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey\/Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University"},{"author_name":"Eric D Dobkin","author_inst":"Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renee Blanding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Abele","author_inst":"Sibley Memorial Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Woods","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Harkness","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David R Thiemann","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Grace Bowring","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aalok B.

During the period from 2\/4\/2020 to 18\/5\/2020, a total of 219 blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collection of samples were divided in two categories; random samples from public community and samples from health care workers belong to two Governmental hospitals and one private clinic. One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM\/IgG Antibody Test was used. Out of the 219 samples tested, 6 (2.74%) samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. All health-care workers were tested negative. All positive cases were females and 5 of them aged between 44 to 75 years and one aged 32 years. The prevalence in young females ([&le;]40 years) was 1.4% in total young females tested in the study and 1.75% in young females taken from public community. The prevalence in older females aged ( 40 years), was 11.1% in total females tested and 13.9% in females taken from public community. In conclusion, the preliminary investigation of SARS-CoV-2 revealed considerable prevalence in Alzintan City although the disease seems to be in its mild form. Active surveillance studies with high number of samples using both virological and serological tests are in urgent need.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ABDULWAHAB M.
