The factors that are considered for the effective reuse of these masks are the fit, filter efficiency and decontamination\/disinfection level both for SARS-CoV2, which is the causative virus for COVID-19, and for other organisms of concern in the hospital environment such as Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile. The efficacy of inactivation or eradication against various pathogens should be evaluated thoroughly to understand the level of afforded disinfection. Methods commonly used in the sterilization of medical devices such as ionizing radiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and ethylene oxide can provide a high level of disinfection, defined as a 6 log10 reduction, against bacterial spores, considered the most resistant microorganisms. CDC guidance on the decontamination and reuse of N95s also includes the use of moist heat (60{degrees}C, 80% relative humidity, 15-30 min) as a possible recommendation based on literature showing preservation of fit efficiency and inactivation of H1N1 on spiked masks. Here, we explored the efficacy of using moist heat under these conditions as a decontamination method for an N95 respirator (3M 1860S, St. Paul, MN) against various pathogens with different resistance; enveloped RNA viruses, Gram (+\/-) bacteria, and non-enveloped viruses.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ebru Oral","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Keith K Wannomae","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Gil","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Rachel L Connolly","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joseph Gardecki","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Min Leung","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Orhun K Muratoglu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Amy Tsurumi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Laurence G Rahme","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Tareq Jaber","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Cassidy Collins","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Amanda Budzilowicz","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Julian Gjore","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20100602","rel_title":"Can we use these masks? Rapid Assessment of the Inhalation Resistance Performance of Uncertified Medical Face Masks in the Context of Restricted Resources Imposed during a Public Health Emergency","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20100602","rel_abs":"In the case of a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, access to large quantities of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) has presented a significant problem. A shortage of face masks and respirators has been widely reported across the world. A concerted effort to manufacture high volumes has not unsurprisingly put pressure on the supply chain and the important certification processes. PPE procured or donated as uncertified stock requires rigorous, expedient and scientifically informed evidence before decisions can be made regarding suitable deployment, expensive certification, return or possible destruction of stock. This paper reports a series of experiments devised in reaction to this situation. In this study, an experimental methodology for the assessment of the filtration performance of samples of real-world, uncertified, fluid resistant surgical masks (FRSM type IIR) was evaluated in the resource limited (lockdown) environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady-state flow rig was adapted to incorporate a bespoke filter flow chamber for mounting face masks in order to evaluate the resistance to air flow as an indicator of mask inhalation performance. Pure air was drawn through a specified control surface area at known flow rate conditions; the resistance to the air flow through the masks was measured as the resulting pressure drop. Over 60 tests were performed from 4 different, randomly sampled batches and compared to a control sample of EN Type IIR certified FRSM masks. Steady-state volumetric airflow rates of 30 and 95 lmin-1 were chosen to represent deep breathing and vigorous exercise conditions respectively. The results showed that the sample masks produced a pressure drop of between 26% to 58% compared to the control batch at the lower flow rate and 22% to 55% at the higher rate. The results for each sample were consistent across both flow rates. Within the group of masks tested, two sets (between 48% and 58% of the reference set) showed the potential to be professionally assessed for appropriate deployment in a suitable setting. Although the absolute values of pressure drop measured by this method are unlikely to correlate with other testing approaches, the observed, indicative trends and relative performance of the masks is key to this approach. Critically, this method does not replace certification but it has enabled a public body to quickly make decisions; certify, re-assign, refund, thus saving time and resources. The total time spent conducting the tests was less than 8 hours and the low cost method proposed can be repurposed for low resource regions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Begg","author_inst":"University of Brighton"},{"author_name":"Nwabueze G Emekwuru","author_inst":"Coventry University"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Miche","author_inst":"University of Brighton"},{"author_name":"Bill Whitney","author_inst":"University of Brighton"},{"author_name":"Obuks Ejohwomu","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hui Min Leung","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Orhun K Muratoglu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Amy Tsurumi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Laurence G Rahme","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Tareq Jaber","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Cassidy Collins","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Amanda Budzilowicz","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Julian Gjore","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101576","rel_title":"Characteristics and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients.","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101576","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Concerns have emerged about the higher risk of fatal COVID-19 in cancer patients. In this paper, we review the experience of a comprehensive cancer center. Methods: A prospective registry was set up at Institut Curie at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All cancer patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 were entered and actively followed for 28 days. Results: Among 9,842 patients treated at Institut Curie between mid-March and early May 2020, 141 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on RT-PCR testing and\/or CT-scan. In line with our case-mix, breast cancer (40%) was the most common tumor type, followed by hematological and lung malignancies (both 13%). Patients with active cancer therapy or\/and advanced cancer accounted for 88% and 69% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 79% of patients had COVID-19 related symptoms, with an extent of lung parenchyma involvement [&le;]50% in 90% of patients. Blood count variations and C-reactive protein elevation were the most common laboratory abnormalities. Antibiotics and antiviral agents were administered in 48% and 7% of patients, respectively. At the time of analysis, 26 patients (18%) have died from COVID-19, and 81 (57%) were cured. Independent prognostic factors at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis associated with death or intensive care unit admission were extent of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased O2 saturation. Conclusions: COVID-19 incidence and presentation in cancer patients appear to be very similar to those in the general population. The outcome of COVID-19 is primarily driven by the initial severity of infection rather than patient or cancer characteristics.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clemence Basse","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Sarah Diakite","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Vincent Servois","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Maxime Frelaut","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Noret","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Audrey Bellesoeur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Pauline Moreau","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Marie-Ange Massiani","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101808","rel_title":"Testing, tracing and isolation in compartmental models","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101808","rel_abs":"Existing compartmental mathematical modelling methods for epidemics, such as SEIR models, cannot accurately represent effects of contact tracing. This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computationally efficiency is such that it be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simone Sturniolo","author_inst":"Science and Technology Facilities Council, Swindon, UK"},{"author_name":"William Waites","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Tim Colbourn","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, UCL"},{"author_name":"David Manheim","author_inst":"University of Haifa Health and Risk Communication Research Center, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Audrey Bellesoeur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Pauline Moreau","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Marie-Ange Massiani","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101931","rel_title":"Development of a Predictive Score for COVID-19 Diagnosis based on Demographics and Symptoms in Patients Attended at a Dedicated Screening Unit","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101931","rel_abs":"Background: The diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical evaluation is difficult because symptoms often overlap with other respiratory diseases. A clinical score predictive of COVID-19 based on readily assessed variables may be useful in settings with restricted or no access to molecular diagnostic tests. Methods: A score based on demographics and symptoms was developed in a cross-sectional study including patients attended in a dedicated COVID-19 screening unit. A backward stepwise logistic regression model was constructed and values for each variable were assigned according to their {beta} coefficient values in the final model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and its area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: A total of 464 patients were included: 98 (21.1%) COVID-19 and 366 (78.9%) non-COVID-19 patients. The score included variables independently associated with COVID-19 in the final model: age equal or above 60 years (2 points), fever (2), dyspnea (1), fatigue (1 point) and coryza (-1). Score values were significantly higher in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients: median (Interquartile Range), 3 (2-4), and 1 (0-2), respectively; P<0.001. The score had an AUC of 0.80 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.76-0.86). The specificity of scores equal or greater than 4 and 5 points were 90.4 (95%CI, 87.0-93.3) and 96.2 (95%CI, 93.7-97.9), respectively. Conclusions: This preliminary score based on patients symptoms is a feasible tool that may be useful in setting with restricted or no access to molecular tests in a pandemic period, owing to the high specificity. Further studies are required to validate the score in other populations.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandre P Zavascki","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Marcelo B Gazzana","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Joao Pedro Bidart","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Patricia S Fernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Aline Galiotto","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101378","rel_title":"COVID-19 FATALITY RISK: WHY IS AUSTRALIA LOWER THAN SOUTH KOREA?","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101378","rel_abs":"Background: As the Covid-19 virus epidemic spreads, it is important to establish reliable estimates of fatality hazard rates.

Both have completed the first wave of the epidemic, they have extensive Covid-19 testing and tracking programs so that confirmed case load data are reliable, and neither country has had any significant case load stress in their hospital systems. Methods: For each country, mortality hazard models were estimated using a parameterized distributed lag model where the number of daily deaths was dependent on the number of confirmed cases in each of the preceding six weeks. Age cohort CFRs were also examined. Findings: We observed major difference in the mortality rates when comparing South Korea to Australia in both the simple age adjusted fatality rates and in the disease hazard curve. On a like-for-like basis, the CFR for South Korea appears to be close to double the Australian rate (aggregate; 2.4% vs 1.4%).

Methods Population studies with sample size of at least 500 and published as peer-reviewed papers or preprints as of July 11, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, preprint servers, and communications with experts. Studies on blood donors were included, but studies on healthcare workers were excluded. The studies were assessed for design features and seroprevalence estimates. Infection fatality rate was estimated from each study dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths at a relevant time point by the number of estimated people infected in each relevant region. Correction was also attempted accounting for the types of antibodies assessed. Secondarily, results from national studies were also examined from preliminary press releases and reports whenever a country had no other data presented in full papers of preprints. Results 36 studies (43 estimates) were identified with usable data to enter into calculations and another 7 preliminary national estimates were also considered for a total of 50 estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.222% to 47%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63% and corrected values ranged from 0.00% to 1.31%. Across 32 different locations, the median infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.24%). Most studies were done in pandemic epicenters with high death tolls. Median corrected IFR was 0.10% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rate less than the global average (<73 deaths per million as of July 12, 2020), 0.27% in locations with 73-500 COVID-19 deaths per million, and 0.90% in locations exceeding 500 COVID-19 deaths per million. Among people <70 years old, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.57% with median of 0.05% across the different locations (corrected median of 0.04%). Conclusions The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different locations and this may reflect differences in population age structure and case-mix of infected and deceased patients as well as multiple other factors. Estimates of infection fatality rates inferred from seroprevalence studies tend to be much lower than original speculations made in the early days of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"John Beggs","author_inst":"Monarch Institute, Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Joao Pedro Bidart","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Patricia S Fernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Aline Galiotto","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20101303","rel_title":"An integrated deterministic-stochastic approach for predicting the long-term trajectories of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20101303","rel_abs":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is one of the major health emergencies in decades that affected almost every country in the world. As of June 30, 2020, it has caused an outbreak with more than 10 million confirmed infections, and more than 500 thousand reported deaths globally. Due to the unavailability of an effective treatment (or vaccine) and insufficient evidence regarding the transmission mechanism of the epidemic, the world population is currently in a vulnerable position. The daily cases data sets of COVID-19 for profoundly affected countries represent a stochastic process comprised of deterministic and stochastic components. This study proposes an integrated deterministic-stochastic approach to forecast the long-term trajectories of the COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain. The deterministic component of the daily-cases univariate time-series is assessed by an extended version of the SIR (SIRCX) model, whereas its stochastic component is modeled using an autoregressive (AR) time series model. The proposed integrated SIRCX-AR (ISA) approach based on two operationally distinct modeling paradigms utilizes the superiority of both the deterministic SIRCX and stochastic AR models to find the long-term trajectories of the epidemic curves. Experimental analysis based on the proposed ISA model shows significant improvement in the long-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain in comparison to the ODE-based SIRCX model.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Indrajit Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Tanujit Chakraborty","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Joao Pedro Bidart","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Patricia S Fernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Aline Galiotto","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101352","rel_title":"Exploring alternative medicine options for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)- A systematic scoping review","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101352","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, pneumonia, and multi-organ failure. The infection spreads from one person to another via respiratory droplets. Alternative medicine (AMs) viz., Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are being promoted for the prevention of COVID-19. The aim of this systematic scoping review was to identify and summarize the scientific evidences promoting the use of AMs for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic search engines (PubMed and Web of Science) was performed. In addition, freewheeling searches of the government health ministries and government websites was done to retrieve the available information. Records available until 12th March 2020 were considered. Reports proposing the use of AMs for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 across all countries were included. Screening (primary and secondary) of the records and data extraction from the eligible studies were done by a single reviewer followed by a random quality check (10%) by the second reviewer. Results: Overall, 8 records (7 from China and 1 from India) exploring the use of AMs for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 were identified. Different medicines were explored by different AM systems. Conclusions: Several AMs options are proposed for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when. Methods We inferred transmission onset time from 72 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea, either with known or inferred contact dates by means of incubation period. Combining this data with known information of infector's symptom onset, we could generate the transmission onset distribution of COVID-19, using Bayesian methods. Serial interval distribution could be automatically estimated from our data. Results We estimated the median transmission onset to be 1.31 days (standard deviation, 2.64 days) after symptom onset with peak at 0.72 days before symptom onset. The pre-symptomatic transmission proportion was 37% (95% credible interval [CI], 16-52%). The median incubation period was estimated to be 2.87 days (95% CI, 2.33-3.50 days) and the median serial interval to be 3.56 days (95% CI, 2.72-4.44 days). Conclusions Considering the transmission onset distribution peaked with the symptom onset and the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion is substantial, the usual preventive measure might be too late to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"June Young Chun","author_inst":"National Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Gyuseung Baek","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Yongdai Kim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Patricia S Fernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Aline Galiotto","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20100537","rel_title":"Projecting Demand-Supply Gap of Hospital Capacity in India in the face of COVID-19 pandemic using Age-Structured Deterministic SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20100537","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Due to uncertainties encompassing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, mathematical models informing the trajectory of disease are being proposed throughout the world. Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess supply side preparedness in tandem with demand projections for comprehensive outlook. OBJECTIVE: Hence, we attempted this study to forecast the demand for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in demand due to COVID-19. METHODS: We employed age- structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the demand under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of mitigation strategies of a) No-lockdown b) Moderate-lockdown c) Full-lockdown. Correspondingly, data on a) General beds b) ICU beds and c) Ventilators was collated from various government records. Further, we computed the daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. FINDINGS: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in demand during peak of epidemic. Also, continuing strict lockdown measures was found to be ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly, rather would only push the peak by a month. However, augmented testing of 500,000 tests per day during peak (mid-July) under moderate lockdown scenario would lead to more reported cases (5,500,000-6,000,000), leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 10% public resources and 30% private resources would be required to commensurate with demand under that scenario. However, if the testing capacity is limited by 200,000 tests per day under same scenario, documented cases would plummet by half.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veenapani Rajeev Verma","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Madras"},{"author_name":"Anuraag Saini","author_inst":"Vantage Research"},{"author_name":"Sumirtha Gandhi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Madras"},{"author_name":"Umakant Dash","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Madras"},{"author_name":"Dr Muhammad Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101725","rel_title":"COVID-19 Epidemic Forecast in Different States of India using SIR Model","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101725","rel_abs":"The epidemiological data up to 12th May 2020 for India and its 24 states has been used to predict COVID-19 outbreak within classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model.

The population and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 infections are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that in addition to individual clinical factors, demographic, socioeconomic and racial characteristics play an important role. Methods. We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results. Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data. For every one unit increase in a scaled standardized measure of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in a community, there was an approximate 8-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test in a ZCTA (Incidence Density Ratio = 8.2, 95% Credible Interval 3.7, 18.3). There was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7) associated with the proportion of Black \/ African American residents. Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black\/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black\/African American residents and proportion of older persons. Conclusions.

Being one of the most affected countries in Europe, in March 2020, Germany established several nonpharmaceutical interventions to contain the virus spread, including the closure of schools and child day care facilities (March 16-18, 2020) as well as a full \"lockdown\" with forced social distancing and closures of \"nonessential\" services (March 23, 2020). The present study attempts to analyze whether these governmental interventions had an impact on the declared aim of \"flattening the curve\", referring to the epidemic curve of new infections. This analysis is conducted from a regional perspective. On the level of the 412 German counties, logistic growth models were estimated based on daily infections (estimated from reported cases), aiming at determining the regional growth rate of infections and the point of inflection where infection rates begin to decrease and the curve flattens. All German counties exceeded the peak of new infections between the beginning of March and the middle of April. In a large majority of German counties, the epidemic curve has flattened before the \"lockdown\" was established. In a minority of counties, the peak was already exceeded before school closures. The growth rates of infections vary spatially depending on the time the virus emerged. Counties belonging to states which established an additional curfew show no significant improvement with respect to growth rates and mortality. Furthermore, mortality varies strongly across German counties, which can be attributed to infections of people belonging to the \"risk group\", especially residents of retirement homes. The results raise the question whether social ban measures and curfews really contribute to curve flattening within a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Wieland","author_inst":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael Klein","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cherisse Berry","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Spiros Frangos","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dr Muhammad Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101675","rel_title":"Reproducing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics byregion-specific variables and modeling contacttracing App containment","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101675","rel_abs":"Targeted contact-tracing through mobile phone apps has been proposed as an instrument to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and manage the lifting of nation-wide lockdowns currently in place in USA and Europe. However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in the light of region-specific demographics. We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can successfully mitigate the epidemic even with a relatively small fraction of users, and even suppress it altogether with a larger fraction of users. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draw attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Ferrari","author_inst":"FROM research foundation"},{"author_name":"Enrico Santus","author_inst":"Bayer, Decision Science & Advanced Analytics for MA, PV & RA Division."},{"author_name":"Davide Cirillo","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), C\/ Jordi Girona 29, 08034, Barcelona,Spain."},{"author_name":"Miguel Ponce-de-Leon","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), C\/ Jordi Girona 29, 08034, Barcelona,Spain."},{"author_name":"Nicola Marino","author_inst":"Women's Brain Project (WBP), Gunterhausen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Ferretti","author_inst":"Women's Brain Project (WBP), Gunterhausen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santuccione Chadha","author_inst":"Women's Brain Project (WBP), Gunterhausen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Mavridis","author_inst":"Interactive Robots and Media Laboratory (IRLM), United Arab Emirates."},{"author_name":"Alfonso Valencia","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), C\/ Jordi Girona 29, 08034, Barcelona,Spain."},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101642","rel_title":"Knowledge of novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) among a Georgian population","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101642","rel_abs":"Introduction Georgia confirmed its first case of SARS-COV-2 infection on February 26, 2020 and by March 31, a total of 110 cases have been reported. Limited understanding about epidemics can lead to panic and disrupt public health efforts to contain transmission. It is important to understand perceptions of the population regarding the disease. This study reports results of a survey designed to understand attitudes and knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 virus among Georgian population, including health care workers (HCWs). Materials and methods The online survey was conducted using a Facebook advertisement. The target was the whole country and the language used was Georgian. We collected information on demographic data, knowledge of the disease, including perceived differences between coronavirus and influenza. We also included questions to capture the populations perceptions about government preparedness to combat the new coronavirus. Results The survey was open for three days (March 2-4, 2020). 5228 participants completed the survey. Of these, 40.3% were 25-45 years old, 58.2% were female, 20.7% had university degree and 10.3% were HCWs. For 25.8% of respondents, COVID-19 and influenza are the same diseases; 10.9% did not know if they are different. The majority correctly identified the transmission route and symptoms (96.9% and 98.0%, respectively). 19.1% think that Georgia is ready for COVID 19 epidemic, while according to 55% the county is not ready, but HCWs are trying hard to respond properly. For 18% response is inadequate. There was no difference in knowledge between HCWs, non-HCWs and unemployed. 20% of HCWs as well as other study subjects believe that SARS-COV-2 vaccine and medications do exist but are simply not available in Georgia.

All patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital of Madrid, with medical diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease, and with symptomatic COVID-19 disease were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID-19. Covariates: sociodemographic, clinical and treatments. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to assess risk factors of hospital admission. RESULTS: 123 patients with IRD and COVID-19 disease were identified and included.

Male sex, associated comorbidities and glucocorticoids use showed a tendency risk (p<0.2) CONCLUSION: Our results suggests that age, comorbidities and having an autoimmune systemic condition increased the risk of hospital admission, whereas disease modifying agents were not associated with hospital admission.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dalifer Freites","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Leticia Leon","author_inst":"IdISSC Hospital Clinico San Carlos"},{"author_name":"Arkaitz Mucientes","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Rodriguez-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISCC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Judit Font","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Madrid","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Ignacio Colomer","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Angel Jover","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20101329","rel_title":"Empiric model for short-time prediction of COVID-19spreading","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20101329","rel_abs":"Covid-19 appearance and fast spreading took by surprise the international community. Collaboration between researchers, public health workers and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate that is able to show the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity. Moreover, it allows to carry out short-term predictions and long-term estimations that may facilitate policy decisions and the revision of in-place confinement measures and the development of new protocols. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several Chinese provinces and from other countries with a successful containment of the disease. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity between countries. In countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, model predictions provide a reliable picture of its short-term evolution and may permit to unveil some characteristics of the long-term evolution. These predictions can also be generalized to short-term hospital and Intensive Care Units (ICU) requirements, which together with the equivalent predictions on mortality provide key information for health officials.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marti Catala","author_inst":"Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alonso","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Enrique Alvarez Lacalle","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lopez","author_inst":"Universitat  Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pere-Joan Cardona","author_inst":"Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia"},{"author_name":"Clara Prats","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Jose Ignacio Colomer","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Angel Jover","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20101261","rel_title":"Is there a link between temperatures and COVID-19 contagions?

To that end, Bayesian Model Averaging techniques are used to analyze the relevance of the temperatures together with a set of additional climate, environmental, demographic, social and policy factors. The robustness of individual covariates is measured through posterior inclusion probabilities. The empirical analysis provides conclusive evidence on the role played by the temperatures given that it appears as the most relevant determinant of contagions. This finding is robust to (i) the prior distribution elicitation, (ii) the procedure to assign weights to the regressors, (iii) the presence of measurement errors in official data due to under-reporting, (iv) the employment of different metrics of temperatures or (v) the inclusion of additional correlates. In a second step, relative importance metrics that perform an accurate partitioning of the R2 of the model are calculated. The results of this approach support the evidence of the model averaging analysis, given that temperature is the top driver explaining 45% of regional contagion disparities. The set of policy-related factors appear in a second level of importance, whereas factors related to the degree of social connectedness or the demographic characteristics are less relevant.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vicente Rios","author_inst":"No affiliation"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gianmoena","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Enrique Alvarez Lacalle","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lopez","author_inst":"Universitat  Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pere-Joan Cardona","author_inst":"Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia"},{"author_name":"Clara Prats","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Jose Ignacio Colomer","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Angel Jover","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101162","rel_title":"Estimation of COVID-19 transmission rates in California and the U.S. with reporting delays","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101162","rel_abs":"We estimated time-varying reproduction numbers of COVID-19 transmission in counties and regions of California and in states of the United States, using the Wallinga-Teunis method of estimations applied to publicly available data.

But it is vital to understand what is causing this: worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. Objective: To explore the time-varying longitudinal relationship between (i) worries about adversity, and (ii) experience of adversity, and both anxiety and depression and test the moderating role of socio-economic position. Design: Longitudinal cohort study Setting: Community study Participants: A well-stratified sample of UK adults recruited into the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the Covid-19 pandemic) via a combination of convenience and targeted recruitment. The sample was weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Exposures: Worries or experiences of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic Outcomes: Anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) Results: Data were analysed from 41,909 UK adults (weighted data: 51% female, aged 18-99) followed up across 6 weeks (178,430 observations). Using fixed effects regression was used to explore within-person variation over time, cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. Individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by adverse experiences. Conclusions & relevance: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given we are still seeing clear associations with poor mental health both for cumulative worries and also for a range of specific worries relating to finance, access to essentials, personal safety and COVID-19. Interventions are required that both seek to prevent adverse events (e.g. redundancies) and that reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liam Wright","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer C.

A lack of awareness and poor understanding of the disease may result in rapid transmission of the disease in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the awareness, perception, and attitude towards COVID-19 among Bangladeshi medical doctors. Method: This cross sectional, web-based study was conducted with the help of an online questionnaire and sent to the doctors which comprised of a series of questions regarding demographics of the participants, symptoms and incubation period of COVID-19, mode of transmission, measures to prevent transmission, availability of training and personal protective equipment in Bangladeshi hospitals, and attitude of doctors towards the treatment of suspected patients with COVID-19. Results: Of 800 medical doctors, a total 545 completed the survey (response 68.13%). Among the participants, 52.3% were females, 72.8% were below 30 years of age, and majority (52.8%) were working outside the cities in the villages and rural areas. A total of 404 (74.1%) doctors reported the correct incubation period of COVID-19. Majority doctors were aware of the symptoms with mode of transmission of COVID-19, measures to prevent hospital transmission, along with ways of identifying suspected patients with COVID-19. However, more than 90% of the doctors reported of inadequate intensive care unit and ventilator facilities along with extreme scarcity of personal protective equipment in the hospitals. 65.7% doctors prefer avoid working with a COVID-19 patient and more than 50% doctors have expressed that they would send the suspected COVID-19 patients to designated hospitals without providing treatment. Conclusion: The health authorities should take appropriate training measures to increase the awareness of the medical doctors along with providing sufficient amount of personal protective equipment for the medical doctors and supporting staff before deploying them in hospitals.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadia Biswas Mumu","author_inst":"North South University"},{"author_name":"Most Nasrin Aktar","author_inst":"Brac University"},{"author_name":"Zabun Nahar","author_inst":"University of Asia Pacific"},{"author_name":"Shahana Sharmin","author_inst":"Brac University"},{"author_name":"Md Shaki Mostaid","author_inst":"Brac University"},{"author_name":"Eugene T.

More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them one of the critical approach which is treated as radiology imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this article, we have introduced a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%.

We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation. Methods. We developed informatic tools (Covid Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time growth rate, geographical distribution and characteristics of Covid-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints and study designs. Data and analyses are publicly available at https:\/\/bioinfo.ieo.it\/shiny\/app\/CovidCT Results. We observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment. Conclusions. This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth sheds doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable result.

In spite of several observational studies and a few randomized controlled trials, the effect of hydroxychloroquine on patients with COVID 19 infection remains unclear. We undertook this systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine among patients with COVID 19 infection. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and other relevant resources until August 1, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which hydroxychloroquine was administered and compared to a control group. Data were extracted, and quality assessment of the studies was carried out. We evaluated symptomatic progression, mortality, viral clearance, evolution of changes on chest CT imaging, and adverse events. A fixed or random-effects model was used depending on outcome heterogeneity. Results We included 23 studies, including seven randomized controlled trials and 16 observational studies. Among these, 11,029 patients received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination, while 12063 did not. Mortality was reported at different points in time. The overall mortality was not significantly different among patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.22; p = 0.63). Clinical worsening did not differ between patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to those who did not (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.52; p = 0.77). Negative conversion, assessed by RT PCR, did not differ significantly between the hydroxychloroquine and the control groups (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.21 to 2.11; p = 0.49). The evolution of changes on chest CT imaging was reported only in two studies; a more pronounced improvement was observed with the use of hydroxychloroquine compared to standard care (OR: 2.68, CI: 1.1 to 6.55; P = 0.03). The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher with hydroxychloroquine (OR: 5.95, CI: 2.56 to 13.83; p < 0.00001). Conclusions Our meta analysis does not suggest improvement in mortality, clinical progression, or negative conversion by RT PCR among patients with COVID-19 infection who are treated with hydroxychloroquine. There was a significantly higher incidence of adverse events with hydroxychloroquine use.

Design: Case-control, observational study that includes an observation period from arrival to discharge or inpatient death. Both Cox proportional hazards and average treatment effects models were used to determine survival and treatment benefits. Setting: Three Cone Health acute care hospitals including one COVID dedicated facility. Patients: Patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from March 16, 2020 through April 22, 2020. Exposure: Tocilizumab dosed at either 400 mg fixed dose or 8 mg\/kg weight-based dose with maximum single dose of 800mg. Measurements and Main Results: Overall, 86 patients were admitted during the observation period with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Of these, 21 received Tocilizumab during the hospital stay. Both the Cox model and treatment effects models showed short-term survival benefit. There was an associated 75% reduction in the risk of inpatient death when treated (HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.07-0.90) in the Cox model. This association was confirmed in the treatment effects model where we found a 52.7% reduced risk of dying while hospitalized compared to those not treated (RR 0.472; 95% CI 0.449-0.497). In both models, we show short-term survival benefit in patients with severe COVID-19 illness.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Murali Ramaswamy","author_inst":"PulmonIx, LLC and Cone Health Division of Critical Care & Pulmonary Medicine"},{"author_name":"Praveen Mannam","author_inst":"Cone Health Division of Critical Care & Pulmonary Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Comer","author_inst":"Cone Health Division of Infectious Diseases Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Sinclair","author_inst":"Cone Health Antimicrobial Stewardship Program"},{"author_name":"Douglas Brent McQuaid","author_inst":"Cone Health Division of Critical Care & Pulmonary Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica L Schmidt","author_inst":"Cone Health Enterprise Analytics"},{"author_name":"Piergiuseppe Pelicci","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Luca Mazzarella","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20101113","rel_title":"Temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state and city","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20101113","rel_abs":"From the first cases detected in Wuhan, China, of infections by the disease of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, until the present moment of this pandemic, millions of people have already been infected and hundreds of thousands have died worldwide. The way in which the virus has been dispersed in Brazil, and more specifically in Rio de Janeiro, is the motivation of the present work. Our studies consist of analyzing temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in the municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro and in the neighborhoods of the state capital, based on open data published by the Health Departments of Governments of the State of RJ and the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, covering the period from February 27, 2020 to April 27, 2020. For that, we use analysis of time evolution graphs and mappings of spatial distributions and statistics analysis of spatial correlation. Our results suggest that the initial stages of spreading the virus across the state occur exponentially, with specific regions with a higher concentration of rates of cases, deaths and recovered people. In addition, our qualitative and quantitative results, for the data considered, point out that the regions with the highest income average per capita have higher rates of confirmed cases and recovered people, however, the regions of higher lethality do not are found in these places, with several of these regions of high lethality in places of low income per capita. Our results reinforce the idea of creating specific and strategic plans for policies to combat the spread of COVID-19 in the various localities in Rio de Janeiro.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Douglas Ferreira","author_inst":"LISComp Laboratory, Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Paula Ferreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Paulo Oliveira Jr.","author_inst":"LISComp Laboratory, Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Ribeiro","author_inst":"LISComp Laboratory, Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Elicardo Goncalves","author_inst":"LISComp Laboratory, Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Andres Papa","author_inst":"Geophysics Department, National Observatory"},{"author_name":"Piergiuseppe Pelicci","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Luca Mazzarella","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.097295","rel_title":"High speed large scale automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples using miniaturized co-culture coupled with high content screening","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.097295","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus infecting humans, is responsible for the current COVID-19 global pandemic. If several strains could be isolated worldwide, especially for in-vitro drug susceptibility testing and vaccine development, few laboratories routinely isolate SARS-CoV-2. This is due to the fact that the current co-culture strategy is highly time consuming and requires working in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. In this work, we present a new strategy based on high content screening automated microscopy (HCS) allowing large scale isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples in 1 week. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 tested negative, were processed with our HCS procedure and were compared to the classical isolation procedure. Isolation rate was 43 % with both strategies on RT-PCR positive samples, and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, where we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with HCS strategy, where 80 % of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, as compared to only 25 % with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive elements after 1 week of co-culture. This system allows rapid and automated screening of clinical samples with minimal operator work load, thus reducing the risks of contamination.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rania Francis","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Marion Le Bideau","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Jardot","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Clio Grimaldier","author_inst":"AP-HM"},{"author_name":"Didier Raoult","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Yaacoub Bou Khalil","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Bernard La Scola","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Luca Mazzarella","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099572","rel_title":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Is Chronic Inflammation a Major Cause of Death?","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20099572","rel_abs":"Abstract Background. Today humanity is facing another infectious threat: a newly emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. It was already described that COVID-19 mortality among elderly people and people with such underlying conditions as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes s increased. Dysregulation of the immune responses vital for antiviral defense, which are typical for chronic inflammation, led us to a hypothesis that chronic inflammation is the main risk factor for increased susceptibility and mortality from COVID-19. Method. Based on the available information for 126 countries, statistical analysis to find out whether the difference in incidence and mortality within countries can be explained by the existing chronic inflammation among the countries population, was conducted. Results. A positive correlation between the percentage of people dying from chronic noncommunicable diseases and COVID-19 incidence (p<0.001) and mortality (p<0.001) within countries. Conclusion. The problem of COVID-19-caused high mortality rate may be a consequence of the high number of people having chronic low-grade inflammation as a precondition, and thus, one of the potential ways to reduce risk of morbidity and mortality is to focus on this widespread health problem, mainly occurring in developed countries and to take corresponding diagnostic, preventative, and treatment measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albina Tskhay","author_inst":"Locus Fermentation Solutions, LLC"},{"author_name":"Alena Yezhova","author_inst":"Locus Fermentation Solutions, LLC"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Alibek","author_inst":"Locus Fermentation Solutions, LLC"},{"author_name":"Clio Grimaldier","author_inst":"AP-HM"},{"author_name":"Didier Raoult","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Yaacoub Bou Khalil","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Bernard La Scola","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Luca Mazzarella","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
