We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a simple model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant variable which is specific to each area. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the `current' level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. Finally, we see that small deviations from the optimal solution can lead to dramatic violations of the constraints.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Afroza Shirin","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"},{"author_name":"Yen Ting Lin","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Francesco Sorrentino","author_inst":"University of New Mexico"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20183350","rel_title":"A Rational-Choice Model of Covid-19 Transmission with Endogenous Quarantining and Two-sided Prevention","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20183350","rel_abs":"This paper offers a parsimonious, rational-choice model to study the effect of pre-existing inequalities on the transmission of COVID-19. Agents decide whether to \"go out\" (or self-quarantine) and, if so, whether to wear protection such as masks. Three elements distinguish the model from existing work. First, non-symptomatic agents do not know if they are infected. Second, some of these agents unknowingly transmit infections. Third, we permit two-sided prevention via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions: the probability of a person catching the virus from another depends on protection choices made by each. We find that a mean-preserving increase in pre-existing income inequality unambiguously increases the equilibrium proportion of unprotected, socializing agents and may increase or decrease the proportion who self-quarantine. Strikingly, while higher pre-COVID inequality may or may not raise the overall risk of infection, it increases the risk of disease in social interactions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joydeep Bhattacharya","author_inst":"iowa state university"},{"author_name":"Shankha Chakraborty","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Xiumei Yu","author_inst":"Zhongnan University of Economics and Law"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.20182477","rel_title":"Modelling COVID-19 contagion:Risk assessment and  targeted mitigation policies","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.20182477","rel_abs":"We use a spatial epidemic model with demographic and geographic heterogeneity to study the regional dynamics of COVID-19 across 133 regions in England.

We define a concept of efficiency for comparative analysis of epidemic control policies and show targeted mitigation policies based on local monitoring to be more efficient than country-level or non-targeted measures.

Well-established measures, such as social distancing, testing, contact tracing, improved hygiene, and generalized use of personal protective equipment, are almost impossible to implement. We specifically investigated the impact of adapting these measures to informal settlements located in regions immersed in protracted conflicts, taking the Northwest region of Syria (NWS) as a case study. Such regions need to contend with the public health challenges resulting from violence, deterioration of health-systems, and political instability. We implemented a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model to simulate the spread of the virus in high-density camps of Internally Displaced Persons, using a population structure representative of these camps. We chose parameters corresponding to a worst-case scenario where there is no healthcare available. We expanded on previous models to adapt feasible interventions to the living conditions in the camps, including moderate self-distancing, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, and protection of the most vulnerable in \"safety zones\". All the interventions significantly reduce the probability of observing an outbreak and the death toll. Self-distancing brings the best results if contacts are reduced by 50%, with mortality reduced by up to 35%. A similar reduction in mortality can be achieved by providing 1 self-isolation tent per 200 individuals. Protecting the vulnerable in a safety zone has synergistic effects with previous interventions for the whole population, but is especially beneficial for the vulnerable population. Complementary measures, such as lockdown of the safety zone when a first case is detected in the camp, further reduce mortality and the probability of an outbreak. Our model predicts that a combination of all simulated interventions may reduce mortality by as much as 80%. The time until the number of symptomatic cases peaks is delayed by most of the interventions, in some cases by more than three months. The proportion of the population that recovers, near 70%, could help prevent future outbreaks. Our results highlight the potential of non-medical interventions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. They demonstrate that interventions shown to be effective in other settings can be adapted to refugee camps and are most effective when implemented in tandem. Our modelization considers complementary measures to these interventions that can be implemented autonomously by these communities, such as buffer zones, daily health-checks, and carers for isolated individuals, quantifying their impact on the micro-dynamics of disease transmission. Similar measures may be applicable to controlling COVID-19 in other informal settlements, particularly Internally Displaced Persons camps in conflict regions, around the world.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Pascual-Garc\u00eda","author_inst":"ETH-Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jordan Klein","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Villers","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Eduard Campillo-Funollet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Chamsy Sarkis","author_inst":"Pax Syriana Foundation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20183129","rel_title":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wellbeing and cognitive functioning of older adults","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20183129","rel_abs":"COVID-19 took a heavy toll on older adults.

In response to its world-wide outbreak radical measures were taken by governments across the world including curfew, quarantine, travel bans, social distancing, work place and school closures, etc, to reduce the transmission of the virus. These measures led to dramatic social and economic changes for the general population, in addition to the fears and worries related to the disease and its contraction. First studies report the impact of the pandemic on mental well-being of the general population showing increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In this study, we compare the impact of the pandemic on two European countries: the UK and Germany, which reported their first cases within a week. 241 residents of the UK and 541 residents of Germany filled in an online survey, including questions on COVID-19 exposure, impact on financial situation and work, substance and media consumption, self-reported mental and physical health, as well as including two clinical questionnaires, the general mental health Symptom Check List-27 (SCL-27) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. Data collection was completed between 27\/04\/20-31\/05\/20. We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on their health, financial situation and their families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, with a higher percentage being above cut-off. Interestingly, however, we found that German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. Generally, we found that a younger age, being female, lower education, poorer mental and physical health before the pandemic, as well as more social media and substance consumption was associated with a higher clinical risk. As 25% of all responders report a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20-50% of responders reaching the clinical cut-off for depressive, dysthymic and anxieties, future pandemics require a tailored intervention system to assist not only people vulnerable for mental health problems, but also large proportions of the general public.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Franziska Knolle","author_inst":"Technical University Munich"},{"author_name":"Lisa Ronan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Graham K Murray","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Marie-Anne Vanderhasselt","author_inst":"UGent"},{"author_name":"Rudi De Raedt","author_inst":"UGent"},{"author_name":"Eva Van den Bussche","author_inst":"KU Leuven"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.28.20183814","rel_title":"Host-to-Host Airborne Transmission As a Multiphase Flow Problem For Science-Based Social Distance Guidelines","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.28.20183814","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic has strikingly demonstrated how important it is to develop fundamental knowledge related to generation, transport and inhalation of pathogen-laden droplets and their subsequent possible fate as airborne particles, or aerosols, in the context of human to human transmission. It is also increasingly clear that airborne transmission is an important contributor to rapid spreading of the disease. In this paper, we discuss the processes of droplet generation by exhalation, their potential transformation into airborne particles by evaporation, transport over long distances by the exhaled puff and by ambient air turbulence, and final inhalation by the receiving host as interconnected multiphase flow processes. A simple model for the time evolution of droplet\/aerosol concentration is presented based on a theoretical analysis of the relevant physical processes. The modeling framework along with detailed experiments and simulations can be used to study a wide variety of scenarios involving breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing and in a number of environmental conditions, as humid or dry atmosphere, confined or open environment. Although a number of questions remain open on the physics of evaporation and coupling with persistence of the virus, it is clear that with a more reliable understanding of the underlying flow physics of virus transmission one can set the foundation for an improved methodology in designing case-specific social distancing and infection control guidelines.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S Balachandar","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Stephane Zaleski","author_inst":"Sorbonne"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Soldati","author_inst":"TU Wien"},{"author_name":"Goodarz Ahmadi","author_inst":"Clarkson University"},{"author_name":"Lydia Bourouiba","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Eva Van den Bussche","author_inst":"KU Leuven"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20183202","rel_title":"Data-Driven Inference of COVID-19 Clinical Prognosis","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20183202","rel_abs":"Knowing the most likely clinical prognosis for a patient infected with SARS-Cov-2 could offer guidelines for tracking their medical evolution, improving attention, and assigning resources.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic context. Methods We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. Results The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], mild Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]).

There is limited information about the clinical characteristics and events leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). We described the factors associated with the development of AKI and explored the relation of AKI and mortality in Mexican population with severe COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized at the largest third-level reference institution for COVID-19 care in Mexico between March and April 2020. Demographic information, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory data, dates of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, mechanical-ventilator settings and use of vasoactive drugs were recorded. Results: Of 99 patients studied, 58 developed AKI (58.6%). The group with AKI had higher body mass index (p=0.0003) and frequency of obesity (p=0.001); a higher requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.008) and vasoactive drugs (p=0.004); greater levels of serum creatinine (p<0.001) and D-dimer on admission (p<0.001); and lower lymphocyte counts (p=0.001) than the non-AKI group. The multivariate analysis indicated that risk factors for AKI were obesity (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.33-5.51, p=0.005); higher serum creatinine (HR=1.44, CI=1.02-2.02, p=0.035) and D-dimer levels on admission (HR=1.14, CI=1.06-1.23, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group (65.5% vs. 14.6%; p=0.001).

Results - Fifty-five patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included, 43 of whom showed encephalopathy, and were further divided into mild, moderate and severe encephalopathy groups. Nineteen patients (44%) had undergone mechanical ventilation and received intravenous sedatives. Eleven (26%) patients were on dialysis. Laboratory markers of COVID-19 severity were very common in encephalopathy patients, but did not correlate with the severity of encephalopathy. Thirty-nine patients underwent neuroimaging studies, which showed mostly non-specific changes. One patient showed lesions possibly related to CNS demyelination. Four had suffered an acute stroke. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR in only one of 21 CSF samples. Two CSF samples showed elevated white blood cell count and all were negative for oligoclonal bands.

Conclusion - In our consecutive series with 43 encephalopathy cases, neuroimaging and CSF analysis did not support the role of direct viral CNS invasion or CNS inflammation as the cause of encephalopathy.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raphael Tuma","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Bruno Guedes","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Rafael Carra","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Bruno Iepsen","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Julia Rodrigues","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Antonio Edvan Camelo Filho","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Kubota","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Maira Ferrari","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Adalberto Studart-Neto","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Mariana Oku","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Sara Terrim","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopes","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Carlos Eduardo Passos Neto","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Matheus Dalben","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Julia De Souza","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Jose Pedro Baima","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Tomas Da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Iago Perissinotti","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Maria da Graca Martin","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurradiologia"},{"author_name":"Marcia Goncalves","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Ida Fortini","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Jerusa Smid","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Tarso Adoni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Leandro Lucatto","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurradiologia"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Nitrini","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Helio Gomes","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Luiz Henrique Castro","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.20183277","rel_title":"DeepSOCIAL: Social Distancing Monitoring and Infection Risk Assessment in COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.20183277","rel_abs":"Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in public places.

The proposed model includes a YOLOv4-based framework and inverse perspective mapping for accurate people detection and social distancing monitoring in challenging conditions, including people occlusion, partial visibility, and lighting variations. We also provide an online risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the Spatio-temporal data from the moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. We identify high-risk zones with the highest possibility of virus spread and infections. This may help authorities to redesign the layout of a public place or to take precaution actions to mitigate high-risk zones. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is evaluated on the Oxford Town Centre dataset, with superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed compared to three state-of-the-art methods.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahdi Rezaei","author_inst":"The University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Azarmi","author_inst":"Qazvin Azad University"},{"author_name":"Rafael Carra","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Bruno Iepsen","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Julia Rodrigues","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Antonio Edvan Camelo Filho","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Kubota","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Maira Ferrari","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Adalberto Studart-Neto","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Mariana Oku","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Sara Terrim","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopes","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Carlos Eduardo Passos Neto","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Matheus Dalben","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Julia De Souza","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Jose Pedro Baima","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Tomas Da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Iago Perissinotti","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Maria da Graca Martin","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurradiologia"},{"author_name":"Marcia Goncalves","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Ida Fortini","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Jerusa Smid","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Tarso Adoni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Leandro Lucatto","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurradiologia"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Nitrini","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Helio Gomes","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"},{"author_name":"Luiz Henrique Castro","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina, Hospital das Clinicas, Departamento de Neurologia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.28.20183863","rel_title":"Unmasking the conversation on masks: Natural language processing for topical sentiment analysis of COVID-19 Twitter discourse","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.28.20183863","rel_abs":"In this exploratory study, we scrutinize a database of over 1 million tweets collected across the first five months of 2020 to draw conclusions about public attitudes towards the preventative measure of mask usage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We employ natural language processing, clustering and sentiment analysis techniques to organize tweets relating to mask-wearing into high-level themes, then relay narratives for individual clusters through automatic text summarization. We find that topic clustering and visualization based on mask-related Twitter data offers revealing insights into societal perceptions of COVID-19 and techniques for its prevention.

To augment traditional lab and hospital-based surveillance, Bangladesh established a participatory surveillance system for the public to self-report symptoms consistent with COVID-19 through multiple channels. Here, we report on the use of this system, which received over 3 million responses within two months, for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. Although we observe considerable noise in the data and initial volatility in the use of the different reporting mechanisms, the self-reported syndromic data exhibits a strong association with lab-confirmed cases at a local scale. Moreover, the syndromic data also suggests an earlier spread of the outbreak across Bangladesh than is evident from the confirmed case counts, consistent with predicted spread of the outbreak based on population mobility data. Our results highlight the usefulness of participatory syndromic surveillance for mapping disease burden generally, and particularly during the initial phases of an emerging outbreak.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayesha S Mahmud","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Shayan Chowdhury","author_inst":"a2i Programme"},{"author_name":"Kawsar Hossain Sojib","author_inst":"a2i Programme"},{"author_name":"Anir Chowdhury","author_inst":"a2i Programme"},{"author_name":"Md.

Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) is considered the optimal sample for SARS-CoV2 diagnosis and sputum (SPT) has been proposed as an economic alternative. However, the temporal concordance of diagnosis in NPS and SPT has not been addressed. Methods: Through a longitudinal study we compared the shedding dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA evaluated by RT-qPCR in serially collected SPT and NPS obtained from 82 ambulatory and hospitalized patients during acute infection and convalescence. The concordance during the follow-up and cost analysis between both collected specimens was evaluated. Findings: We analyzed 379 samples, 177 NPS and 202 SPT. The highest proportion of positive samples was detected within the first 15 days after the symptoms onset. The median time of positivity was higher for NPS (median= 25 days) than SPT (median= 21 days). There was no significant difference in the median RT-qPCR CT values between both sample types. The temporal categorization of matched-paired samples indicated substantial correlation (r=0.6023) and substantial agreement (87.23%) during the first ten days since symptoms onset (kappa = 0.697). A cost analysis demonstrated a significant saving when the SPT specimen was used. Interpretation: Sputum is a feasible and cost-saving alternative to NPS, providing an equivalent value for the detection and follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge E Levican-Asenjo","author_inst":"1Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Leonardo I Almonacid","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Valenzuela","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Tamara Garcia","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Luis Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

RESULTS We analyzed 97,476 individuals. Median age was 41y (range <1-105y), and 57.2% (95% CI 57.2, 57.2) were female. In total, 958 (0.98%; 95% CI 0.92,1.05) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positivity rates were lower in regional areas than cities, in females (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70, 0.91), and in those aged 16y and below (p<0.01, test for trend). Of the 958 positive individuals, 243 had two or more (max 17) additional tests, and 92% (95% CI 88.1, 95.2) remained positive after 10 days (max 76 days) after the initial result. Median time to apparent viral clearance was longer in those 65y and over compared to those under 65y (29 v 43 days, HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.17, 2.90), and was unaffected by sex (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.66, 1.30). CONCLUSIONS Females and those 16y and under were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Detectable RNA may persist for long periods, negating the value of repeat testing for declaring individuals free of infection. Viral clearance rates appear lower in those over 65y of age compared with younger individuals.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paulina Stehlik","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Practice Professorial Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital and Health Service, Southport, Queensland, Australia; Institute for Evidence-Based Pra"},{"author_name":"Kylie Alcorn","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, Gold Coast University Hospital and Health Service, Southport, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Anna Jones","author_inst":"Pathology Queensland (Gold Coast Microbiology Laboratory), Health Support Queensland, Queensland Health, Southport, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sanmarie Schlebusch","author_inst":"Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Andre Wattiaux","author_inst":"Gold Coast Public Health Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital and Health Service, Carrara, Queensland, Australia."},{"author_name":"David Henry","author_inst":"Evidence-Based Practice Professorial Unit, Gold Coast University Hospital and Health Service, Southport, Queensland, Australia; Institute for Evidence-Based Pra"},{"author_name":"Catalina Pardo-Roa","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Erick Salinas","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile"},{"author_name":"Maria J Avendano","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Fabiola Perazzo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Luis A Diaz","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Valderrama","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."},{"author_name":"Marcos Ortega","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

More broadly, sex differences in infectious and inflammatory processes are well known, with women tending to mount stronger immune responses than men. Although there is evidence that sex hormone signaling is immunomodulatory, including downregulation of immune\/inflammatory responses by androgens, the existence of numerous other physiologic differences between the sexes leads to great uncertainty in attributing worse infectious disease outcomes in men to androgen signaling. No definitive genetic data exist to support androgen-mediated immune suppression for viral susceptibility, nor for adrenal androgens. Here we show an association between inheritance of the common adrenal-permissive missense-encoding variant HSD3B1(1245C), that enables androgen synthesis from adrenal precursors10, and susceptibility to COVID. The adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) has previously been linked to suppression of inflammation in severe asthma. In analysis of COVID test results from the UK Biobank, we show that in older ([&ge;] 70 years of age) subjects, the adrenal-permissive variant is associated with a greater chance of being COVID-positive. The effect increases with the number of HSD3B1(1245C) alleles inherited and is greater in females such that increasing androgen synthesis confers risk approaching males. Our study suggests that a common androgen synthesis variant regulates immune susceptibility to COVID infection as well as potentially other immune and inflammatory processes.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey M.

However, last updated recommendations have not taken a position either for or against the use of other immunomodulators such as tocilizumab (TCZ), with or without CS, since results are still limited. Methods: From March 17 to April 7, 2020, a real-world observational retrospective analysis was conducted at our 750-bed university hospital to study the characteristics and risk factors for mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ, with or without CS, in addition to standard of care (SOC). Data were obtained from routine clinical practice, stored in electronic medical records. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 1,092 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period. Of them, 186 (17%) were treated with TCZ, of which 129 (87.8%) in combination with CS. Of the total 186, 155 (83.3 %) patients were receiving non-invasive ventilation when TCZ, with or without CS was initiated. Mean time from symptoms onset and hospital admission to TCZ use was 12 (SD 4.3) and 4.3 days (SD 3.4), respectively. Overall, 147 (79%) survived and 39 (21%) died. By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (HR=1.09, p<0.001), chronic heart failure (HR=4.4, p=0.003), and chronic liver disease (HR=4.69, p=0.004). The use of CS, in combination with TCZ, was the main protective factor against mortality (HR=0.26, p<0.001) in such severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ. No serious superinfections were observed after a 30-day follow-up. Conclusions: In severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ due to systemic host-immune inflammatory response syndrome, the use of CS in combined therapy with TCZ, was the main protective factor against in-hospital mortality.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Bellvitge University Hospital, Bellvitge Biomedical

major challenge in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is the high false-negative rate of the commonly used standard RT-PCR methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples. Accurate detection is particularly challenging in samples with low viral loads that are below the limit of detection (LoD) of standard one- or two-step RT-PCR methods. Methods: We implement a three-step approach for SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification that employs reverse transcription, targeted cDNA preamplification and nano-scale qPCR based on the Fluidigm 192.24 microfluidic chip. We validate the method using both positive controls and nasopharyngeal swab samples. Results: Using SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA and plasmid controls, we demonstrate that the addition of a preamplification step enhances the LoD of the Fluidigm method by 1,000-fold, enabling detection below 1 copy\/l. We applied this method to analyze 182 clinical NP swab samples previously diagnosed using a standard RT-qPCR protocol (91 positive, 91 negative) and demonstrate reproducible detection of SARS-CoV-2 over five orders of magnitude (< 1 to 106 viral copies\/l). Crucially, we detect SARS-CoV-2 with relatively low viral load estimates (<1 to 40 viral copies\/l) in 17 samples with negative clinical diagnosis, indicating a potential false negative rate of 18.7% by clinical diagnostic procedures. Conclusion: The three-step nano-scale RT-qPCR method can robustly detect SARS-CoV-2 in samples with relatively low viral loads (< 1 viral copy\/l) and has the potential to reduce the false negative rate of standard RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Xie","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Tamara Gjorgjieva","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Zaynoun Attieh","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mame Massar Dieng","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Marc Arnoux","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mostafa Khair","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Yasmine Moussa","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Fatima Al Jallaf","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Nabil Rahiman","author_inst":"New York University Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Christopher A.

All subjects showed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses to at least one antigen. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were primarily of the central memory phenotype and exhibited a lower IFN-[gamma] to TNF-[alpha] ratio compared to influenza-specific responses of the same donors, independent of disease severity. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were less multifunctional than influenza-specific T cells, particularly in severe cases, potentially suggesting exhaustion. High IL-10 production was noted in response to N protein, possibly contributing to immunosuppression, with potential implications for vaccine design. We observed granzyme B+\/IFN-[gamma] CD4+ and CD8+ proliferative responses to peptide pools in most individuals, with CD4+ responses predominating over CD8+ responses. Peripheral T follicular helper responses to S or N strongly correlated with serum neutralization assays as well as RBD-specific IgA. Overall, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are robust, however, CD4+ Th1 responses predominate over CD8+ responses and are more inflammatory with a weaker Tfh response than influenza-specific CD4+ responses, potentially contributing to COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaclyn C Law","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Wan Koh","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Jonah Lin","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"FengYun Yue","author_inst":"Universitiy of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kento T Abe","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mt.

clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma with sufficient IgG titer (1:320) obtained from recovered donors was administered to adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Primary outcomes were adverse events in association with plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included disease progression, recovery, length of stay, and hospital discharge. Of the 38 patients included in the analysis, 24 (63%) recovered and were discharged, and 14 (37%) died. Patients who received convalescent plasma early in the disease course (severe illness group) as compared to the patients that received convalescent plasma later in disease progression (critical illness group) had significantly lower hospital mortality 13% vs 55% (p<0.02) and shorter mean hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days (p<0.01). One patient experienced a transient transfusion reaction. No other adverse effects of convalescent plasma infusion were observed. Our results suggest that convalescent plasma is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical outcomes including recovery and survival if given to patients early in the course of COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danyal Ibrahim","author_inst":"Trinity Health Of New England"},{"author_name":"Latha Dulipsingh","author_inst":"Saint Francis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisa Zapatka","author_inst":"Trinity Health Of New England"},{"author_name":"Reginald Eadie","author_inst":"Trinity Health Of New England"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Crowell","author_inst":"Saint Francis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kendra Williams","author_inst":"Saint Francis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Wakefield","author_inst":"Saint Francis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lisa Cook","author_inst":"Saint Francis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Puff","author_inst":"Saint Francis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Syed A Hussain","author_inst":"Trinity Health Of New England"},{"author_name":"Samira Mubareka","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Allison McGeer","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mt.

Patients is Associated with Low Infectious Risk to Operators at a High-Volume Center Using an Aerosol-minimizing Protocol","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.30.20177543","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised concern for exposure to healthcare providers through aerosol generating procedures, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Current society guidelines recommended limiting use of BAL to reduce operators' risk for infection, yet data on the infection rate for providers after BAL is sparse. Since March 2020, our institution used a modified protocol to perform over 450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients. We therefore sought to describe the subsequent infectious risks to providers associated with BAL. Methods: Fifty-two pulmonary and critical care providers (faculty and fellows) at our tertiary-care, urban medical center were surveyed. Survey participants were asked to provide the number of BALs on COVID-19 patients they performed, the number of weeks they cared for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19, and the results of any SARS-CoV-2 testing that they received. Participants were asked to assess the difficulty of BAL on intubated COVID-19 patients as compared to routine ICU BAL using a numeric perceived difficulty score ranging from 1 (easier) to 10 (harder). Results: We received forty-seven responses from fifty-two surveyed (90% response rate), with 2 declining to participate. Many respondents (19\/45, 42%) spent >5 weeks on an ICU service with COVID-19 patients. The number of BALs performed by providers ranged from 0 to >60. Sixteen of the 35 providers (46%) who performed BALs underwent at least one nasopharyngeal (NP) swab to test for SARS-CoV-2, but none were positive. Twenty-seven of the 35 providers (77%) who performed BALs underwent SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, and only one (3.7%) was positive. Respondents indicated occasionally not being able to follow aerosol-minimizing steps but overall felt BALs in COVID-19 patients was only slightly more difficult than routine ICU BAL. Discussion: At a high-volume center having performed >450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients with aerosol-limiting precautions, our survey of bronchoscopists found no positive NP SARS-CoV-2 tests and only one positive antibody test result. While the optimal role for COVID-19 BAL remains to be determined, these data suggest that BAL can be safely performed in intubated COVID-19 patients if experienced providers take precautions to limit aerosol generation and wear personal protective equipment.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine A.

association of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers, not Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, with an increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.30.20182451","rel_abs":"Background. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 is the receptor of SARSCoV-2 for entry into lungs cells. Because ACE-2 may be modulated by ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection. Aim. This study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 with previous treatment with ACEI and ARB. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and tested by PCR. Patients were split into 2 groups, whether (group 1, n=484) or not (group 2, n=250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariate adjusted comparisons included a propensity score analysis. Results Age was 63.6 {+\/-} 18.7 years, and 302(44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% patients of group 1 and 2, respectively (P=0.28). A treatment with ARBs (20.7% versus 12.0%, respectively, OR 1.92, 95% confidence interval [1.23-2.98], p=0.004) was more frequent in patients of group 1 than in group 2. No difference was found for treatment with ACEIs (12.7% vs 15.7%, respectively, OR 0.81 [0.52-1.26], p=0.35). Propensity score matched multivariate logistic regression confirmed a significant association between COVID-19 and a previous treatment with ARBs (adjusted OR 2.18 [1.29-3.67], p=0.004). Significant interaction between ARBs and ACEIs for the risk of COVID-19 was observed in patients aged>60, women, and hypertensive patients. Conclusion . This study suggests that ACEIs and ARBs are not similarly associated with the COVID-19. In this retrospective series, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia received more frequently a previous treatment with ARBs, than patients without COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean-Louis GEORGES","author_inst":"Cardiology department, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Le Chesnay, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane

COVID-19 mitigation policies - is it too early to relax them, were the policies as effective as they could have been. Answering these questions about the past or crafting newer policy decisions in the future requires a quantification of how policy choices affect the spread of the infection. Policy landscape as well as the infection trajectories from different states and countries diverged so fast that comparing and learning from them has not been easy. In this work, we standardize and pool together the ensemble of lockdown and graded re-opening policies adopted by the 50 states of USA in any given week between 9th March and 9th August. Using artificial intelligence (AI) on this pooled data, we build a predictive model (R2training=0.79, R2test=0.76) for the weekly-averaged transmission rate of infections. Predictability conceptually raises the possibility of an evidence-based or data-driven mitigation policy-making by evaluating the relative merits of the different policy scenarios. Probing the predictions with interpretable AI highlights how factors such as the closing of bars or the use of masks influence transmission, effects which have been hard to decouple from the ensemble of policy instrument combinations. While acknowledging the limitations of our predictions as well as of the infection testing, we ask the theoretical question if the observed transmission rates in the states were as efficient as they could have been under various levels of restrictions, and if the mitigation policies of the states are overdesigned. The model can be further refined with a more detailed inclusion of geographies and policy compliances, as well as expanded as newer policies emerge.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"C.

the development of suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK). Design Cross-sectional observational study. Setting UK-based primary and secondary care. Participants HCWs aged [&ge;]18 years working between 1 February and 25 May 2020. Main outcome measures A composite endpoint of laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, or self-isolation or hospitalisation due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Results Of 6152 eligible responses, the composite endpoint was present in 1806 (29.4%) HCWs, of whom 49 (0.8%) were hospitalised, 459 (7.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 1776 (28.9%) reported self-isolation. The strongest risk factor associated with the presence of the primary composite endpoint was increasing frequency of contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE): ''Never'' (reference), ''Rarely'' (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, (95% confidence interval: 0.87 to 1.29)), ''Sometimes'' (1.7 (1.37 to 2.10)), ''Often'' (1.84 (1.28 to 2.63)), ''Always'' (2.93, (1.75 to 5.06)). Additionally, several comorbidities (cancer, respiratory disease, and obesity); working in a 'doctors' role; using public transportation for work; regular contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients; and lack of PPE were also associated with the presence of the primary endpoint. 1382 (22.5%) HCWs reported lacking access to PPE items while having clinical contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Overall, between 11,870 and 21,158 days of self-isolation were required by the cohort, equalling approximately 71 to 127 working days lost per 1000 working days. Conclusions Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was more common in HCWs than in the general population. Risk factors included inadequate PPE, which was reported by nearly a quarter of HCWs. Governments and policymakers must ensure adequate PPE is available as well as developing strategies to mitigate risk for high-risk HCWs during future COVID-19 waves.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin Kua","author_inst":"National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia, Royal College of Anaesthetists"},{"author_name":"Reshma

COVID-19 reached Brazil in February 2020 after spreading throughout Asia and Europe. The disease first struck in Brazil major cities, affecting high-income groups, subsequently spreading to the socially-vulnerable outlying areas. The objective of this preliminary study was to the estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in the Baixada Santista Metropolitan Area - RMBS, to inform policies for prevention and preparation of primary care, hospital services, hospital beds, intensive and critical care in a bid to reduce lethality. Methods: This study is the first of a four-phase cross-sectional survey to include all cities within the Baixada Santista metropolitan area. The probabilistic population-based sample was based on a 7% prevalence with a 2% delta, a 5% level of significance and 90% power, and considered the estimated population, stratified by age, gender and city. The sample was randomized in each city and street selection was based on data drawn from the 2010 Brazilian census. The serology test was chosen from the available test kits approved by the National Health Agency (ANS) of the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Information on socioeconomic characteristics, health service use, symptoms and adherence to social distancing measures was collected. All variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies and confidence intervals. Results: The final sample comprised 2,342 respondents with a mean age of 37.78 (19.98) years and equal gender distribution. Respondents predominantly lived in an abode with 4 or more rooms, 71.9% had an income of [&le;]3 minimum wages and no formal employment. Over half of the sample reported being reliant on the National Health Service (SUS) for health care, while 26.5% held private health insurance. Social distancing was practiced by 61.4% of respondents who answered this question. Seroprevalence measured was 1.4% for a 95% CI (0.93-1.93) based on mathematical estimates, with a ratio of 15 actual infections for every case notified, and lethality of 0.48%. Conclusion: Results revealed a flattening of the epidemiological curve in the region and high underreporting of cases.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karina

excess mortality due to COVID-19 in care homes. The case of Wallonia - Belgium.","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20183210","rel_abs":"COVID-19 became pandemic in 2020 and causes higher mortality in males (M) than females (F) and among older people. In some countries, like Belgium, more than half of COVID-19 confirmed or suspected deaths occurring in spring 2020 concerned residents of care homes. The high incidence in this population is certainly linked to its peculiar age structure but could also result from its poorer general health condition and\/or from a higher contamination through the staff of care homes, while protection equipment and testing capacity were initially limited. To address these issues, we used data from Wallonia (Belgium) to characterize the distribution of death rates among care home institutions, to compare the dynamics of deaths in and outside care homes, and to analyse how age and sex affected COVID-19 death rates inside and outside care homes. We also used annual death rates as a proxy for the health condition of each population. We found that: (1) COVID-19 death rate per institution varied widely from 0{per thousand} to 340{per thousand} (mean 43{per thousand}) and increased both with the size of the institution (number of beds) and with the importance of medical care provided. (2) 65% of COVID-19 deaths in Wallonia concerned residents of care homes where the outbreak started after but at a faster pace than the outbreak seen in the external population. (3) The impact of age on both annual and COVID-19 mortality closely follows exponential laws (i.e. Gompertz law) but mortality was much higher for the population living in care homes where the age effect was lower (mortality rate doubling every 20 years of age increment in care homes, 6 years outside them). (4) Both within and outside care homes, the ratio of M\/F death rates was 1.6 for annual mortality but reached 2.0 for COVID-19 mortality, a ratio consistent among both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths. (5) When reported to the annual death rate per sex and age, the COVID-19 relative mortality was little affected by age and reached 24% (M) and 18% (F) of their respective annual rate in nursing homes, while these percentages reduced to 10% (M) and 9% (F) in homes for elderly people (with less medical assistance), and to 5% (M) and 4% (F) outside of care homes. In conclusion, a c. 130x higher COVID-19 mortality rate found in care homes compared to the outside population can be attributed to the near multiplicative combination of: (1) a 11x higher mortality due to the old age of its residents, (2) a 3.8x higher mortality due to the low average health condition of its residents, and (3) probably a 3.5x higher infection rate (1.6x in homes for elderly people) due to the transmission by its staff, a problem more acute in large institutions. Our results highlight that nursing home residents should be treated as a very specific population, both for epidemiological studies and to take preventive measures, due to their extreme vulnerability to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olivier J.
