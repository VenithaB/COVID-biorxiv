Our results indicate that, prior to significant public health interventions, the reproductive numbers for a majority (10) of these outbreaks are similar, with median posterior estimates ranging between 1.4 and 2.8. These estimates provide a view which is complementary to that provided by those based on traditional line listing data. The genomic-based view is arguably less susceptible to biases resulting from differences in testing protocols, testing intensity, and import of cases into the community of interest. In the analyses reported here, the genomic data primarily provides information regarding which samples belong to a particular outbreak. We observe that once these outbreaks are identified, the sampling dates carry the majority of the information regarding the reproductive number. Finally, we provide genome-based estimates of the cumulative case counts for each outbreak, which allow us to speculate on the amount of unreported infections within the populations housing each outbreak. These results indicate that for the majority (7) of the populations studied, the number of recorded cases is much bigger than the estimated cumulative case counts, suggesting the presence of unsequenced pathogen diversity in these populations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy G Vaughan","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Scir\u00e9","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sarah A Nadeau","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tanja Stadler","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.12.20192914","rel_title":"A snap shot of space and time dynamics of COVID-19 risk in Malawi.

Methods: The study used publicly available data of COVID-19 cases for the period from 24th June to 20th August, 2020. Semiparametric spatial temporal models were fitted to the number of weekly confirmed cases as an outcome data, with time and location as independent variables. Results: The study found significant main effect of location and time with the two interacting. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 showed major cities being at greater risk than rural areas. Over time the COVID-19 risk was increasing then decreasing in most districts with the rural districts being consistently at lower risk. Conclusion. Future or present strategies to avert the spread of COVID-19 should target major cities by limiting international exposure. In addition, the focus should be on time points that had shown high risk.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alfred Ngwira Sr.","author_inst":"Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources"},{"author_name":"Felix Kumwenda Sr.","author_inst":"Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources"},{"author_name":"Eddons Munthali Sr.","author_inst":"Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources"},{"author_name":"Duncan Nkolokosa Sr.","author_inst":"Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.12.20193250","rel_title":"Environment influences SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.12.20193250","rel_abs":"As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, it is increasingly important to understand the factors that influence its transmission. Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, UV radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States of America, we explore correlates of transmission across USA states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modelling. We find that policy intervention (`lockdown') and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but in their absence lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of SARS-CoV-2, its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas P Smith","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Seth Flaxman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Amanda S Gallinat","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia P Kinosian","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Stemkovski","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"H Juliette T Unwin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Tristem","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William D Pearse","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.12.20191973","rel_title":"Inequality in access to health and care services during lockdown - Findings from the COVID-19 survey in five UK national longitudinal studies","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.12.20191973","rel_abs":"Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a second wave.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Constantin-Cristian Topriceanu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wong","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"James C Moon","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Alun Hughes","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"David Bann","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Nishi Chaturvedi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Praveetha Patalay","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Conti","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Captur","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Tristem","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William D Pearse","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193680","rel_title":"Lack of consideration of sex and gender in clinical trials for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20193680","rel_abs":"Sex and gender differences impact the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality.

In this study, we analyzed available complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences using the CpG index as a signature of Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) activity to examine population variations in innate intracellular antiviral competencies. The result suggests that differential ZAP activity may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa, Asia, and pools of asymptomatic patients had I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity, while SARS-CoV-2 sequences from North America and Intensive Care Unit or Deceased patients had I_CpG signature of low ZAP activity. ZAP activity is linked to the interferon system. Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. It may also provide some insight into the discrepancies between invitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of candidate therapies and performance in clinical trials. Furthermore, our results suggest that asymptomatic patients may paradoxically shed a more dangerous virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaibu Oricha Bello","author_inst":"College Of Health Sciences, Usmanu Danfodiyo University"},{"author_name":"Ehimario Igumbor","author_inst":"School of Public Health, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Yusuf Yahaya Deeni","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology & Biotechnology, Federal University Dutse, PMB 7156, Jigawa State, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Chinwe Lucia Ochu","author_inst":"Nigeria Center for Disease Control, Abuja, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Ayodele Popoola","author_inst":".

Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. Objective: Identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of 1,022 COVID-19 patient admissions from 14 Midwest U.S. hospitals between March 7, 2020 and August 25, 2020. Methods: Ensemble clustering was performed on a set of 33 vitals and labs variables collected within 72 hours of admission. K-means based consensus clustering was used to identify three clinical phenotypes. Principal component analysis was performed on the average covariance matrix of all imputed datasets to visualize clustering and variable relationships. Multinomial regression models were fit to further compare patient comorbidities across phenotype classification. Multivariable models were fit to estimate the association between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. Main outcomes and measures: Phenotype classification (I, II, III), patient characteristics associated with phenotype assignment, in-hospital complications, and clinical outcomes including ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Results: The database included 1,022 patients requiring hospital admission with COVID-19 (median age, 62.1 [IQR: 45.9-75.8] years; 481 [48.6%] male, 412 [40.3%] required ICU admission, 437 [46.7%] were white). Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III); 236 [23.1%] patients had phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients had phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients had phenotype III. When grouping comorbidities by organ system, patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype III (p=0.002), while patients with hematologic (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and cardiac (p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype I. The adjusted odds of respiratory (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and metabolic (p<0.001) complications were highest for patients with phenotype I, followed by phenotype II. Patients with phenotype I had a far greater odds of hepatic (p<0.001) and hematological (p=0.02) complications than the other two phenotypes. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR: 7.30, 95% CI: (3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR: 2.57, 95% CI: (1.10-6.00), p=0.03) increases in the hazard of death, respectively, when compared to phenotype III. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19, three clinical phenotypes were identified. Future research is urgently needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical practice and trial design.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth R Lusczek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicholas E Ingraham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Basil Karam","author_inst":"Medical College of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Proper","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Lianne Siegel","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Erika Helgeson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sahar Lotfi-Emran","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Emily J.

Understanding the role of weather factors in COVID-19 in Brazil is helpful in the long-term mitigation strategy of COVID-19 in other tropical countries because Brazil experienced early large-scale outbreak among tropical countries. Recent COVID-19 studies indicate that relevant weather factors such as temperature, humidity, UV Index (UVI), precipitation, ozone, pollution and cloud cover may influence the spread of COVID-19. Yet, the magnitude and direction of those associations remain inconclusive. Furthermore, there is only limited research exploring the impact of these weather factors in a tropical country like Brazil. In this observational study, we outline the roles of 7 relevant weather factors including temperature, humidity, UVI, precipitation, ozone, pollution (visibility) and cloud cover in COVID-19 deaths in Brazil. Methods: We use a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 27 administrative regions in Brazil across 182 days (n=3882) and analyze the role of relevant weather factors by using daily cumulative COVID-19 deaths in Brazil as the dependent variable. We carry out robustness checks using case-fatality-rate (CFR) as the dependent variable. Findings: We control for all time-fixed and various time-varying region-specific factors confounding factors. We observe a significant negative association of COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate in Brazil with weather factors - UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover. Specifically, a unit increase in UVI, maximum temperature, and ozone independently associate with 6.0 percentage points [p<0.001], 1.8 percentage points [p<0.01] and 0.3 percentage points [p<0. 1] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Further, a unit percentage increase in cloud cover associates with a decline of 0.148 percentage points [p<0.05] in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Surprisingly, contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of any association between COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate and humidity, visibility and precipitation. We find our results to be consistent even when we use the CFR as the dependent variable. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover in mitigating COVID-19 deaths, even in a tropical country like Brazil. We observe these results to be consistent across various model specifications, especially for UVI and cloud cover, even after incorporating additional time-varying weather parameters such as dewpoint, pressure, wind speed and wind gust. These results could guide health-related policy decision making in Brazil as well as similar tropical countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Carmen Hernandez-Cardenas,","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Carlos Torruco-Sotelo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Felipe Jurado","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Hector Serna-secundino","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Cristina Aguilar","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Jose Garcia-Olanzaran","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Diana Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Emma Jones","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Chipman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"R.

At the scale of a global pandemic, the co-occurrence of natural disasters is inevitable. However, the impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19 has not been extensively evaluated using agent based epidemiology models. Methods: We create an agent-based epidemiology model based on both COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological data and geographic data. We first model 35 scenarios with varying natural disaster timing and duration for a COVID-19 outbreak in a theoretical region. We then evaluate the potential effect of an eruption of Vesuvius volcano on the spread of COVID-19 in Campania, Italy. Our objective is to determine if the occurrence of a natural disaster during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase infection cases and disease related fatalities. Results: In a majority of cases, the occurrence of a natural disaster increases the number of disease related fatalities. When the natural disaster occurs at the beginning of the outbreak within a given region, there is little to no increase in the progression of disease spread. However, the occurrence of a natural disaster close to the peak of infections may increase the number of fatalities by more than five-fold. In a theoretical test case, for a natural disaster that occurred fifty days after first infection case, the median increase in fatalities is 2%, 59%, and 180% for a 2, 14, and 31-day long natural disaster respectively, when compared to the no natural disaster scenario. Conclusion: We propose that the compound risk from natural disasters is greatest in the case of already widespread disease outbreak. The key risk factors for increase in spread of infection and disease related fatalities are the timing of the natural disaster relative to the peak in infections and the duration of the natural disaster.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Lekaashree Rambabu","author_inst":"National Health Service Tayside"},{"author_name":"Carlos Torruco-Sotelo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Felipe Jurado","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Hector Serna-secundino","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Cristina Aguilar","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Jose Garcia-Olanzaran","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Diana Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Emma Jones","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Chipman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"R.

Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was a 28% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eleanor Nuzum","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Martin","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Broadbent","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert Stewart","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Hector Serna-secundino","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Cristina Aguilar","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Jose Garcia-Olanzaran","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Diana Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias"},{"author_name":"Emma Jones","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Chipman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"R.

Digital contact tracing (DCT) uses tools such as cell-phone applications to improve tracing speed and reach. We model the impact of DCT on the spread of the virus for a large epidemiological parameter space consistent with current literature on SARS-CoV-2. We also model DCT in combination with random testing (RT) and social distancing (SD). Modelling is done with two independently developed individual-based (stochastic) models that use the Monte Carlo technique, benchmarked against each other and against two types of deterministic models. For current best estimates of the number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers (approximately 40\\%), their contagiousness (similar to that of symptomatic carriers), the reproductive number before interventions (R0 at least 3) we find that DCT must be combined with other interventions such as SD and\/or RT to push the reproductive number below one. At least 60\\% of the population would have to use the DCT system for its effect to become significant. On its own, DCT cannot bring the reproductive number below 1 unless nearly the entire population uses the DCT system and follows quarantining and testing protocols strictly. For lower uptake of the DCT system, DCT still reduces the number of people that become infected. When DCT is deployed in a population with an ongoing outbreak where O(0.1\\%) of the population have already been infected, the gains of the DCT intervention come at the cost of requiring up to 15% of the population to be quarantined (in response to being traced) on average each day for the duration of the epidemic, even when there is sufficient testing capability to test every traced person.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tina R Pollmann","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Julia Pollmann","author_inst":"University clinic Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Wiesinger","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Christian Haack","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Lolian Shtembari","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Physics"},{"author_name":"Andrea Turcati","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Birgit Neumair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Stephan Meighen-Berger","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Zattera","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Neumair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Uljana Apel","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Augustine Okolie","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Johannes Mueller","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, Helmholtz Center Munich"},{"author_name":"Stefan Schoenert","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Resconi","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Monica I Lupei","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20186692","rel_title":"Secondary traumatic stress and burnout in healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20186692","rel_abs":"Aims: To assess the level of professional burnout and secondary traumatic stress, and to identify potential risk or protective factors among health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study, based on an online survey, collected demographic data and mental distress outcomes from 184 HCWs from May 1st, 2020, to June,15th, 2020, from 45 different countries. The degree of secondary traumatization was assessed using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), the degrees of perceived stress and burnout were assessed with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk and protective factors for STS. Results: 184 HCWs (M=90; Age mean: 46.45; SD:11.02) completed the survey. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of secondary traumatic stress (41.3%), emotional exhaustion (56.0%), and depersonalization (48.9%). The prevalence of secondary traumatic stress in frontline HCWs was 47.5% while in HCWs working in other units it was 30.3% (p<.023); additionally, the prevalence of the same outcome was 67.1% for the HCWs exposed to patients' death and 32.9% for those HCWs which were not exposed to the same condition (p<.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion and exposure to patients' death remained as significant predictors in the final model for secondary traumatic stress (adjusted R2 =0.537, p<0.001). Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs facing patients' physical pain, psychological suffering, and death are more likely to develop secondary traumatization.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Marzetti","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Guido Vagheggini","author_inst":"Auxilium Vitae Rehabilitation Centre"},{"author_name":"Ciro Conversano","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Mario Miccoli","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Angelo Gemignani","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Ciacchini","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Panait","author_inst":"Fondazione Volterra Ricerche ONLUS"},{"author_name":"Graziella Orru","author_inst":"University of Pisa"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Zattera","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Neumair","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Uljana Apel","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Augustine Okolie","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Johannes Mueller","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, Helmholtz Center Munich"},{"author_name":"Stefan Schoenert","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Elisa Resconi","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Monica I Lupei","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193615","rel_title":"Alternative or Complementary Role of Serological Rapid Antibody Test in the Management of Possible COVID-19 Cases","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20193615","rel_abs":"Background: Although the gold diagnostic method for COVID-19 is accepted as the detection of viral particles by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serology testing for SARS-CoV-2 is at increased demand.

In this study, we aimed to report the features of the patients that were diagnosed and treated as possible COVID-19 cases whose multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples were negative by RT-PCR but serological IgM\/IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by rapid antibody test. Method: We retrospectively analyzed eighty suspected COVID-19 cases that have at least two negative consecutive COVID-19 PCR test and were subjected to serological rapid antibody test. Result: The specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as positive in twenty-two patients. The mean age of patient group was 63.2+-13.1 years old with male \/female ratio 11\/11. Cough was the most common symptom with 90.9%. Most common presenting chest CT findings were bilateral ground glass opacities (77.2%) and alveolar consolidations (50.09%).

Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a direct Cas9 based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences and identifying nucleobase identity without the requirement of trans-cleavage activity of reporter molecules. We demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) including heterozygous carriers of a mutation and present a simple design strategy in the form of a web-tool, JATAYU, for its implementation. FELUDA is semi quantitative, can be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and deployed for versatile applications such as infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Using a lateral flow readout within 1h, FELUDA shows 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity across all range of viral loads in clinical samples. In combination with RT-RPA and a smartphone application True Outcome Predicted via Strip Evaluation (TOPSE), we present a prototype for FELUDA for CoV-2 detection at home.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohd.

In this research, we report sensing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus in seconds via an electrochemical platform consisting of gold micropillar array electrodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide and functionalized with recombinant viral antigens. The array electrodes are fabricated by Aerosol Jet (AJ) nanoparticle 3D printing, where gold nanoparticles (3-5nm) are assembled in 3D space, sintered, and integrated with a microfluidic device. The device is shown to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at concentrations down to 1pM via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and read by a smartphone-based user interface. In addition, the sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive testing of multiple antibody samples using the same sensor. The detection time for the two antibodies tested in this work is 11.5 seconds. S1 protein sensing of its antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies nor with proteins such as Nucleocapsid antibody and Interleukin-6 protein. The proposed sensing platform is generic and can also be used for the rapid detection of biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika, which will benefit the public health.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Azahar Ali","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Chunshan Hu","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Sanjida Jahan","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Bin Yuan","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Sadeq Saleh","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Enguo Ju","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shou-Jiang Gao","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rahul P Panat","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Saumya Sharma","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sunaina Singh","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sundaram Acharya","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanjan Paul","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poorti Kathpalia","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Meghali Aich","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Paras Sehgal","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gyan Ranjan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rahul C Bhoyar","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"- Indian CoV2 Genomics & Genetic Epidemiology (IndiCovGEN) Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Khushboo Singhal","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Harsha Lad","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Kumar Patra","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110029, India"},{"author_name":"Giriraj Ratan Chandak","author_inst":"CSIR-Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Uppal Road, Hyderabad, Telengana 500007"},{"author_name":"Bala Pesala","author_inst":"CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Debojyoti Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maiti","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20193805","rel_title":"Genome sequencing of sewage detects regionally prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20193805","rel_abs":"Viral genome sequencing has guided our understanding of the spread and extent of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the US or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside of CA, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing. These results demonstrate that epidemiological surveillance through wastewater sequencing can aid in tracking exact viral strains in an epidemic context.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Crits-Christoph","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Rose S Kantor","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew R Olm","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Oscar N Whitney","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Basem Al-Shayeb","author_inst":"Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Yue C Lou","author_inst":"Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Avi Flamholz","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lauren C Kennedy","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hannah Greenwald","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adrian Hinkle","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Hetzel","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sara Spitzer","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeffery Koble","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Asako Tan","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Fred Hyde","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gary Schroth","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Scott Kuersten","author_inst":"Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jillian F Banfield","author_inst":"Innovative Genomics Institute, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA"},{"author_name":"Kara L Nelson","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Harsha Lad","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Kumar Patra","author_inst":"CSIR-Sickle Cell Anemia Mission Laboratory, Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, Bilaspur 495001, Chhattisgarh, India"},{"author_name":"Govind Makharia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110029, India"},{"author_name":"Giriraj Ratan Chandak","author_inst":"CSIR-Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Uppal Road, Hyderabad, Telengana 500007"},{"author_name":"Bala Pesala","author_inst":"CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Debojyoti Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maiti","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.13.20188334","rel_title":"Self-collected Saline Gargle Samples as an Alternative to Healthcare Worker Collected Nasopharyngeal Swabs for COVID-19 Diagnosis in Outpatients","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.13.20188334","rel_abs":"Background: We assessed the performance, stability, and user acceptability of swab-independent self-collected saliva and saline mouth rinse\/gargle sample types for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in adults and school-aged children. Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. A portion of participants were also asked about sample acceptability. Samples underwent molecular testing using multiple assays. Saline mouth rinse\/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse\/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39\/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26\/33). Both saline mouth rinse\/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse\/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1). Conclusion: Saline mouth rinse\/gargle samples demonstrated the highest combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance when compared with saliva and HCW collected NP swabs. This sample type is a promising swab-independent option, particularly for outpatient self-collection in adults and school aged children.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M Goldfarb","author_inst":"Children's and Women's Health Centre of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Peter Tilley","author_inst":"Childrens and Womens Health centre of BC"},{"author_name":"Ghada N.

We found evidence of heterogeneity acting at multiple levels: in the number of potentially infectious contacts per index case, and in the per-contact risk of infection. Incorporating these findings in simple mathematical models of disease transmission reveals that these heterogeneities act in combination to strongly influence transmission dynamics. Standard approaches, such as representing heterogeneity through secondary case distributions, could be biased by neglecting these underlying interactions between heterogeneities. We discuss implications for policy, and for more efficient contact tracing in resource-constrained settings such as India.

Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~50%. Slight increases in mask adherence and\/or efficacy above current levels would reduce the effective reproductive number (Re) substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who get infected despite masking, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy would only lower Re if dosed as post-exposure prophylaxis and if given to ~50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Goyal","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel B Reeves","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"E Fabian Cardozo Ojeda","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Bryan T Mayer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Schiffer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Heather Pedersen","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Abhilasha Pabbi","author_inst":"BC Children's Hospital & BC Women's Hospital & Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Hannam-Clark","author_inst":"BC Children's Hospital & BC Women's Hospital & Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Marthe K.

Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shilpa Rao","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ian Hoskins","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Daniela Garcia","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Tori Tonn","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Hakan Ozadam","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Elif Sarinay Cenik","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Can Cenik","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Samina Nazir","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Carola Vinuesa","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cook","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Bala Pesala","author_inst":"CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Debojyoti Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maiti","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.295824","rel_title":"SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein forms condensates with viral genomic RNA","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.295824","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes COVID-19, a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with unstructured RNA, it forms mesh like-structures with viral RNA strands that contain secondary structure elements. Cross-linking mass spectrometry identified an intrinsically-disordered region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. By screening 1,200 FDA approved drugs in vitro, we identified a kinase inhibitor nilotinib, which affects the morphology of N condensates in vitro and disrupts phase separation of the N protein in vivo. These results indicate that the N protein compartmentalizes viral RNA in infected cells through liquid-liquid phase separation, and this process can be disrupted by a possible drug candidate.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Jack","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Luke S Ferro","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Michael J Trnka","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Eddie Wehri","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Amrut Nadgir","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Katelyn Costa","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Julia Schaletzky","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Yildiz","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Carola Vinuesa","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cook","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Bala Pesala","author_inst":"CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Debojyoti Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maiti","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.296327","rel_title":"The Coronavirus Network Explorer: Mining a large-scale knowledge graph for effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host cell function","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.296327","rel_abs":"Building on recent work that identified human host proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in the context of an affinity-purification mass spectrometry screen, we use a machine learning-based approach to connect the viral proteins to relevant biological functions and diseases in a large-scale knowledge graph derived from the biomedical literature.

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected up to 26 million people worldwide; yet, there is no clinically approved drug or vaccine available. Therefore, a rapid and coordinated effort to re-purpose clinically approved drugs that prevent or disrupt these critical entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with human ACE2, could potentially accelerate the identification and clinical advancement of prophylactic and\/or treatment options against COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures against viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. Herein, we discovered that Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), and its progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), both clinically approved drugs are potent effective modulators of the key interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2. We also found that both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect at micromolar concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH; we report for the first time that the BHH and AMB pharmacophore has the capacity to target and modulate yet another key protein-protein interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways into host cells. Altogether, the potent efficacy, excellent safety and pharmacologic profile of both drugs along with their affordability and availability, makes them promising candidates for drug repurposing as possible prophylactic and\/or treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omonike A Olaleye","author_inst":"Texas Southern University"},{"author_name":"Manvir Kaur","author_inst":"Texas Southern University"},{"author_name":"Collins Chidi Onyenaka","author_inst":"Texas Southern University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Quake","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Carlos Simon","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Valencia"},{"author_name":"Jeff Green","author_inst":"QIAGEN"},{"author_name":"Julia Schaletzky","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Yildiz","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Carola Vinuesa","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cook","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Coatsworth","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Paul Myles","author_inst":"Alfred Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universistatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Leif Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Russell Gruen","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Graham Mann","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Amee George","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gardiner","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ian Cockburn","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Bala Pesala","author_inst":"CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Debojyoti Chakraborty","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maiti","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"pharmacology and toxicology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.293951","rel_title":"Non-permissive SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural cells in the developing human brain and neurospheres","rel_date":"2020-09-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.293951","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially described as a viral infection of the respiratory tract. It is now known, however, that many other biological systems are affected, including the central nervous system (CNS). Neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but its neurotropic potential is still debated. Here, we investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain from an infant patient deceased from COVID-19. The susceptibility to virus infection was compatible with the expression levels of viral receptor ACE2, which is increased in the ChP in comparison to other brain areas. To better comprehend the dynamics of the viral infection in neural cells, we exposed human neurospheres to SARS-CoV-2. Similarly to the human tissue, we found viral RNA in neurospheres, although viral particles in the culture supernatant were not infective. Based on our observations in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 does not generate productive infection in developing neural cells and that infection of ChP weakens the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier allowing viruses, immune cells, and cytokines to access the CNS, causing neural damage in the young brain.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jairo R Temerozo","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Ismael C.
