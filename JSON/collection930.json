This influences all the parameters that govern the statistical models used for controlling the infection. Purpose: This work proposes two models based on experimental data. The Logistic Model it is used to obtain three parameters of the epidemic cycle of COVID-19, namely: the final count for the total infected, the daily infection rate and the lag time. Complimentary, a novel inventory model is proposed to calculate the number of infective persons, as well as to determine the incubation period. Methods: The data on epidemic cycles of Germany, Italy, and Sweden are treated previously by the Moving Average Method with Initial value (MAMI), then a variation of the Logistic Model, obtained through curve-fitting, is used to obtain the three parameters. The inventory model is introduced to calculate the actual number of infected persons and the behavior of the incubation period is analyzed. Results: After comparing data from the three countries it is possible to determine the actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles for each one, determine the size of the incubation period, as well as to determine the total number of infective persons during the cycle. Conclusions: The actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles in the countries analyzed are determined, the total number of infected is determined, and it is statistically proven that the incubation cycle for Sars-CoV-2 is five days.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rogerio Atem De Carvalho","author_inst":"Instituto Federal Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Atem De Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Berg de Almeida","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Botucatu School of Medicine, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP).

Here we report biological and epidemiological aspects of this mutation. Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we were able to confirm that the G614 variant of the Spike protein is markedly more infectious than the ancestral D614 variant. We demonstrate by molecular modelling that the replacement of aspartate by glycine in position 614 facilitates the transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To understand whether the increased infectivity of the D614 variant explains its epidemiological success, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G\/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D\/P variant. There was no significant correlation between reported COVID mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G\/L variant. However, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, the G\/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sten Ilmj\u00e4rv","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Fabien Abdul","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Silvia Acosta-Guti\u00e9rrez","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London; Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London; Institute of Structural and Molecula"},{"author_name":"Carolina Estarellas","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Galdadas","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London"},{"author_name":"Marina Casimir","author_inst":"Neurix SA"},{"author_name":"Marco Alessandrini","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Francesco Luigi Gervasio","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University College London; Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Karl-Heinz Krause","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva; Division of Infectious Disease and Dept. of Diagnostics, Geneva University Ho"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.23.20180174","rel_title":"The Futures of the Pandemic in the USA : A Timed Intervention Model","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.23.20180174","rel_abs":"We propose a novel Timed Intervention SPEIQRD extended SEIR model for predicting the evolution of the Covid 19 Pandemic in the USA.

While evidence suggests masks help curb the spread of respiratory pathogens, research is limited. Face masks have quickly become a topic of public debate as government mandates have started requiring their use. Here we investigate the association between self-reported mask wearing, social distancing and community SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States, as well as the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. Methods: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered June 3 through July 31, 2020 via web platform. Surveys queried individuals' likelihood to wear a face mask to the grocery store or with family and friends. Responses (N=378,207) were aggregated by week and state and combined with measures of the instantaneous reproductive number (Rt), social distancing proxies, respondent demographics and other potential sources of confounding. We fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask wearing and community transmission control (Rt <1) for each state and week. Multiple sensitivity analyses were considered to corroborate findings across mask wearing definitions, Rt estimators and data sources. Additionally, mask wearing in 12 states was evaluated two weeks before and after statewide mandates. Results: We find an upward trend in mask usage across the U.S., although uptake varies by geography and demographic groups. A multivariate logistic model controlling for social distancing and other variables found a 10% increase in mask wearing was associated with a 3.53 (95% CI: 2.03, 6.43) odds of transmission control (Rt <1). We also find that communities with high mask wearing and social distancing have the highest predicted probability of a controlled epidemic. These positive associations were maintained across sensitivity analyses. Segmented regression analysis of mask wearing found no statistical change following mandates, however the positive trend of increased mask wearing over time was preserved. Conclusion: Widespread utilization of face masks combined with social distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Mask wearing rose separately from government mask mandates, suggesting supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximize mask adoption and disrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially as social distancing measures are relaxed.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Rader","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Laura F White","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Michael R Burns","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jack Chen","author_inst":"SurveyMonkey"},{"author_name":"Joe Brilliant","author_inst":"SurveyMonkey"},{"author_name":"Jon Cohen","author_inst":"SurveyMonkey"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Larry Brilliant","author_inst":"Pandefense Advisors"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.22.20180000","rel_title":"IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC LED LOCKDOWN ON THE LIFESTYLE OF ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.22.20180000","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to study affect of COVID 19 pandemic on lifestyle of young adults and adolescent.

Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 testing is performed during clinical encounters with symptomatic individuals, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance and can effectively surveil communities with less temporal lag than other surveillance methods. However, epidemiologically-defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Methods: Herein we describe methods for developing a geographically-resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky which may have general applicability for cities throughout the United States. This approach was developed by the selection of sampling locations along sewer lines transporting raw wastewater from geographically and demographically distinct areas that correspond with locations where random testing of residents occurs. Conclusions: Development of this protocol for population-level sampling for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater can be utilized to inform consistent wastewater monitoring among cities for up-to-date and geographically-resolved information on COVID-19 prevalence within communities. This information could substantially supplement public health surveillance of COVID-19 and thus serve to better guide targeted mitigation strategies throughout the United States.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ray A Yeager","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Rochelle H Holm","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Kumar Saurabh","author_inst":"James Graham Brown Canter Center, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Joshua L Fuqua","author_inst":"Center for Predictive Medicine, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Daymond Talley","author_inst":"Louisville\/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District, Morris Forman Water Quality Treatment Center"},{"author_name":"Aruni Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Ted R Smith","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Larry Brilliant","author_inst":"Pandefense Advisors"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20176321","rel_title":"Suitability of Google Trends \u2122 for digital surveillance during ongoing COVID-19 epidemic: a case study from India","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20176321","rel_abs":"Background: India went into the largest population-level lockdown on 25th March 2020 in response to the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Digital surveillance has been shown to be useful to supplement the traditional surveillance. Google Trends  (GT) is one such platform reported to be useful during pandemics of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. Objective: We used GT to correlate the information seeking behaviour regarding COVID-19 of Indians with curiosity and apprehensiveness generated through media coverage as well as status of the epidemic both at national and state levels. Methods: We retrieved GT data between 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020 for India using a comprehensive search strategy. We obtained data on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org websites. We explored the trends of COVID-19 in the form of relative search volume (RSV) from GT platform and correlated them with media reports. We used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between Google search terms and daily new COVID-19 cases and daily tests for 14 days. Results: Peaks in RSV correlated with media coverage or government declarations suggestive of curiosity and apprehensiveness both at national level and high-burden states. High time-lag correlation was observed between both the daily reported number of tests and cases and RSV for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'' and ''lockdown'' at national level. Similar high time-lag correlation was observed for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''Corona'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'', ''lockdown'' in five high-burden states. Conclusion: This study reveals the advantages of infodemiology using GT to monitor an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19 in India. Google searches in India during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reflects mostly curiosity and apprehension of citizens. GT can also complement traditional surveillance in India as well as high burden states.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Parmeshwar D Satpathy","author_inst":"AIIMS BHOPAL"},{"author_name":"Sanjeev Kumar","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Prasad","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Joshua L Fuqua","author_inst":"Center for Predictive Medicine, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Daymond Talley","author_inst":"Louisville\/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District, Morris Forman Water Quality Treatment Center"},{"author_name":"Aruni Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Ted R Smith","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Larry Brilliant","author_inst":"Pandefense Advisors"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.23.20180307","rel_title":"Hesitant or not?

As hospitalizations for COVID-19-related illness continue to increase, many recent reports indicate the supply of PPE is persistently and significantly less than the demand. These PPE shortages encouraged communities of 3D printing experts and hobbyists to design and distribute homemade, 3D-printed PPE, including N95 mask substitutes. The mask presented, the Kansas City Mask (KC Mask), is one such product which was created from the maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This report discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the KC Mask design and its usage in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods: The KC Mask was adapted from a similar design called the Montana Mask. Mask components were 3D printed and assembled then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, MO as a proof of concept. Results: The QLFT was successful and the KC Mask was approved for use by pandemic response administration staff at the hospital. Fortunately, the KC Mask has not required wide utilization, however, because supply chains for Kansas City area hospitals have, at the time of this publication, not yet been exhausted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The results of Truman Medical Center approval of the KC Mask are promising for this N95 stop-gap substitute. Although further analysis and study is needed for this design, persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitate an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for the KC Mask as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse the KC Mask as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage based on CDC guidelines.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiv Dalla","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brandon Bacon","author_inst":"University of Missouri - Kansas City, Truman Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jack M Ayres","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Holmstead","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Alan J Ahlberg Elliot","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Rabin","author_inst":"City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer Kimball","author_inst":"Emerson College, Boston, Mass, USA"},{"author_name":"Ayman El-Mohandes","author_inst":"City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.22.20179994","rel_title":"Teamwork in the manufacturing workplace may hinder social distance","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.22.20179994","rel_abs":"The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections show no signs of stopping. Therefore, if the era of With-Colona will continue for a while, we must consider how to deal with this disaster well. The practice of social distance is one of the powerful tools for that purpose. In previous research, analysis of the factors that influence social distance has also been carried out using information from the US occupation information site O*NET. However, they targeted all industries, not specific industries. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the factors that influence Physical Proximity in the manufacturing industry, which has a large impact on the economy given the scale of employment. As the method, first, exploratory factor analysis is performed using O*NET information, and the extracted 7 variables, Sitting Work, Adverse Conditions, Information Processing, Bridging Work, Teamwork, Response to Aggression, and Intelligent Work, are used in the regression analysis. As a result, it was shown that Teamwork is the biggest factor that influences Physical Proximity. Also, Adverse Conditions and Response to Aggression showed a positive correlation and Sitting Work showed a negative correlation. By job type, Maintenance, Installation & Repair tended to have higher Physical Proximity than Manufacturing Production Process Development, Production & Quality Assurance.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keisuke Kokubun","author_inst":"Economic Research Institute, Japan Society for the Promotion of Machine Industry"},{"author_name":"Brandon Bacon","author_inst":"University of Missouri - Kansas City, Truman Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jack M Ayres","author_inst":"University of Kansas School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Holmstead","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Alan J Ahlberg Elliot","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Rabin","author_inst":"City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer Kimball","author_inst":"Emerson College, Boston, Mass, USA"},{"author_name":"Ayman El-Mohandes","author_inst":"City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.23.20180299","rel_title":"The health sector cost of different policy responses to COVID-19 in low- and middle- income countries","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.23.20180299","rel_abs":"Much attention has focussed in recent months on the impact that COVID-19 has on health sector capacity, including critical care bed capacity and resources such as personal protective equipment.

Here we present estimates of the total costs of COVID-19 response in low- and middle-income countries for different scenarios of COVID-19 mitigation over a one year period. We find costs vary substantially by setting, but in some settings even mitigation scenarios place a substantial fiscal impact on the health system. We conclude that the choices facing many low- and middle- income countries, without further rapid emergency financial support, are stark, between fully funding an effective COVID-19 reponse or other core essential health services.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Torres Rueda","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sedona Sweeney","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fiammetta Bozzani","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Vassall","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alan J Ahlberg Elliot","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Rabin","author_inst":"City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer Kimball","author_inst":"Emerson College, Boston, Mass, USA"},{"author_name":"Ayman El-Mohandes","author_inst":"City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Moritz UG Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jared B Hawkins","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.23.20180497","rel_title":"Bayesian Estimation of the Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.23.20180497","rel_abs":"Accurately estimating the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of appropriate methods.

We propose a deterministic linear model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. The linearity assumption makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John E.

Aim and Methods: We estimated the impact of the current treatments on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 by a meta-analysis. The comprehensive search included studies reporting clinical features and treatment strategies published from January 21, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Results: We included 52 studies that involved 13,966 COVID-19 patients. We found that the most prevalent treatments were antivirals (proportion: 0.74, 95% CI : [0.65, 0.83]) and antibiotics (proportion: 0.73, 95% CI: [0.62, 0.83]). The COVID-19 severity increased among patients taking glucocorticoids (risk ratio (RR) = 1.71, 95% CI: [1.06, 2.76]) or immunoglobulins (RR = 3.83, 95% CI: [1.27, 11.53]), and renal replacement therapy (RRT) and glucocorticoids increased the length of ICU stay (RRT : RR= 11.89, 95% CI: [3.26, 43.39]; glucocorticoids: RR = 3.10, 95% CI: [1.52, 6.29]). The COVID-19 severity and mortality increased among patients taking tocilizumab (severity: F = 25.53, P = 0.02; mortality: F = 19.37, P = 0.02). The most effective treatment was the combination of arbidol with lopinavir\/ritonavir compared with placebo (mean difference = 0.5, 95% CI [-0.60, 1.66]), and the safest combination was remdesivir and lopinavir\/ritonavir (RR= 0.78, 95% CI [0.32, 1.91]).

This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Study Participants and Methods We investigated the effect of a three-week 200 mg dose of thiamine in lowering the Th17 response in sixteen DC (proinflammatory origin due to heavy alcohol drinking) patients; and eight healthy control\/volunteers (HV) as a pilot clinical-translational investigation. To further investigate, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the effectiveness of thiamine treatment in lowering the Th17 proinflammatory response in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) treated with ethanol. In this in vitro study, 100 mg\/day equivalent (0.01 ug\/ml) thiamine was used. Based on recent publications, we compared the results of the IL-17 response from our clinical and in vitro study to those found in other proinflammatory disease conditions (metabolic conditions, septic shock, viral infections and COVID-19), including symptoms, and dose ranges of effective and safe administration of thiamine. We developed a dose range and pharmacokinetic profile for thiamine as a novel intervention strategy in COVID-19 to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms. Results The DC group showed significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines compared to HV. Three-week of 200 mg daily thiamine treatment significantly lowered the baseline IL-17 levels while increased IL-22 levels (anti-inflammatory response). This was validated by an in vitro macrophage response using a lower thiamine dose equivalent (100 mg), which resulted in attenuation of IL-17 and elevation of IL-22 at the mRNA level compared to the ethanol-only treated group. In humans, a range of 79-474 mg daily of thiamine was estimated to be effective and safe as an intervention for the COVID-19 cytokine storm. A literature review showed that several neurological symptoms of COVID-19 (which exist in 45.5% of the severe cases) occur in other viral infections and neuroinflammatory states that may also respond to thiamine treatment. Discussion The Th17 mediated IL-17 proinflammatory response can potentially be attenuated by thiamine. Thiamine, a very safe drug even at very high doses, could be repurposed for treating the cytokine\/immune storm of COVID-19 and the subsequent neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. Further studies using thiamine as an interventional\/prevention strategy in severe COVID-19 patients could identify its precise anti-inflammatory role.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vatsalya Vatsalya","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Fengyuan Li","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Jane C Frimodig","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Khushboo S Gala","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Shweta Srivastava","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Maiying Kong","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Vijay A Ramchandani","author_inst":"National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism"},{"author_name":"Wenke Feng","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Craig J McClain","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Samuel V Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20176792","rel_title":"Temporal increase in D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East and North Africa: Phylogenetic and mutation analysis study","rel_date":"2020-08-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20176792","rel_abs":"Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among molecular sequences.

Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software. Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S gene mutations included: D614G=435, Q677H=8, and V6F=5. A significant increase in the proportion of D614G was noticed from (63.0%) in February 2020, to (98.5%) in June 2020 (p<0.001). Two large phylogenetic clusters were identified via ML analysis, which showed an evidence of inter-country mixing of sequences, which dated back to February 8, 2020 and March 15, 2020 (median estimates). The mean evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 6.5 x 10-3 substitutions\/site\/year based on large clusters' Bayesian analyses. The D614G mutation appeared to be taking over the COVID-19 infections in the MENA.

The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Methods: A prospective controlled trial was performed on 75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. Results: VWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p=0.24). The ADAMTS13\/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4{+\/-}20.5 vs. 79.7{+\/-}33.2, p<0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13\/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA p=0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p=0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical to TTP. The ADAMTS13\/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality.

To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","rel_num_authors":53,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Katherine J Siddle","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Bennett M.

We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. Methods: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. Results: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations. QTc prolongation events occurred in 2% of patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine with no reported arrhythmia events among those with data available. Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine exposure was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization. Additional exploration of hydroxychloroquine in this mildly symptomatic outpatient population is warranted.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Ip","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jaeil Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Yizhao Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Andre H Goy","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Hansen","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Andrew L Pecora","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brittany A Sinclaire","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Urszula Bednarz","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Marafelias","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shivam Mathura","author_inst":"COTA"},{"author_name":"Ihor S Sawczuk","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph P Underwood III","author_inst":"Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David M Walker","author_inst":"Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Prasad","author_inst":"Bayshore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert L Sweeney","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

The aim of our study is to evaluate diagnostic performances of NS compared to NPA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. We collected 300 paired samples (NS and NPA) from children hospitalized and followed up in our paediatric unit. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of NS referred to NPA of the whole sample and then, considering both the age ([&ge;] and < 6 years old) and the period of collection (March vs follow up) as covariates in different analysis. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to NPA; whereas its specificity results high. In children under 6 years of age, our results suggest to prefer the collection of NS, whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of NS becomes higher if it is performed before NPA.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giada Maria Di Pietro","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Ester Capecchi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Ester Luconi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Lunghi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Samantha Bosis","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Bertolozzi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Cantoni","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health & DSRC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Paola Marchisio","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Victor Leung","author_inst":"Division of Medical Microbiology and Virology, St. Paul's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Prasad","author_inst":"Bayshore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert L Sweeney","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Here, we present the identification of 200 approved drugs, appropriate for repurposing against COVID-19. We constructed a SARS-CoV-2-induced protein (SIP) network, based on disease signatures defined by COVID-19 multi-omic datasets(Bojkova et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020), and cross-examined these pathways against approved drugs. This analysis identified 200 drugs predicted to target SARS-CoV-2-induced pathways, 40 of which are already in COVID-19 clinical trials(Clinicaltrials.gov, 2020) testifying to the validity of the approach. Using artificial neural network analysis we classified these 200 drugs into 9 distinct pathways, within two overarching mechanisms of action (MoAs): viral replication (130) and immune response (70). A subset of drugs implicated in viral replication were tested in cellular assays and two (proguanil and sulfasalazine) were shown to inhibit replication. This unbiased and validated analysis opens new avenues for the rapid repurposing of approved drugs into clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Namshik Han","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Woochang Hwang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kostas Tzelepis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Patrick Schmerer","author_inst":"Justus-Liebig University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Yankova","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Meabh MacMahon","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Winnie Lei","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Katritsis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anika Liu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alison Schuldt","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Harris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Chapman","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Frank McCaughan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Friedemann Weber","author_inst":"Justus-Liebig University"},{"author_name":"Tony Kouzarides","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Therefore, it is prudent to design therapeutics based on the critical binding region of ACE2, which is a [~]30 aa long helix with a kink in the middle. However, the small peptide in solution may lose its helical conformation and subsequently lose its binding potential to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which it utilizes to bind to that helical region. Here we report the design of four stapled peptides based on that helix, which is expected to bind to SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity and prevent the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the infection. All stapled peptides showed high helical contents (50-94% helicity). On the contrary, the linear control peptide NYBSP-C showed no helicity (19%). We have evaluated the peptides in a pseudovirus based single-cycle assay in HT1080 and human lung cells, A549. Three of the four stapled peptides showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080 (IC50: 1.9 - 4.1 {micro}M) and A549 cells (IC50: 2.2 - 2.8 {micro}M). It is noteworthy that the stapled peptide, NYBSP-3, which showed the least helical content, also had the lowest antiviral activity in both cell lines. The linear peptides NYBSP-C and SBP1, reported recently to bind SARS-CoV-2 with KD of [~]47nM affinity, showed no antiviral activity. Most significantly, none of the stapled peptides show any appreciable cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested. We determined the proteolytic stability of one of the most active stapled peptides, NYBSP-4, in human plasma, which showed a half-life (T1\/2) of >289 min.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Curreli","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Sofia M B Victor","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaohe Tong","author_inst":"CPC Scientific, Inc."},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Asim K Debnath","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Meabh MacMahon","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Winnie Lei","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Katritsis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anika Liu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alison Schuldt","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Harris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Chapman","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Frank McCaughan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Friedemann Weber","author_inst":"Justus-Liebig University"},{"author_name":"Tony Kouzarides","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute"},{"author_name":"Marie G Ponce","author_inst":"Jersey Shore University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel LaCapra","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank J Cunningham","author_inst":"JFK Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Arthur G Calise","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Mountainside Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradley L Pulver","author_inst":"Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dominic Ruocco","author_inst":"Palisades Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Greggory E Mojares","author_inst":"Pascack Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Eagan","author_inst":"Raritan Bay Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristy L Ziontz","author_inst":"Riverview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Mastrokyriakos","author_inst":"Southern Ocean Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart L Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Outcomes and Value Research, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Felecia Cerrato","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Maha Farhat","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"John Branda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"David Hooper","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jessie M Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program; Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Travis P.

Effective and widespread vaccination is still uncertain, so many scientific efforts have been directed towards discovering antiviral treatments. Many drugs are being investigated to inhibit the coronavirus main protease, 3CLpro, from cleaving its viral polyprotein, but few publications have addressed this proteases interactions with the host proteome or their probable contribution to virulence. Too few host protein cleavages have been experimentally verified to fully understand 3CLpros global effects on relevant cellular pathways and tissues. Here, we set out to determine this proteases targets and corresponding potential drug targets. Using a neural network trained on coronavirus proteomes with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.983, we predict that a large proportion of the human proteome is vulnerable to 3CLpro, with 4,460 out of approximately 20,000 human proteins containing at least one predicted cleavage site. These cleavages are nonrandomly distributed and are enriched in the epithelium along the respiratory tract, brain, testis, plasma, and immune tissues and depleted in olfactory and gustatory receptors despite the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 patients. Affected cellular pathways include cytoskeleton\/motor\/cell adhesion proteins, nuclear condensation and other epigenetics, host transcription and RNAi, coagulation, pattern recognition receptors, growth factor, lipoproteins, redox, ubiquitination, and apoptosis. This whole proteome cleavage prediction demonstrates the importance of 3CLpro in expected and nontrivial pathways affecting virulence, lead us to propose more than a dozen potential therapeutic targets against coronaviruses, and should therefore be applied to all viral proteases and experimentally verified.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Prescott","author_inst":"N\/A"},{"author_name":"Kerstin Wernike","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Donata Hoffmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas C.
