To investigate whether abnormal fibrinolysis is a culprit or protector or both, we associated elevated plasma D-dimer with clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on studies available in the literature. Methods We performed this systematic review based on both meta-analysis and meta-regression to compute the correlation of D-dimer at admission with clinical features of COVID-19 patients in retrospective studies or case series. We searched the databases until Aug 18, 2020, with no limitations by language. The first hits were screened, data extracted, and analyzed in duplicate. We did the random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions (both univariate and multivariate). D-dimer associated clinical variables and potential mechanisms were schematically reasoned and graphed. Findings Our search identified 42 observational, or retrospective, or case series from six countries (n=14,862 patients) with all races and ages from 1 to 98-year-old. The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 g\/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between relatively mild (or healthy control) and severely affected groups with significant publication bias. Univariate meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels, including 3 demographics, 5 comorbidies, 22 laboratory tests, 18 organ injury biomarkers, 8 severe complications, and 2 outcomes (discharge and death). Of these, 11 readouts were negatively associated with the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors for the identified D-dimer associated variables. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN, bilirubin, ALT, AST, systolic blood pressure, and CK. We thus propose that \"insufficient hyperfibrinolysis (fibrinolysis is accelerated but unable to prevent adverse clinical impact for clinical deterioration COVID-19)\" as a peculiar mechanism. Interpretation The findings of this meta-analysis- and meta-regression-based systematic review supports elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for mortality and severe complications. D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and locally (i.e., in the lung) hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis. D-dimer and associated clinical biomarkers and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong-Long J Ji","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Zhenlei Su","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Xinxiang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Runzhen Zhao","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Andrey A Komissarov","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Guohua Yi","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Shan-Lu Liu","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Steven Idell","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Michael A Matthay","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20190066","rel_title":"Understanding SARSCOV-2 propagation, impacting factors to derive possible scenarios and simulations","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20190066","rel_abs":"We aimed to analyze factors impacting the Covid-19 epidemic on a macro level, comparing multiple countries across the world and verifying the occurrence at a micro level through cluster analysis. The severity of the epidemic was most strongly related to exposure to ultraviolet light and extrapolated levels of vitamin D and to the health of the population, especially with regards to obesity. We found no county with an obesity level < 8% with a severe epidemic. We also found that countries where the population benefited from sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation and spent time outside fared well. Factors related to increased propagation of the virus included the use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), population density, poorly aerated gatherings, relative humidity, timely policies of closing clustering places until aeration was improved, and daily amount of ridership on public transportation, especially subways. Population lockdowns, masks, and blood type did not provide much explanatory power. Contact tracing was not analyzed as very few countries applied it for long enough. The excess mortality observed is within the ranges of severe past influenza epidemics of 2016\/2017 or 1999\/2000 and lower than older severe influenza epidemics of the 1940s or 1970s. We estimated that COVID mortality death counts in European countries is over estimated when taking into account excess mortality further confirming the important role of comorbidities independently of lockdown policy. A few countries observed an under-mortality despite of some deaths counts attributed to COVID-19. Treatments or vaccines should protect the fraction of the population that is not suffering from severe comorbidities. Our study suggested that prevention measures should be directed to improving aeration systems, enhancing diets and exercise, and ensuring adequate levels of vitamin D. Prevention measures and attention should be paid to anxiety resulting from this episode which may be associated with increases in obesity, addictions, vitamin D deficiency, depression, suicide, and hunger ultimately weakening population resiliency.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lewis E.

Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals, like HCW. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study, tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, novel behavioral at-home assessment of smell function with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and RT-qPCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. Among the 17 infected HCW, 53% reported smell loss, and were more likely to report smell loss than COVID-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (P < .01). 67% reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among COVID-positive HCW who reported smell loss (P < .01). Conclusions: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of COVID-19 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian J Weiss","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tuki N Attuquayefio","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth B White","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Fangyong Li","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rachel S Herz","author_inst":"Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Theresa L White","author_inst":"Le Moyne College, SUNY Upstate Medical University"},{"author_name":"Melissa Campbell","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bertie Geng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"M Catherine Muenker","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The Yale IMPACT Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Richard A Martinello","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Dana M Small","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shelli F Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20190389","rel_title":"Passive, open access data measures movement and predicts COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20190389","rel_abs":"Background. In the months following the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions led to widespread implementation of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing contacts and transmission. In the US, state and local governments introduced and enforced the bulk of interventions, including university closures. As universities closed, student departures decreased the total population size of college towns while state-level interventions decreased contacts among remaining residents. Though the pandemic continues without pharmaceutical interventions, businesses have begun to reopen, and many universities have resumed operations. These actions have increased contacts and population sizes in college towns. Monitoring movement to implement adaptive policies will be critical for outbreak management. Methods. We use publicly available remotely-sensed nighttime lights and traffic cameras to measure the impact of restriction policies on movement and activities in the university town of State College, and the surrounding areas of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Results. At the county level, nighttime radiance did not differ significantly across restriction phases and largely reflected seasonal fluctuations seen in previous years. Throughout the county, traffic volumes were lowest during the most severe period of restrictions ('Red phase' in Pennsylvania). As restrictions eased, traffic volumes grew, indicating increased movement within and between population centers. We show that real-time, publicly available traffic data captured behavioral responses and compliance to different restrictions phases. We also demonstrate that these increases in activity levels precede increases in reported COVID-19 cases. Conclusion. Passively collected data can measure population-level movement in response to restrictions and changes in these measured movements are reflected in observed SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Measuring these changes in movements and contacts in near real time can inform local adaptive interventions to curtail outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina L.

We developed a population-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, combined with mortality incidence data in four European countries, to test a range of assumptions about the impact of influenza. We found consistent evidence for a 2-2.5-fold population-level increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with influenza during the period of co-circulation.

Since then, more than 230 000 tests were carried out confirming a total of 1330 cases of COVID-19 in the country as of 20th of August 2020. Rapidly reacting to the spread of the infection, an ongoing sequencing campaign was started mid-March in collaboration with the local testing laboratories, with an ultimate goal in sequencing as much local viral isolates as possible, resulting in first full-length SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome sequences from the Baltics region being made publicly available in early April.

Data were collected from a self-administered questionnaire and a blood sample for antibody identification. The COVIDAR IgG and IgM test were used. RESULTS: 738 health workers were included; the overall response rate was 73.80%. 71.83% of that were women; age showed a normal distribution. Nurses and doctors accounted for more than half of the staff. 75.86% of people claimed to always use Personal Protective Equipment. 5.61% of people had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. 4.60% of people had previously had a nasopharyngeal swab with a negative result. Five workers had positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 (four women and one man) with negative IgM. The mean age of the cases was 35 years old; two of them were asymptomatic; neither of them had a swab sample taken.

Design We interrogated linked electronic health records for patients diagnosed with HPB diseases in East London since 2008 (n=15 586), and identified 212 confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We conducted risk analyses to identify the effect of demographics, comorbidities and associated medication use, and lifestyle factors and with appropriate adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age group and HPB diagnoses on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results We observed an increased risk of COVID-19 for men (Relative Risk, RR=1.59; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.09) and Black ethnicity (RR=2.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.18). Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher risks associated with South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, age>70, and past smokers were due to co-existing comorbidities; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk. Increased mortality risk was observed for Black ethnicity (RR=2.4; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.48), and patients with a pre-existing kidney condition (RR=2.13; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.55) - particularly when accompanied with an acute episode of renal complications (RR=2.74; 95% CI 1.32 to 5.13). Conclusions This large multi-ethnic population-based study of HPB patients shows a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 for male gender, Black ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, and substance mis-users. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a pre-existing kidney disease for further renal insult to prevent fatality.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abu Z M Dayem Ullah","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Lavanya Sivapalan","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Claude Chelala","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Hemant M Kocher","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"ANDREA GAMARNIK","author_inst":"FUNDACION INSTITUTO LELOIR"},{"author_name":"Gaston Vargas","author_inst":"Sanitary Region VIII, Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Marta Priedite","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020). Method: Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing. Results: Overall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and\/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and\/or anxiety. Conclusion: These results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie Li","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Joanne Beames","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jill Newby","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute & School of Psychology, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kate Maston","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Helen Christensen","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aliza Werner-Seidler","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Marta Priedite","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults' intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it. Methods and findings: Multivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n=1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard M.

We model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the city during the pandemic and estimate the effectiveness of public health interventions (overall and for each major intervention separately) for the entire population and by age group. We estimate that the overall effective reproductive number was 2.99 at the beginning of the pandemic wave and reduced to 0.93 one week after the stay-at-home mandate. Most age groups experienced similar reductions in transmission. Interventions reducing contact rates were associated with a 70.7% (95% CI: 65.0 - 76.4%) reduction of transmission overall and >50% for all age groups during the pandemic. Face covering was associated with a 6.6% (95% CI: 0.8 - 12.4%) reduction of transmission overall and up to 20% for 65+ year-olds during the first month of implementation. Accounting for the amount of time masks are in use (i.e. mainly outside homes), these findings indicate universal masking could reduce transmission by up to 28-32% when lockdown-like measures are lifted, if the high effectiveness estimated for older adults were achieved for all ages. These estimates are verified by out-of-fit projections and support the need for implementing multiple interventions simultaneously in order to effectively mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wan Yang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jaimie Shaff","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Kate Maston","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Helen Christensen","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aliza Werner-Seidler","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Marta Priedite","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

We expect that the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). Methods: We conducted three analyses to assess the association between COVID-19 public health restriction measures and loneliness: (1) A comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-2017) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (2) an analysis of the correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness based on cross-sectional survey data from early May 2020, and (3) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes in loneliness (Corona panel data) from late March to early June 2020. Results: We found (1) loneliness levels to have increased in 2020 in comparison with previous years, (2) an association between the number of restriction measures older adults reported to be affected from and loneliness, and (3) that loneliness was higher during shut-down compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. Discussion: Our results provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus we do not expect strong negative consequences for older adults mental health downstream. Nonetheless, effects of longer and\/or repeated future restriction measures aiming at social distancing should be closely monitored.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erwin Stolz","author_inst":"Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Hannes Mayerl","author_inst":"Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Freidl","author_inst":"Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Ruth Moir","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Risk Policy Advice, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK"},{"author_name":"Louise Kelly","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"},{"author_name":"Emma Snary","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiological Sciences, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Marta Priedite","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

This mathematical approach allows us to infer several important aspects concerning the underlying growth dynamics, such as its current stage and its possible evolution in the near future. We also analyze the rank-frequency distribution of preprints servers, ordered by the number of COVID-19 preprints they host, and find that it follows a power-law decay.

The objective of this paper was to determine the initial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) services in Kenya. Methods: Data for the first four months (March-June) of the pandemic and the equivalent period in 2019 were extracted from Kenya Health Information System. Two-sample test of proportions for hospital attendance for select RMNCAH services between the two periods were computed. Results: There were no differences in monthly mean ({+\/-}SD) attendance between March-June 2019 vs 2020 for antenatal care (400,191.2{+\/-}12,700.0 vs 384,697.3{+\/-}20,838.6), hospital births (98,713.0{+\/-}4,117.0 vs 99,634.5{+\/-}3,215.5), family planning attendance (431,930.5{+\/-}19,059.9 vs 448,168.3{+\/-}31,559.8), post-abortion care (3,206.5{+\/-}111.7 vs 448,168.3{+\/-}31,559.8) and pentavalent 1 immunisation (114,701.0{+\/-}3,701.1 vs 110,915.8{+\/-}7,209.4), p>0.05. However, there were increasing trends for adolescent pregnancy rate, significant increases in FP utilization among young people (25.7% to 27.0%), injectable (short-term) FP method uptake (58.2% to 62.3%), caesarean section rate (14.6% to 15.8%), adolescent maternal deaths (6.2% to 10.9%) and fresh stillbirths (0.9% to 1.0%) with a reduction in implants (long-term) uptake (16.5% to 13.0%) (p<0.05). No significant change in maternal mortality ratio between the two periods (96.6 vs 105.8\/100,000 live births, p=0.1023) although the trend was increasing. Conclusion: COVID-19 may have contributed to increased adolescent pregnancy, adolescent maternal death and stillbirth rates in Kenya. If this trend persists, recent gains achieved in maternal and perinatal health in Kenya will be lost. With uncertainty around the duration of the pandemic, strategies to mitigate against catastrophic indirect maternal health outcomes are urgently needed.

We studied blood and airways of COVID-19 patients across disease severity at multiple timepoints. M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. M-MDSCs isolated from COVID-19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} production partly via an arginase-1 (Arg-1) dependent mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3{zeta} chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity. In conclusion, M-MDSCs expand in blood of COVID-19 patients, suppress T cells and strongly associate with disease severity, suggesting a role for M-MDSCs in the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara Falck-Jones","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Sindhu Vangeti","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Meng Yu","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ryan Falck-Jones","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alberto Cagigi","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Isabella Badolati","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Osterberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Julius Lautenbach","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Eric Ahlberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ang Lin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Inga Szurgot","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Klara Lenart","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Fredrika Hellgren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jorgen Salde","author_inst":"Health Care Services Stockholm County (SLSO)"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Niclas Johansson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Max Bell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Lore","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Farnert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Smed-Sorensen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Janis Klovins","author_inst":"Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Ratsupites 1, Riga, Latvia, LV-1067"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20189415","rel_title":"Blood neurofilament light concentration at admittance: a potential prognostic marker in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20189415","rel_abs":"Objective To test the hypotheses that serum concentrations of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) can serve as biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Methods Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. Results In total, 21 % (n=10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, whereas the overall mortality rate was 13 % (n=6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p<0.001) than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p=2.6 x 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p=0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements whereas the concentrations in survivors were stable. Significantly higher concentrations of NfL were found in patients reporting fatigue, while reduced concentrations were found in patients experiencing cough, myalgia and joint pain. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p=0.02). Conclusion Increased concentrations of NfL and GFAp in COVID-19 patients on admission may indicate increased mortality risk. Measurement of blood biomarkers for nervous system injury can be useful to detect and monitor CNS injury in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne Hege Aamodt","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Einar August H\u00f8gest\u00f8l","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Trine Haug Popperud","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Jan Cato Holter","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Microbiology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Anne Margarita Dyrhol-Riise","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Kristian Tonby","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Birgitte Stiksrud","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Else Qvist-Paulsen","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Microbiology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Tone Berge","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University, Department of Mechanichal, Elerctronic and Chemical Engineering, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Andreas Barratt-Due","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Division of Emergencies and Critical Care, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"P\u00e5l Aukrust","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Lars Heggelund","author_inst":"Drammen Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway."},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanne Flinstad Harbo","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Niclas Johansson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Max Bell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Lore","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Farnert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Smed-Sorensen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Janis Klovins","author_inst":"Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Ratsupites 1, Riga, Latvia, LV-1067"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20190074","rel_title":"Clinical Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 by Race","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20190074","rel_abs":"Background: Studies of COVID-19 have shown that African Americans have been affected by the virus at a higher rate compared to other races.

The study included all critically ill hospitalized patients between March 6, 2020 and May 5, 2020. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization included mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and mortality stratified by race. Results Of 288 patients included (mean age, 63 +\/- 16 years; 45% female), 210 (73%) were African American. African Americans had significantly higher rates of comorbidities compared to other races, including hypertension (80% vs 59%, p=0.001), diabetes (49% vs 34%, p=0.026) and mean BMI (33 kg\/m2vs 28 kg\/m2, p<0.001).

Rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide led the WHO declare pandemic within a few month after the first case of infection. Due to the lack of a prophylactic measure to control the virus infection and spread, early diagnosis and quarantining of infected as well as the asymptomatic individuals are necessary for the containment of this pandemic. However, the current methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis are expensive and time consuming although some promising and inexpensive technologies are coming out for emergency use. In this work, we report the synthesis of a cheap yet highly sensitive cobalt-functionalized TiO2 nanotubes (Co-TNTs)-based electrochemical biosensor and its efficacy for rapid detection of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by examining S-RBD protein as the reference material. A simple, low-cost, and one-step electrochemical anodization route was used to synthesize TNTs, followed by an incipient wetting method for cobalt functionalization of the TNTs platform, which is connected to a potentiostat for data collection. This sensor specifically detected the S-RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 even at very low concentration (range of 14 nM to 1400 nM). Additionally, our sensor showed a linear response in the detection of viral protein with concentration range. In summary, our Co-TNT sensor is highly effective in detecting SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein in approximately 30 seconds, which can be explored for developing a point of care diagnostics for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and saliva samples.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhaskar Sravan Vadlamani","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Timsy Uppal","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Subhash C Verma","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manoranjan Misra","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Maria Christina Creel-Bulos","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christine L Kempton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Milad Sharifpour","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Manila Gaddh","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Roman Sniecinski","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Cheryl L Maier","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Fadi Nahab","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Lars Heggelund","author_inst":"Drammen Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway."},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanne Flinstad Harbo","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Niclas Johansson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Max Bell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Lore","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Farnert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Smed-Sorensen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Janis Klovins","author_inst":"Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Ratsupites 1, Riga, Latvia, LV-1067"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20189092","rel_title":"Longitudinal immune profiling of mild and severe COVID-19 reveals innate and adaptive immune dysfunction and provides an early prediction tool for clinical progression","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20189092","rel_abs":"With a rising incidence of COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality worldwide, it is critical to elucidate the innate and adaptive immune responses that drive disease severity. We performed longitudinal immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 patients and healthy donors. We observed a dynamic immune landscape of innate and adaptive immune cells in disease progression and absolute changes of lymphocyte and myeloid cells in severe versus mild cases or healthy controls. Intubation and death were coupled with selected natural killer cell KIR receptor usage and IgM+ B cells and associated with profound CD4 and CD8 T cell exhaustion. Pseudo-temporal reconstruction of the hierarchy of disease progression revealed dynamic time changes in the global population recapitulating individual patients and the development of an eight-marker classifier of disease severity. Estimating the effect of clinical progression on the immune response and early assessment of disease progression risks may allow implementation of tailored therapies.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre F Rendeiro","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Joseph Casano","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Charles Kyriakos Vorkas","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Harjot Singh","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ayana Morales","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert A DeSimone","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Grant B Ellsworth","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Soave","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shashi N Kapadia","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kohta Saito","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Brown","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"JingMei Hsu","author_inst":"Division of Hematology\/Oncology, Department of Medicine Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10065, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Kyriakides","author_inst":"Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven Chui","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Luca Cappelli","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Cacciapuoti","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Wayne Tam","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Galluzzi","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Paul D Simonson","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190496","rel_title":"Systematic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG epitopes at single amino acid resolution","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190496","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG responses play critical roles for patients to recover from COVID-19, in-depth dissecting of the IgG responses on systems level is of great interest.

Understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance to be able to respond to outbreaks and take action against spread of the disease. Transmission within the household is a concern, especially because infection control is difficult to apply within the household domain. Methods We used comprehensive administrative register data from Denmark, comprising the full population and all COVID-19 tests, to estimate household transmission risk and attack rate. Results We studied the testing dynamics for COVID-19 and found that the day after receiving a positive test result within the household, 35% of potential secondary cases were tested and 13% of these were positive. After a primary case in 6,782 households, 82% of potential secondary cases were tested within 14 days, of which 17% tested positive as secondary cases, implying an attack rate of 17%. Among primary cases, those aged 0-24 were underrepresented when compared with the total population. We found an approximately linearly increasing relationship between attack rate and age. We investigated the transmission risk from primary cases by age, and found an increasing risk with age of primary cases for adults, while the risk seems to decrease with age for children. Conclusions Although there is an increasing attack rate and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 with age, children are also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 within the household.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederik Plesner Lyngse","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Carsten Thure Kirkeby","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Tariq Halasa","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Viggo Andreasen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Robert Leo Skov","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Frederik Trier M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Tyra Grove Krause","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"K\u00e5re M\u00f8lbak","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Zi-wen Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Chuang-sheng Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20188961","rel_title":"Effect of Screen time on Glycaemic control of Type 2 Diabetes patients during COVID-19 Outbreak: A Survey based Study","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20188961","rel_abs":"Introduction: Decreased workout during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a serious issue for the patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), since their glycaemic control is very much related to that. COVID-19 has posed a severe health issue that is playing havoc on the aged patients with existing comorbidities. Studies have shown mixed reports of social media on T2DM, with some showing positive results due to increased use of apps and adherence to lifestyle, while others have shown adiposity and glycaemic control related to hours spent on-screen time in children. Data on adult T2DM patients screen time activity and prevailing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and, post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) is sparse. Aim: To study the effect of screen-time spent on social media per day on glycaemic parameters of T2DM patients. Materials and methods: Data was collected for T2DM patients giving informed written consent and meeting a set of pre-specified inclusion criteria. Through two rounds of surveys done from May 15 to June 26, the authors collected the answers to a set of questionnaires from a total of 344 patients sent via email. Due to the non-availability of data from a few patients, a total of 229 patients data were finally analyzed. SPSS software version V21 was used to perform Binary logistic regression for calculating the odds ratio (OR) of the categorical variables. The outcomes, looked for in the analysis, were poor control of glycaemic parameters like HbA1c (defined by >7%), FBS (defined by >150 mg\/dL) and, PPBS (defined by >200 mg\/dL) and the exposure variables were Screen time spent by the person per day for all the three glycaemic parameters and, doctors visit and, daily exercise for HbA1c outcome. Results: A total of 173 patients had a screen time (henceforth, it means time spent on social media) of less than 2 hours\/day in the study sample. Among the 173 patients, 73 (42.2%) had achieved HbA1c less than 7%, whereas the remaining 100 (57.8%) had HbA1c more than 7%. On the other hand, 56 patients had a screen time of more than 2 hours, of which 44 (72.73%) had HbA1c more than 7%. Among the 173 patients, only 89 (51.44%) had an FBS value of more than 150 mg\/dL as compared to 46 (82.12%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. Out of these 173 patients, only 43 (24.86%) had a PPBS value of more than 200 mg\/dL as compared to 41 (73.21%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. It was found that the odds of having a poor glycaemic control as per HbA1c, FBS and PPBS is 2.67 times higher (95%CI: 1.91-6.95), 4.34 times higher (95%CI: 1.52-4.76) and, 8.26 times higher (95%CI: 4.26-11.83) in the cohort with a screen time of more than 2 hours as compared to the cohort with a screen time of less than 2 hours, respectively. Conclusion: There seems to be an increased risk of uncontrolled glycaemic indices with increased screen time and, decreased work out. This is a small study and the findings need to be corroborated with larger sample size.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sayak Roy","author_inst":"Medica Superspeciality Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kingshuk Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Medwes Pvt LTD, Kolkata, Wb, India"},{"author_name":"Tariq Halasa","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Viggo Andreasen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Robert Leo Skov","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Frederik Trier M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Tyra Grove Krause","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"K\u00e5re M\u00f8lbak","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Zi-wen Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Chuang-sheng Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190421","rel_title":"Massachusetts General Hospital Covid-19 Registry reveals two distinct populations of hospitalized patients by race and ethnicity","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190421","rel_abs":"Objective: To evaluate differences by race\/ethnicity in clinical characteristics and outcomes among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Methods: The MGH Covid-19 Registry includes confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized at MGH and is based on manual chart reviews and data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs). We evaluated differences between White\/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N=866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020 - May 4, 2020. Results: Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black\/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White\/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)]. Hispanic patients were symptomatic longer before presenting to care (median 5 vs 3d, p=0.039) but were more likely to be sent home with self-quarantine than be admitted to hospital (29% vs 16%, p<0.001). Hispanic patients had fewer comorbidities yet comparable rates of ICU or death (34% vs 36%). Nonetheless, a greater proportion of Hispanic patients recovered by 14 days after presentation (62% vs 45%, p<0.001; OR = 1.99, p = 0.011 in multivariable adjusted model) and fewer died (2% versus 18%, p<0.001). Conclusions: Hospitalized Hispanic patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities compared to White\/non-Hispanic patients; despite comparable rates of ICU care or death, a greater proportion recovered. These results have implications for public health policy and the design and conduct of clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ingrid V Bassett","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Virgina A Triant","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bridget A Bunda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caitlin A Selvaggi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Shinnick","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Frances Lu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bianca C Porneala","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tingyi Cao","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven A Lubitz","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"James B Meigs","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Hsu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea S Foulkes","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.289892","rel_title":"Initial insights into the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala suggest local spread from limited introductions","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.289892","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread from a city in China to almost every country in the world, affecting millions of individuals. Genomic approaches have been extensively used to understand the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 across the world. Kerala is a unique state in India well connected with the rest of the world through a large number of expatriates, trade, and tourism. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported in Kerala in January 2020, during the initial days of the pandemic. The rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases in the state of Kerala has necessitated the understanding of the genetic epidemiology of circulating virus, evolution, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2. We sequenced a total of 200 samples from patients at a tertiary hospital in Kerala using COVIDSeq protocol at a mean coverage of 7,755X. The analysis identified 166 unique high-quality variants encompassing 4 novel variants and 89 new variants identified for the first time in SARS-CoV-2 samples isolated from India. Phylogenetic and haplotype analysis revealed that the circulating population of the virus was dominated (94.6% of genomes) by three distinct introductions followed by local spread, apart from identifying polytomies suggesting recent outbreaks. The genomes formed a monophyletic distribution exclusively mapping to the A2a clade. Further analysis of the functional variants revealed two variants in the S gene of the virus reportedly associated with increased infectivity and 5 variants that mapped to five primer\/probe binding sites that could potentially compromise the efficacy of RT-PCR detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive report of genetic epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chandni Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Medical College PO, Kozhikode Kerala, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Mohit Kumar Divakar","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Jain","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Prasanth Viswanathan","author_inst":"Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Medical College PO, Kozhikode Kerala, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Rahul C.

Here, we identified host cell membrane protein candidates that were present in proximity to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins through the use of proximity labeling and proteomics analysis. The identified proteins represent candidate key factors that may be required for viral entry. Our results indicated that a number of membrane proteins, including DPP4, Cadherin-17, and CD133, were identified to co-localize with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2 cells that were used to expand the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine\/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.\n\nAuthor summaryIncreased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 particularly in minority groups.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Holcomb","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Aikaterini Alexaki","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Nancy Hernandez","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Kyle Laurie","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Jacob Kames","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Nobuko Hamasaki-Katagiri","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Anton A.

Research to identify effective therapies for COVID19 includes: i) designing a vaccine as future protection; ii) structure-based drug design; and iii) identifying existing drugs to repurpose them as effective and immediate treatments. To assist in drug repurposing and design, we determined two apo structures of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 main protease at ambienttemperature by Serial Femtosecond X-ray crystallography. We employed detailed molecular simulations of selected known main protease inhibitors with the structures and compared binding modes and energies. The combined structural biology and molecular modeling studies not only reveal the dynamics of small molecules targeting main protease but will also provide invaluable opportunities for drug repurposing and structure-based drug design studies against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRadiation-damage-free high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 main protease SFX structures obtained at near-physiological-temperature offer invaluable information for immediate drug-repurposing studies for the treatment of COVID19.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Serdar Durdagi","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Cagdas Dag","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Berna Dogan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Merve Yigin","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Timucin Avsar","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Cengizhan Buyukdag","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ismail Erol","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fatma Betul Ertem","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Seyma Calis","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Gunseli Yildirim","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Muge Orhan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Omur Guven","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Busecan Aksoydan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ebru Destan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Kader Sahin","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Sabri Ozkan Besler","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Lalehan Oktay","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Shafiei","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ilayda Tolu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Esra Ayan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Busra Yuksel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ayse Buket Peksen","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oktay Gocenler","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.
