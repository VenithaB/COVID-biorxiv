Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2.Methods To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, lung, and kidney of rats through immunohistochemistry.Results Strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the nasal respiratory epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, alveoli, kidney, and taste buds of the tongue. Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was much stronger in the peripheral alveoli than in the central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, respiratory dysfunction, and acute nephropathy.Conclusions A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Differential distribution of TMPRSS2 in the lung indicated the COVID-19 symptoms to possibly be exacerbated by TMPRSS2 expression. This study might provide potential clues for further investigation of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Level of Evidence NACompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rumi Ueha","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Taku Sato","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Takao Goto","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Akihito Yamauchi","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Kenji Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Yamasoba","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.097501","rel_title":"Traffic-derived particulate matter and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression in human airway epithelial cells","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.097501","rel_abs":"Background The mechanism for the association between traffic-derived particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) and cases of COVID-19 disease reported in epidemiological studies is unknown. To infect cells, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host airway cells. Increased ACE2 expression in lower airway cells in active smokers, suggests a potential mechanism whereby PM10 increases vulnerability to COVID-19 disease.Objective To assess the effect of traffic-derived PM10 on human airway epithelial cell ACE2 expression in vitro.Methods PM10 was collected from Marylebone Road (London) using a kerbside impactor. A549 and human primary nasal epithelial cells were cultured with PM10 for 2 h, and ACE2 expression (median fluorescent intensity; MFI) assessed by flow cytometry. We included cigarette smoke extract as a putative positive control. Data were analysed by either Mann-Whitney test, or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test.Results PM10 at 10 \u03bcg\/mL, and 20 \u03bcg\/mL increased ACE2 expression in A549 cells (P&lt;0.05, 0.01 vs. medium control, respectively). Experiments using a single PM10 concentration (10 \u03bcg\/mL), found increased ACE2 expression in both A549 cells (control vs. PM10, median (IQR) MFI; 470 (0.1 to 1114) vs 6217 (5071 to 8506), P&lt;0.01), and in human primary epithelial cells (0 (0 to 591) vs. 4000 (2610 to 7853), P&lt;0.05).

As of May 2020, Turkey is among the top ten countries with the most cases. A comprehensive genomic characterization of the virus isolates in Turkey is yet to be carried out. Here, we built a phylogenetic tree with globally obtained 15,277 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes. We identified the subtypes based on the phylogenetic clustering in comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the first thirty SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and sequenced in Turkey. We suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is earlier than the first reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are dispersed among most types in the phylogenetic tree. We find two of the seventeen sub-clusters enriched with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the country. Finally, we traced virus genomes based on their phylogenetic placements. This analysis suggested multiple independent international introductions of the virus and revealed a hub for the inland transmission. We released a web application to track the global and interprovincial virus spread of the isolates from Turkey in comparison to thousands of genomes worldwide.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ogun Adebali","author_inst":"Sabanci University"},{"author_name":"Aylin Bircan","author_inst":"Sabanci University"},{"author_name":"Defne Circi","author_inst":"Sabanci University"},{"author_name":"Burak Islek","author_inst":"Sabanci University"},{"author_name":"Zeynep Kilinc","author_inst":"Sabanci University"},{"author_name":"Berkay Selcuk","author_inst":"Sabanci University"},{"author_name":"Berk Turhan","author_inst":"Sabanci University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.095224","rel_title":"Two mutations P\/L and Y\/C in SARS-CoV-2 helicase domain exist together and influence helicase RNA binding","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.095224","rel_abs":"RNA helicases play pivotal role in RNA replication by catalysing the unwinding of complex RNA duplex structures into single strands in ATP\/NTP dependent manner.

In this study we identified a novel mutation at position 541of the helicase where the tyrosine (Y) got substituted with cytosine (C). We found that Y541C is a destabilizing mutation increasing the molecular flexibility and leading to decreased affinity of helicase binding with RNA. Earlier we had reported a mutation P504L in the helicase protein for which had not performed RNA binding study. Here we report that P504L mutation leads to increased affinity of helicase RNA interaction. So, both these mutations have opposite effects on RNA binding.

MAb362 binds to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and competitively blocks hACE2 receptor binding, by completely overlapping the hACE2 structural binding epitope. Furthermore, MAb362 IgA neutralizes both pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in human epithelial cells expressing hACE2.

In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay limit of detection was comparable to central laboratory reverse-transcription quantitative PCR tests with observed SARS-CoV-2 detection below 100 copies\/mL. The Xpert(R) Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies\/mL were diluted into six sample pools. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted by population public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care test site and should be determined by assessing positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael G.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a recent zoonotic infection that has quickly reached pandemic proportions2,3. Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses is thought to occur in the absence of pre-existing immunity in the target human population. Using diverse assays for detection of antibodies reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, we demonstrate the presence of pre-existing humoral immunity in uninfected and unexposed humans to the new coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies were readily detectable by a sensitive flow cytometry-based method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals and were particularly prevalent in children and adolescents. These were predominantly of the IgG class and targeted the S2 subunit. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, targeting both the S1 and S2 subunits, as well as concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies, lasting throughout the observation period of 6 weeks since symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera also variably reacted with SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleoprotein (N), but not with the S1 subunit or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S on standard enzyme immunoassays. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera exhibited specific neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes, according to levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera. Distinguishing pre-existing and de novo antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for our understanding of susceptibility to and the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin W Ng","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Faulkner","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Georgina Cornish","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Annachiara Rosa","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ruth Harvey","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Saira Hussain","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Rachel Ulferts","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Earl","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Antoni Wrobel","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Donald Benton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Chloe Roustan","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"William Bolland","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Rachael Thompson","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ana Agua-Doce","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Philip Hobson","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Judith Heaney","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rickman","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Stavroula Paraskevopoulou","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Catherine F Houlihan","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust;

The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19.\n\nMethodsWe performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status.\n\nResultsACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in both, epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related with age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Urszula Radzikowska","author_inst":"Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, University of Zurich and Christine-Kuhne - Center for Research and Education, Davos, Switzerland;

However, as for any virus, SARS-CoV-2 is subject to constant selection pressure, with new Mpro mutations arising over time. Identification and structural characterization of Mpro variants is thus critical for robust inhibitor design. Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventy-nine Mpro variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas J Cross","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Gemma R Takahashi","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Diessner","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Marquise G Crosby","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Vesta Farahmand","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Shannon Zhuang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Carter Tribley Butts","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rachel W Martin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Hideaki Morita","author_inst":"Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, University of Zurich, Davos, Switzerland;

Specialized chemosensory epithelial cells that express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5) are found throughout the airways and intestinal epithelium and are involved in responses to viral infection.\n\nResultsHerein we performed deep transcriptional profiling of olfactory epithelial cells sorted by flow cytometry based on the expression of fluorescent protein markers for olfactory sensory neurons and TRPM5 in the mouse (Mus musculus). We find profuse expression of transcripts involved in inflammation, immunity and viral infection in TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells and olfactory sensory neurons. These cells express the Tmprss2 transcript that encodes for a serine protease that primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein before entry into host cells. Intranasal infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) elicited a decrease in olfactory sensory neurons.\n\nConclusionOur study provides new insights into a potential role for TRPM5-expressing cells in viral infection of the olfactory epithelium. We find that, as found for solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) and brush cells in the airway epithelium, and for tuft cells in the intestine, the transcriptome of TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells and olfactory sensory neurons indicates that they are likely involved in the inflammatory response elicited by viral infection of the olfactory epithelium.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric D Larson","author_inst":"University of Colorado"},{"author_name":"Paul Feinstein","author_inst":"Hunter College, CUNY"},{"author_name":"Arianna Gentile Polese","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Andrew N Bubak","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Christy S Niemeyer","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Merle","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Douglas Shepherd","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Vijay R Ramakrishnan","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Maria A Nagel","author_inst":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Diego Restrepo","author_inst":"Universtiy of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Matthias Reiger","author_inst":"Chair and Institute of Environmental Medicine, UNIKA-T, Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Augsburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Avidan U Neumann","author_inst":"Chair and Institute of Environmental Medicine, UNIKA-T, Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Augsburg, Germany;

Critical to their development is a deeper understanding of cross-neutralizing antibody responses induced by natural human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. Here, we mined the memory B cell repertoire of a convalescent SARS donor and identified 200 SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies that target multiple conserved sites on the spike (S) protein. A large proportion of the antibodies display high levels of somatic hypermutation and cross-react with circulating HCoVs, suggesting recall of pre-existing memory B cells (MBCs) elicited by prior HCoV infections. Several antibodies potently cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the bat SARS-like virus WIV1 by blocking receptor attachment and inducing S1 shedding. These antibodies represent promising candidates for therapeutic intervention and reveal a new target for the rational design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Z Wec","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wrapp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Herbert","author_inst":"U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Frederick, MD 21702, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel P Maurer","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mrunal Sakharkar","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Rohit K Jangra","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"M.

We characterized the mRNA copy number, glycosylation status, transduction efficiency, and innate immune property of the new vaccine platform. Importantly, we showed the ShaCoVacc induced strong spike-specific humoral immune responses and potent neutralizing activities by a single injection. Additionally, we disclosed the epitopes of spike-specific antibodies using peptide microarray and revealed epitopes susceptible to specific neutralizing antibodies. These results support further development of ShaCoVacc as a candidate vaccine for COVID-19 and VSP may serve as a new vaccine platform for emerging infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yujia Cai","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Di Yin","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sikai Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaolong Tian","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Zhijue Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hewei Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyuan Wang","author_inst":"BD Gene Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yi Shi","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Lindai Da","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Quanjun Wang","author_inst":"Academy of Military Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianjiang Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tianlei Ying","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxu Hong","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Michael Brown","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Shu Lin","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Melanie Sinclair","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Carl Johnson","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Sarat Pudi","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert Bortz III","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ariel S Wirchnianski","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ethan Laudermilch","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Catalina Florez","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"J.

Here, we report that mice immunized with RBD219-N1\/Alhydrogel\u00ae were fully protected from lethal SARS-CoV challenge (0% mortality), compared to \u223c 30% mortality in mice when immunized with the SARS S protein formulated with Alhydrogel\u00ae, and 100% mortality in negative controls. An RBD219-N1 formulation Alhydrogel\u00ae was also superior to the S protein, unadjuvanted RBD, and AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant)-formulated RBD in inducing specific antibodies and preventing cellular infiltrates in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. Specifically, a formulation with a 1:25 ratio of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel\u00ae provided high neutralizing antibody titers, 100% protection with non-detectable viral loads with minimal or no eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. As a result, this vaccine formulation is under consideration for further development against SARS-CoV and potentially other emerging and re-emerging beta-CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wen-Hsiang Chen","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinrong Tao","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Anurodh Agrawal","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Algaissi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Bi-Hung Peng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jeroen Pollet","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Strych","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Bottazzi","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter J Hotez","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sara Lustigman","author_inst":"Lindsley F Kimball Research Institute, New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Lanying Du","author_inst":"Lindsley F Kimball Research Institute, New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Lindsley F Kimball Research Institute, New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te K Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Quanjun Wang","author_inst":"Academy of Military Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianjiang Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tianlei Ying","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxu Hong","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Michael Brown","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Shu Lin","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Melanie Sinclair","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Carl Johnson","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Sarat Pudi","author_inst":"Adimab LLC, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert Bortz III","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ariel S Wirchnianski","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ethan Laudermilch","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Catalina Florez","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"J.

The small ~30kb single-stranded RNA genome of Coronaviruses makes them adept at cross species spread and drift, increasing their probability to cause pandemics. However, this small genome also allows for a robust understanding of all proteins coded by the virus. We employed protein modeling, molecular dynamic simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome and dynamicome understanding of SARS-CoV-2. The Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD) has been established (prokoplab.com\/vistedd), opening future discoveries and educational usage. In this paper, we highlight VIStEDD usage for nsp6, Nucleocapsid (N), and Spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N we reveal highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we have developed a quantitative dynamics cross correlation matrix insight into interaction with the ACE2\/SLC6A19 dimer complex. From this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from population genomic databases within ACE2\/SLC6A19\/TMPRSS2, warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Moreover, these variants have ultralow frequency, but can exist as hemizygous in males for ACE2, which falls on the X-chromosome. Two noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) found in ~9% of African descent individuals for ACE2 may regulate expression and be related to increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. This powerful database of SARS-CoV-2 can aid in research progress in the ongoing pandemic.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruchir Gupta","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Charron","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Stenger","author_inst":"University of North Alabama"},{"author_name":"Jared Painter","author_inst":"University of North Alabama"},{"author_name":"Hunter Steward","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Taylor Cook","author_inst":"Grand Rapids Community College"},{"author_name":"William Faber","author_inst":"Grand Rapids Community College"},{"author_name":"Austin Frisch","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Eric Lind","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Bauss","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Xiaopeng Li","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Olivia Sirpilla","author_inst":"Walsh University"},{"author_name":"Xavier Soehnlen","author_inst":"Walsh University"},{"author_name":"Adam Underwood","author_inst":"Walsh University"},{"author_name":"David Hinds","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Michele Morris","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Neil Lamb","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Joseph Carcillo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Caleb Bupp","author_inst":"Spectrum Health"},{"author_name":"Bruce Uhal","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Spectrum Health"},{"author_name":"Jeremy W Prokop","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Robert Bortz III","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ariel S Wirchnianski","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ethan Laudermilch","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Catalina Florez","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"J.

In response, many diagnostic manufacturers have developed molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. This study compared three of these assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima) and the BioFire Diagnostics COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance, as well as workflow. All three assays showed a similar limit of detection (LOD) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection ranging from 500-1,000 genome equivalents\/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same trend, but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies\/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7% when compared to the consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had Ct values >37 on the Fusion assay.\n\nIn conclusion, while all three assays showed similar relative LODs, we showed differences in absolute LODs depending on which standard was employed. In addition, the Fusion and BioFire assays showed better clinical performance, while the Aptima assay showed a modest decrease in overall PPA. These findings should be kept in mind when making platform testing decisions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Smith","author_inst":"Northwell Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhen","author_inst":"Northwell Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Ryhana Manji","author_inst":"Northwell Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Deborah Schron","author_inst":"Northwell Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Scott Duong","author_inst":"Northwell Health Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Berry","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"William Faber","author_inst":"Grand Rapids Community College"},{"author_name":"Austin Frisch","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Eric Lind","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Bauss","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Xiaopeng Li","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Olivia Sirpilla","author_inst":"Walsh University"},{"author_name":"Xavier Soehnlen","author_inst":"Walsh University"},{"author_name":"Adam Underwood","author_inst":"Walsh University"},{"author_name":"David Hinds","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Michele Morris","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Neil Lamb","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Joseph Carcillo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Caleb Bupp","author_inst":"Spectrum Health"},{"author_name":"Bruce Uhal","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Surender Rajasekaran","author_inst":"Spectrum Health"},{"author_name":"Jeremy W Prokop","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Robert Bortz III","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ariel S Wirchnianski","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ethan Laudermilch","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Catalina Florez","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"J.

However, recent observations raised concerns about potential post-viral severe inflammatory reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We describe an outbreak of cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) admitted between April 27 and May 7, 2020, in the general paediatrics department of a university hospital in Paris, France. All children prospectively underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing, and echocardiography. The number of admissions for KD during the study period was compared to that observed since January 1, 2018, based on discharge codes, using Poisson regression. Results: A total of 17 children were admitted for KD over an 11-day period, in contrast with a mean of 1.0 case per 2-week period over 2018-2019 (Poisson incidence rate ratio: 13.2 [95% confidence interval: 7.3-24.1], p <0.001). Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years, and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. Eleven patients presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. Fourteen patients (82%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7\/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14\/16). All patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5\/17). The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 cases (29%) during hospitalisation.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the association of pre-existing conditions with COVID-19 mortality. Methods We searched MEDLINE, OVID databases, SCOPUS, and medrxiv.org for the period December 1, 2019, to May 1, 2020. The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing conditions. Comorbidities explored were cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and stroke. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified. Results Ten chronic conditions from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 61,455 patients with COVID-19; mean age, 61 years; 57% male). Overall the between-study study heterogeneity was medium and studies had low publication bias and high quality. Coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer significantly increased the risk of mortality from COVID-19. The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease was 2.4 times as high as those without coronary heart disease (RR= 2.40, 95%CI=1.71-3.37, n=5) and twice as high in patients with hypertension as high as that compared to those without hypertension (RR=1.89, 95%CI= 1.58-2.27, n=9). Patients with cancer also were at twice the risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to those without cancer (RR=1.93 95%CI 1.15-3.24, n=4), and those with congestive heart failure were at 2.5 times the risk of mortality compared to those without congestive heart failure (RR=2.66, 95%CI 1.58-4.48, n=3). Conclusions COVID-19 patients with all any cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer have an increased risk of mortality. Tailored infection prevention and treatment strategies targeting this high-risk population are warranted to optimize survival.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paddy Ssentongo","author_inst":"Penn State University"},{"author_name":"Anna E.

We aimed to examine the utility of rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections and to inform infection control measures. Methods We set up rapid viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from PCR-positive diagnostic samples using nanopore sequencing, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 hours. We established a rapid review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19. Results Between 13 March and 24 April 2020 we collected clinical data and samples from 5191 COVID-19 patients in the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples, producing 747 complete viral genomes. We conducted combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of 299 patients at our hospital and identified 26 genomic clusters involving 114 patients. 66 cases (57.9%) had a strong epidemiological link and 15 cases (13.2%) had a plausible epidemiological link. These results were fed back clinical, infection control and hospital management teams, resulting in infection control interventions and informing patient safety reporting. Conclusions We established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and demonstrated the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection control interventions to reduce further healthcare-associated infections.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke W Meredith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"William L Hamilton","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ben Warne","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Charlotte J Houldcroft","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Myra Hosmillo","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Aminu Jahun","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Caller","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Caddy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Fahad A Khokhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant R Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sally N Forret","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael p Weekes","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

We aimed to describe the excess mortality (EM) due to COVID-19 in the three most affected Italian regions, by estimating EM in subgroups defined by gender and age classes within each municipality from February 23 to March 31, 2020. EM varied widely among municipalities even within the same region; it was similar between genders for the [&ge;]75 age group, while in the other age groups it was higher in males.

The main objective is to unveil the evolution of the number of real infected people, and consequently to predict the peak of the epidemic and subsequent evolution. For this purpose, an original nonlinear model relating the raw data with the time-varying geometric ratio of infected people is elaborated, and a Kalman Filter is used to estimate the involved state variables. A hypothetical simulated case is used to show the adequacy and limitations of the proposed method. Then, several countries, including China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, UK and the USA, are tested to illustrate its behavior when real-life data are processed. The results obtained clearly show the beneficial effect of the social distancing measures adopted worldwide, confirming that the Covid-19 epidemic peak is left behind in those countries where the outbreak started earlier, and anticipating when the peak will take place in the remaining countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez-Exposito","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Jose A.

With its high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that in Mexico there is a high risk of fatal complications from COVID-19. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalisation and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods and Findings. We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SS). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.47 SD 15.62, were analysed. Men were about 1.54 times as likely to be hospitalized than women (p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and >=74 years were more likely to be hospitalized than people from 25-49 years (OR 2.05, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 23.84, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalised than people without these morbidities (p<0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR=1.53, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and [&ge;]75 years were more likely to die than people from 25-49 years (OR 1.96, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination, provided a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR=2.10; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalisation, intubation and pneumonia conferred a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR=2.57; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). The main limitation of our study is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19. Conclusions. The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population develops two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, high mortality is a sever outcome for those infected by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Fernanda Carrillo-Vega","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Geriatria"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Salinas-Escudero","author_inst":"Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez"},{"author_name":"Carmen Garcia-Pe\u00f1a","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Geriatria"},{"author_name":"Luis Miguel Gutierrez-Robledo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Geriatria"},{"author_name":"Lorena Parra-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Geriatria"},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Fantini","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Caller","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Caddy","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Fahad A Khokhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant R Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sally N Forret","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael p Weekes","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

The aim of this study is to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19, deciphering the carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We studied the carbohydrate-binding receptors that could be important for viral entry and for immune-modulatory responses, and we studied the interactions of the spike protein with the host lung microbiota. Exploring solid-phase immunoassays, we evaluated the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of 12 different human carbohydrate-binding proteins (C-type lectins and Siglecs) involved in binding, triggering and modulation of innate and adaptive immune-responses. We revealed a specific binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the receptors DC-SIGN, MGL, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10 that are all expressed on myeloid immune cells. In addition, because the lung microbiota can promote or modulate viral infection, we studied the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides, as well as other bacterial glyco-conjugates. We show specific binding of the spike protein to different S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides (serotypes 19F and 23F but not to serotype 14). Moreover we demonstrated a specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the lipopolysaccharide from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the leading cause of acute nosocomial infections and pneumonia. Interestingly, we identified rhamnosylated epitopes as one of the discriminating structures in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In conclusion, we revealed novel ACE2-independent carbohydrate-mediated interactions with immune modulating lectins expressed on myeloid cells, as well as host lung microbiota glyco-conjugates. Our results identified new molecular pathways using host lectins and signalling, that may contribute to viral infection and subsequent immune exacerbation. Moreover we identified specific rhamnosylated epitopes in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2, providing a hypothetical link between the presence of specific lung microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrizio Chiodo","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Sven C.M Bruijns","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Ernesto Rodriguez","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"R.J.

The rapid development of therapies is of major importance. However, our lack of understanding of the molecular processes and host cell signaling events underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection hinder therapy development. We employed a SARS-CoV-2 infection system in permissible human cells to study signaling changes by phospho-proteomics. We identified viral protein phosphorylation and defined phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways were activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathway targetable by approved drugs. Inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five compounds prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant. This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It provides with novel strategies for COVID-19 treatment.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Klann","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Georg Tascher","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), External partner site Fra"},{"author_name":"Christian Muench","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Cardio"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Flaviana Di Lorenzo","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Garcia-Rivera","author_inst":"Finlay Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Yury Valdes-Balbin","author_inst":"Finlay Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Vicente Verez-Bencomo","author_inst":"Finlay Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Yvette van Kooyk","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant R Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sally N Forret","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael p Weekes","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

Tests must include fail-safe controls that affirmatively report the presence of intact RNA and demonstrate success of all steps of the assay. A result of \"no virus signal\" is insufficient for clinical interpretation: controls must also say \"The reaction worked as intended and would have found virus if present.\" Unfortunately, a widely used test specified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incorporates a control that does not perform as intended and claimed. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 with this assay requires both intact RNA and successful reverse transcription. The CDC-specified control does not require either of these, due to its inability to differentiate human genomic DNA from reverse-transcribed RNA. Patient DNA is copurified from nasopharyngeal swabs during clinically-approved RNA extraction and is sufficient to return an \"extraction control success\" signal using the CDC design. As such, this assay fails-unsafe: truly positive patient samples return a false-negative result of \"no virus detected, control succeeded\" following any of several readily-encountered mishaps. This problem affects tens-of-millions of patients worth of shipped assays, but many of these flawed reagents have not yet been used. There is an opportunity to improve this important diagnostic tool. As demonstrated here, a re-designed transcript-specific control correctly monitors sample collection, extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR detection. This approach can be rapidly implemented and will help reduce truly positive patients from being incorrectly given the all-clear.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA widely-used COVID-19 diagnostic is mis-designed and generates false-negative results, dangerously confusing \"No\" with \"Dont know\" - but its fixable","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam P Rosebrock","author_inst":"Stony Brook Medicine"},{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Georg Tascher","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), External partner site Fra"},{"author_name":"Christian Muench","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Cardio"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Flaviana Di Lorenzo","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Garcia-Rivera","author_inst":"Finlay Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Yury Valdes-Balbin","author_inst":"Finlay Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Vicente Verez-Bencomo","author_inst":"Finlay Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Yvette van Kooyk","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Anna Yakovleva","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Grant R Hall","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Theresa Feltwell","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sally N Forret","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael p Weekes","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from eight large phage-displayed Fab, scFv and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. One high affinity mAb, IgG1 ab1, specifically neutralized replication competent SARS-CoV-2 with exceptional potency as measured by two different assays. There was no enhancement of pseudovirus infection in cells expressing Fc{gamma} receptors at any concentration. It competed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding to RBD suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. IgG1 ab1 potently neutralized mouse ACE2 adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild type BALB\/c mice and native virus in hACE2 expressing transgenic mice. The ab1 sequence has relatively low number of somatic mutations indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 days) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Drelich","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"Universitty of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Chuan Chen","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Zehua Sun","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Sch\u00e4fer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Xianglei Liu","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Doncho V Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Liyong Zhang","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eric L Peterson","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"Alex Conard","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"John W Mellors","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Dimiter S Dimitrov","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

Comparison of expression profiles of lung cell lines A549 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 (with ACE2 expression)) or Influenza A virus (IAV)) and Calu3 (infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV) revealed upregulation of the antiviral interferon signaling in all three viral infections. However, perturbations in inflammatory, mitochondrial, and autophagy processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Validation of findings from cell line data revealed perturbations in autophagy and mitochondrial processes in the infected human nasopharyngeal samples. Specifically, downregulation of mTOR expression, mitochondrial ribosomal, mitochondrial complex I, and lysosome acidification genes were concurrently observed in both infected cell lines and human datasets. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection impedes autophagic flux by upregulating GSK3B in lung cell lines, or by downregulating autophagy genes, SNAP29 and lysosome acidification genes in human samples, contributing to increased viral replication. Therefore, drugs targeting lysosome acidification or autophagic flux could be tested as intervention strategies. Additionally, downregulation of MTFP1 (in cell lines) or SOCS6 (in human samples) results in hyperfused mitochondria and impede proper interferon response. Coexpression networks analysis identifies correlated clusters of genes annotated to inflammation and mitochondrial processes that are misregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Finally, comparison of age stratified human gene expression data revealed impaired upregulation of chemokines, interferon stimulated and tripartite motif genes that are critical for antiviral signaling. Together, this analysis has revealed specific aspects of autophagic and mitochondrial function that are uniquely perturbed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Komudi Singh","author_inst":"National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Yun-Ching Chen","author_inst":"National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer T.

Our objective in this study was to investigate the dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of betacoronavirus ({beta}CoV) among African bats. We retrieved sequence data from established databases such as GenBank and Virus Pathogen Resource, covering the partial RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of Bat coronaviruses from eight African, three Asian, five European, two South American countries and Australia. We analyzed for Phylogeographic information relating to genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics. Our study revealed that majority of the African strains fell within Norbecovirus subgenera, with an Evolutionary rate of 1.301 x 10-3, HPD (1.064 x 10-3 - 1.434 x 10-3) subs\/site\/year. The African strains diversified into three main subgenera, Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and Marbecovirus. The time to most common recent ancestor for Norbecovirus strains was 1968, and 2010, for the African Marbecovirus strains. There was evidence of inter species transmission of Norbecovirus among bats in Cameroun and DRC. Phlylogeography showed that there were inter-continental spread of Bt-CoV from Europe, China and Hong Kong into Central and Southern Africa, highlighting the possibility of long distance transmission. Our study has elucidated the possible evolutionary origins of {beta}CoV among African bats, we therefore advocate for broader studies of whole genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Babatunde Olanrewaju Motayo","author_inst":"Federal Medical Center, Abeokuta"},{"author_name":"Olukune Oluwapamilerin Oluwasemowo","author_inst":"Dept of Virology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Paul Akiniyi Akinduti","author_inst":"Covenant University"},{"author_name":"Fayaz Seifuddin","author_inst":"National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Ilker Tunc","author_inst":"National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Pirooznia","author_inst":"National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Sch\u00e4fer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Xianglei Liu","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Doncho V Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Liyong Zhang","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eric L Peterson","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"Alex Conard","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"John W Mellors","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Dimiter S Dimitrov","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

We identified top ACE2 interactors, including miRNAs which are shared regulators between the ACE2, virus-infection related proteins and heart interaction networks, using lung and nervous system networks as a reference. We also identified main SARS-CoV-2 risk groups and performed drug predictions for them.\n\nResultsWe found the same range of ACE2 expression confidence in respiratory and cardiovascular systems (averaging 4.48 and 4.64, respectively). Analysing the complete ACE2 interaction network, we identified 11 genes (ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, CCL2, TFRC, MEP1A, ADAM17, FABP2, NPC1, CLEC4M, TMPRSS2) associated with virus-infection related processes. Previously described genes associated with cardiovascular risk factors DPP4, CCL2 and ANPEP were extensively connected with top regulators of ACE2 network, including ACE, INS and KNG1. Enrichment analysis revealed several disease phenotypes associated with interaction networks of ACE2, heart tissue, and virus-infection related protein, with the strongest associations with the following diseases (in decreasing rank order): obesity, hypertensive disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. We described for the first time microRNAs-miR (miR-302c-5p, miR-1305, miR-587, miR-26b-5p, and mir-27a-3p), which were common regulators of the three networks: ACE2, heart tissue and virus-infection related proteins.\n\nConclusionOur study provides novel information regarding the complexity of signaling pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2 and proposes predictive tools as miR towards personalized diagnosis and therapy in COVID-19. Additionally, our study provides a list of miRNAs with biomarker potential in prediction of adverse outcome in patients with COVID-19 and CVD.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=106 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/094714v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e52b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c6d9ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57be3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8889c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zofia Wicik","author_inst":"Centro de Matematica, Computacao e Cognicao, Universidade Federal do ABC, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Unive"},{"author_name":"Ceren Eyileten","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Warsaw, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology CEPT, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Jakubik","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Warsaw, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology CEPT, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Pavao","author_inst":"Centro de Matematica, Computacao e Cognicao, Universidade Federal do ABC, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jolanta M Siller-Matula","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Warsaw, CEPT, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Cardio"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Warsaw, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology CEPT, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Sch\u00e4fer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Xianglei Liu","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Doncho V Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Liyong Zhang","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eric L Peterson","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"Alex Conard","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"John W Mellors","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Dimiter S Dimitrov","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.

Early data suggest that the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 appear to be higher among patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in cardiomyocytes, there has been no conclusive evidence of direct viral infection although the presence of inflammation and viral genome within the hearts of COVID-19 patients have been reported. Here we transduced A549 lung epithelial cells with lentivirus overexpressing selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2. We then isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence of viral RNA within the purified EVs. Importantly, we observed that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were able to actively uptake these EVs and viral genes were subsequently detected in the cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, uptake of EVs containing viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing EVs represent an indirect route of viral RNA entry into cardiomyocytes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youjeong Kwon","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sarath Babu Nukala","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Shubhi Srivastava","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Hiroe Miyamoto","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nur Izzah Ismail","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong SAR"},{"author_name":"Jalees Rehman","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sang-Bing Ong","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong SAR"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Lee","author_inst":"University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix"},{"author_name":"Sang-Ging Ong","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Doncho V Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Liyong Zhang","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eric L Peterson","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"Alex Conard","author_inst":"Abound Bio"},{"author_name":"John W Mellors","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Chien-Te Tseng","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Dimiter S Dimitrov","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elinor Moore","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theodore Gouliouris","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Popay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Iain Roddick","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mark Reacher","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sharon Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"M.
