Given a consequential liver function, and the high risk of death coming from liver disorders, the assessment of Novel Coronavirus Disease on liver function is importance. Hence, we carried out this meta-analysis to heightening insight into the occult features of COVID 19, which is likely to affect liver function. Method:This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers, which reported available findings on the association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection. We used the STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Result:In this present meta-analysis, 52 papers, including 8,463 COVID-19 patients, were studied. The prevalence of increased liver enzymes among the patients, including Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, were 30% and 21% in non-severe patients, respectively, which were 38% and 48% in severe patients. The prevalence of increasing C-reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and Bilirubin were 55%, 39%, 28%, and 10% in non-severe patients respectively, which were 78%, 75%, 79% and 17% in sever patients.The prevalence of liver toxicity as a complication of COVID-19 was 20%.Also patients who have severe condition are 5.54, 4.22, 4.96, 4.13 and 4.34 times more likely to have elevated CRP, ALT, AST, LDH, D-dimer enzymes retrospectively. Conclusion:Elevation of some liver markers were higher in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. All to gather, we assumed that abnormal liver markers could act as a prognostic factor for a better survey of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Zahedi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Yousefi","author_inst":"Semnan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Abounoori","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Malekan","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Tajik","author_inst":"Azad University of Tehran"},{"author_name":"Keyvan Heydari","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Parham Mortazavi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Monireh Ghazaeian","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fateme Sheydaee","author_inst":"Semnan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirreza Nasirzadeh","author_inst":"Gonabad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.111294","rel_title":"Preprinting a pandemic: the role of preprints in the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.111294","rel_abs":"The world continues to face an ongoing viral pandemic that presents a serious threat to human health. The virus underlying the COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2, caused over 29 million confirmed cases and 925,000 deaths since January 2020. Although the last pandemic occurred only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a paradigm shift in the interim. The scientific community responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 16,000 COVID-19 scientific articles within 4 months of the first confirmed case, of which 6,753 were hosted by preprint servers. Focussing on bioRxiv and medRxiv, two growing preprint servers for biomedical research, we investigated the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates and characteristics of sharing across online platforms. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science, and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific communication landscape.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Fraser","author_inst":"ZBW - Leibniz Information Centre for Economics"},{"author_name":"Liam Brierley","author_inst":"Department of Health Data Science, University of Liverpool, Brownlow Street, Liverpool, L69 3GL, UK"},{"author_name":"Gautam Dey","author_inst":"Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Meyerhofstr. 1, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jessica K Polka","author_inst":"ASAPbio, 3739 Balboa St # 1038, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA"},{"author_name":"Mate Palfy","author_inst":"The Company of Biologists, Bidder Building, Station Road, Histon, Cambridge CB24 9LF, UK"},{"author_name":"Federico Nanni","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathon Alexis Coates","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, Charterhouse Square Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry Queen Mary University of London, London, EC1M 6BQ, "},{"author_name":"Monireh Ghazaeian","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fateme Sheydaee","author_inst":"Semnan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirreza Nasirzadeh","author_inst":"Gonabad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"scientific communication and education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104661","rel_title":"Identifying Explosive Cases with Unsupervised Machine Learning","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104661","rel_abs":"An analysis of a combined dataset of Wave 1 and 2 cases, aligned at approximately Local Time Zero + 2 months with unsupervised machine learning methods such as PCA and deep autoencoder dimensionality reduction allows to clearly separate milder background cases from those with more rapid and aggressive onset of the epidemics.

Although efficacy have not been proven, lopinavir\/ritonavir 400 mg\/100 mg twice daily has been proposed as a treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19. Previously published cohorts showed Covid-19 is associated with major inflammation. To date, no data are available regarding lopinavir\/ritonavir plasma concentration and its safety in Covid-19 patients. Methods: Real-world Covid-19 experience based on a retrospective cohort study Results: On the cohort of 31 patients treated by lopinavir\/ritonavir for Covid-19, we observed very high lopinavir plasma concentrations, increased of 4.6-fold (IQR 2.9-6.4), with regards to average plasma concentrations in HIV treatment. All except two patients were above the upper limit of the concentration ranges of HIV treatment. In this cohort, about one over four to five patients prematurely stopped lopinavir\/ritonavir therapy due to a moderate adverse drug reaction, mainly hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusion: Patients with Covid-19 pneumonitis treated with lopinavir\/ritonavir have plasma concentrations dramatically higher than expected. Owing to that high plasma concentration may be required for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, it appears that lopinavir dosage should not be reduced in the absence of adverse effect. About 80% of the patients well tolerated lopinavir\/ritonavir therapy under these plasma concentrations. However, cautious is necessary as drug repurposing can be associated with a new drug safety profile.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laurent Chouchana","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sana Boujaafar","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Ines Gana","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Laure-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Preta","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Lucile Regard","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Paul Legendre","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Celia Azoulay","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Canou\u00ef","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Zerbit","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104794","rel_title":"Epidemiology of sleep disorders during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic scoping review protocol","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104794","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impacting human health globally.

In this systematic scoping review, we aim to assess the current evidence on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature on sleep disorders. Methods: We will search seven major health databases and additional sources to identify, evaluate, and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available interventions addressing the same. We will use the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review and report the findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Conclusion: This review will identify the epidemiological burden of and interventions for sleep disorders. The findings of this review will be widely communicated with the research and professional community to facilitate future research and practice.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samia Tasnim","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, TX 77843, USA."},{"author_name":"Mariya Rahman","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, TX 77843, USA."},{"author_name":"Priyanka Pawar","author_inst":"Mamta Foundation, India."},{"author_name":"Liye Zou","author_inst":"School of Psychology, Shenzhen University, China."},{"author_name":"Abida Sultana","author_inst":"Nature Study Society of Bangladesh, Khulna, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"E.

To examine the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in the sample and the relation between PCR and antibody test results. design: cross-sectional and (retrospective) cohort study setting: a nursing home for the elderly Bessemerberg in Lanaken (Belgium) with up to 130 beds. Lanaken is situated in the Belgian province with the highest COVID-19 prevalence. participants: residents (N=108) and staff members (N=93) of the nursing home outcomes: PCR, IgM and IgG results: the prevalence of COVID-19, based on PCR test was 34% (N=40) for residents and 13% (N=11) for staff members, respectively. Of the residents, 13% showed positive IgM results and 15% positive IgG results. In 17% of the residents, at least one of the antibodies was positive. In total 13% of the staff members had positive IgM and 16% had a positive IgG. In 20% of the staff members at least one of these antibody tests was positive. In PCR positive residents, the percentage of IgM positive, IgG positive, and at least one of both was 28%, 34%, and 41%. In PCR positive staff, we found 30%, 60%, and 60%. Additional antibody tests were performed in nine residents between day 11 and 14 after the positive PCR test. Of those, 7 (78%) tested positive on at least one antibody. When retesting three weeks later, all remaining residents also tested positive. conclusions: Recently it was reported that in Belgium antibodies are present in 3-4% of the general population. Although, the prevalence in our residents is higher, the number is largely insufficient for herd immunity. In staff members of the regional hospital the prevalence of antibodies was 6%. The higher prevalence in nursing home staff (21%) may be related to the complete absence of good quality protection in the first weeks of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank Buntinx","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Peter Claes","author_inst":"Woonzorgcentrum Bessemerberg, Lanaken, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Marjo Gulikers","author_inst":"Woonzorgcentrum Bessemerberg, Lanaken, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Jan Y Verbakel","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jan De Lepeleire","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Michael Van der Elst","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marc Van Ranst","author_inst":"University of Leuven, Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology (Rega Institute), Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pieter Vermeersch","author_inst":"Department of cardiovascular Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Zerbit","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20104703","rel_title":"COVID-19 in China: Risk Factors and R0 Revisited","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20104703","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 epidemic had spread rapidly through China and subsequently has proliferated globally leading to a pandemic situation around the globe. Human-to-human transmissions, as well as asymptomatic transmissions of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 3rd, public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 is potentially under control. We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020 (excluding Wuhan from our analysis due to missing data). Understanding the characteristics of spatiotemporal clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. The prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. We performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R0 among different regions for prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic (different age group percentage compared to the total population) factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions will help prioritize segments of a given community\/ region for action and provide a visual aid in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region. Furthermore, revised estimation and our methodology will aid in improving the human health consequences of COVID-19 elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irtesam Mahmud Khan","author_inst":"BUET"},{"author_name":"Wenyi Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Sumaira Zafar","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Wang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Junyu He","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hailon Sun","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ubydul Haque","author_inst":"University of North Texas Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"M.

This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socio-economic factors largely depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement lockdowns. In this phase the further spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified. Methods We analyze the geographical distribution of known cases per capita across 401 local districts in Germany, once for infections in the initial phase and for new infections during the second phase. Results In Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the second phase, richer districts and districts with a higher share of university-educated employees record fewer new infections, whilst the initial safety advantage of more socially deprived districts disappears. Conclusion The social stratification of Covid-19 changes substantively across the two phases of the pandemic in Germany. Only in the second phase does socio-economic advantage turn into a safety advantage. Thus, suggestions that the pandemic predominantly hits the poor needs to be qualified.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Pluemper","author_inst":"Vienna University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Eric Neumayer","author_inst":"London School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Sumaira Zafar","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Wang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Junyu He","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hailon Sun","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ubydul Haque","author_inst":"University of North Texas Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"M.

This is done by using six commonly available metrics that are monitored daily across the state describing the pandemic impact: number of new cases, percent positive tests, deaths, occupied hospital beds, occupied intensive care beds and utilized ventilators, all directly related to confirmed COVID-19 patients. Nebraska is separated into six Health Care Coalitions based on geography, public health and medical care systems. The PRAM aggregates the data for each of these geographic regions based on disease prevalence acceleration and health care resource utilization acceleration, producing real time analysis of the acceleration of change for each metric individually and also combined into a single weighted index, the PRAM Recovery Index. These indices are then shared daily with the state leadership, coalition leaders and public health directors and also tracked over time, aiding in real time regional and statewide decisions of resource allocation and the extent of use of comprehensive non-pharmacologic interventions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey P Gold","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher Wichman","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Bayles","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ali S Khan","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher Kratochvil","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James V Lawler","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Martin Lowe","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shelly Schwedhelm","author_inst":"Nebraska Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brandon Grimm","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20097444","rel_title":"Diagnostic power of chest CT for COVID-19: to screen or not to screen","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20097444","rel_abs":"Background: chest CT is increasingly used for COVID-19 screening in healthcare systems with limited SARS-CoV-2 PCR capacity. Its diagnostic value was supported by studies with methodological concerns and its use is controversial. Here we investigated its potential to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic patients and to screen asymptomatic patients in a prospective study with minimal selection bias. Methods: From March 19, 2020 to April 20, 2020 we performed parallel SARS-CoV-2 PCR and CT with categorization of COVID-19 suspicion by CO-RADS, in 859 patients with COVID-19 symptoms and 1138 controls admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 unrelated medical urgencies. CT-CORADS was categorized on a 5-point scale from 1 (very low suspicion) to 5 (very high suspicion). AUC under ROC curve were calculated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients to predict positive SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and likelihood ratios for each CO-RADS score were used for rational selection of diagnostic thresholds. Findings: CT-CORADS had significant (P<0.0001) diagnostic power in both symptomatic (AUC=0.891) and asymptomatic (AUC=0.700) patients hospitalized during SARS-CoV-2 peak prevalence. In symptomatic patients (41.7% PCR+), CO-RADS [&ge;] 3 detected positive PCR with high sensitivity (89.1%) and 72.5% specificity. In asymptomatic patients (5.3% PCR+), a CO-RADS score [&ge;] 3 detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with low sensitivity (45.0%) but high specificity (88.8%). Interpretation: CT-CORADS has meaningful diagnostic power in symptomatic patients, supporting its application for time-sensitive triage. Sensitivity in asymptomatic patients is insufficient to justify its use as screening approach.

Besides prone positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option to improve oxygenation. Patients and Method. A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg\/kg\/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 control COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2. Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78) years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1 (135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used : 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p = 0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over 10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same time, the controls did not change PaO2. In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning. This pharmacological intervention may offer an alternative and\/or an additional effect to proning and might delay or avoid more demanding modalities such as ECMO.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MARIE REINE LOSSER","author_inst":"CHRU NANCY"},{"author_name":"COLINE LAPOIX","author_inst":"CHRU NANCY"},{"author_name":"BENOIT CHAMPIGNEULLE","author_inst":"CHU Grenoble Alpes"},{"author_name":"MATTHIEU DELANNOY","author_inst":"CHRU NANCY"},{"author_name":"JEAN FRANCOIS PAYEN","author_inst":"CHU Grenoble Alpes"},{"author_name":"DIDIER PAYEN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY PARIS 7"},{"author_name":"Birgit Heremans","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Ruben Vandenbulcke","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Stefaan Gryspeerdt","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital, Department of Radiology"},{"author_name":"Geert Antoine Martens","author_inst":"AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kern\u00e9is","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rui Batista","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Treluyer","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Sihem Benaboud","author_inst":"AP-HP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20106112","rel_title":"Going by the Numbers : Learning and Modeling COVID-19 Disease Dynamics","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20106112","rel_abs":"The COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has resulted in a challenging number of infections and deaths worldwide. In order to combat the pandemic, several countries worldwide enforced mitigation measures in the forms of lockdowns, social distancing and disinfection measures. In an effort to understand the dynamics of this disease, we propose a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based model. We train our model on nearly four months of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our model can be adjusted based on the parameters in order to provide predictions as needed. We provide results at both the country and county levels. We also perform a quantitative comparison of mitigation measures in various counties in the United States based on the rate of difference of a short and long window parameter of the proposed LSTM model. The analyses provided by our model can provide valuable insights based on the trends in the rate of infections and deaths. This can also be of help for countries and counties deciding on mitigation and reopening strategies. We believe that the results obtained from the proposed method will contribute to societal benefits for a current global concern.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sayantani Basu","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Roy H.

URT specimens that tested negative by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR displayed higher GUSB RT-PCR cycle thresholds (CT) (P=0.070) than those testing positive (median, 30.7; range, 27.0-40.0, and median 29.7; range 25.5-36.8, respectively), this reflecting poorer cellularity. Receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis indicated that a CT threshold of 31.2 discriminated best between positive and negative SARS CoV-2 RT-PCRs (area under a curve, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P=0.08). This cut-off yielded a true negative ratio of 89% and accuracy of 70%.

Currently, severe and non-severe COVID-19 types are differentiated by only a few clinical features, which do not comprehensively characterize complicated pathological, physiological, and immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 invasion in different types. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe and 148 in severe type, from Wuhan, China. The patients' comorbidity and symptoms (26 features), and blood biochemistry (26 features) upon admission were acquired as two input modalities. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that these features differed substantially between two clinical types. Machine learning random forest (RF) models using features in each modality were developed and validated to classify COVID-19 clinical types. Using comorbidity\/symptom and biochemistry as input independently, RF models achieved >90% and >95% predictive accuracy, respectively. Input features' importance based on Gini impurity were further evaluated and top five features from each modality were identified (age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gender, diabetes; D-Dimer, hsTNI, neutrophil, IL-6, and LDH). Combining top 10 multimodal features, RF model achieved >99% predictive accuracy. These findings shed light on how the human body reacts to SARS-CoV-2 invasion as a unity and provide insights on effectively evaluating COVID-19 patient's severity and developing treatment plans accordingly. We suggest that symptoms and comorbidities can be used as an initial screening tool for triaging, while biochemistry and features combined are applied when accuracy is the priority.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuanfang Chen","author_inst":"Institute of HIV\/AIDS\/STI Prevention and Control, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Liu Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng Bao","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, USA"},{"author_name":"Qian Li","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University, Kunshan 215300, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Han","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Hengdong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Xu","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Disease Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Yaorong Ge","author_inst":"Department of Software and Information Systems, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA"},{"author_name":"Shi Chen","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28262, USA"},{"author_name":"Arantxa valdivia","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Clnico Universitario, INCLIVA Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

Though children are at comparatively lower risk compared to adults, the Indian population has a large young demographic that is likely to be at higher risk due to exposure to pollution, malnutrition and poor access to medical care. We aimed to quantify the potential impact of COVID-19 on Indias child population. Methods: We combined district family household survey data with data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China to analyze the potential impact of COVID-19 on children under the age of 5, under three different scenarios; each of which assumed the prevalence of infection to be 0.5%, 1%, or 5%. Results: We find that in the lowest prevalence scenario, across the most populous 18 Indian states, asymptomatic, non-hospitalized symptomatic and hospitalized symptomatic cases could reach 87,200, 412,900 and 31,900, respectively. In a moderate prevalence scenario, these figures reach 174,500, 825,800, and 63,800, and in the worst case, high prevalence scenario these cases could climb as high as 872,200, 4,128,900 and 319,700.

By fitting the infection rate, SEIRD model placed the infection peak on 04\/24\/2020 and could reproduce it to a large extent on the expense of recovery and death rates. Fitting the SEIRD model to death rates gives rather satisfactory predictions with a maximum of infections on 04\/06\/2020.

We propose a non-parametric model to fit the number of daily deaths in a region, which hypothesizes that the death incidence curve will have a convex shape in the beginning, a concave shape near the peak, and a convex shape in the final stage of the death incidence curve after the peak. Using this, we performed robust short-term predictions on phases in five countries worldwide and five US states.

Returning travelers from the U.S. contributed dramatically more to viral spread relative to their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimated that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around ~2.0-2.6, dropping by two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. A comparison between reported and model-estimated case numbers indicated high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 1-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections.

Prior studies in other respiratory infections suggest that convalescent plasma transfusion may offer benefit to some patients. Here, the outcomes of thirty-nine hospitalized patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion were compared against a cohort of retrospectively matched controls. Methods Plasma recipients were selected based on supplemental oxygen needs at the time of enrollment and the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Recipients were transfused with convalescent plasma from donors with a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) anti-spike antibody titer of [&ge;]1:320 dilution. Matched control patients were retrospectively identified within the electronic health record database. Supplemental oxygen requirements and survival were compared between plasma recipients and controls. Results Convalescent plasma recipients were more likely than control patients to remain the same or have improvements in their supplemental oxygen requirements by post-transfusion day 14, with an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75~0.98; p=0.028). Plasma recipients also demonstrated improved survival, compared to control patients (log-rank test: p=0.039). In a covariates-adjusted Cox model, convalescent plasma transfusion improved survival for non-intubated patients (hazard ratio 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05 ~0.72); p=0.015), but not for intubated patients (1.24 (0.33~4.67); p=0.752). Conclusions Convalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean T.

Dynamics of risk states and death from COVID-19 patients defined by the six-point disease severity recommended by the WHO R&D and the time to discharge from hospital were used to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care. Results: Stratified by the risk state at enrollment, low-risk patients exhibited the highest efficacy of remdesivir in reducing subsequent progression to high-risk state by 67% (relative risk (RR)=0.33,95% CI: 0.30-0.35) and further to death by 55% (RR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.39-0.50).

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID19 transmission and case fatality worldwide. Methods We assessed SARS CoV2 virus transmission and COVID19 related fatalities in 50 countries in all continents of the globe. Data from the COVID19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize the incidence data. Disease spread, was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries. R0 package of R statistical software was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the exponential growth method. After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted by taking the R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and population density as an independent variable. Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID19. The proportion of deaths to the total numbers of cases was meta analyzed using metaphor package of R statistical software using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio. Results We found no statistically significant association between disease spread and latitude or population density. The regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID19 cases. The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. An increase in the elderly population proportion by 1 percent was associated with an increase in CFR by 0.32. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age. Conclusion This analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities. Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID19 are associated with age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high risk groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tewodros B Endailalu","author_inst":"Clinton Health Access Initiative"},{"author_name":"Fitsum W Hadgu","author_inst":"Clinton Health Access Initiative"},{"author_name":"Chen-Yang Hsu","author_inst":"Dachung Hospital, Miaoli, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Chao-Chih Lai","author_inst":"Emergency Department of Taipei City Hospital, Ren-Ai Branch, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Amy Ming-Fang Yen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Sam Li-Sheng Chen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Hsiu-Hsi Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Pranai Tandon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adel Bassily-Marcus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Bander","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Charles Sanky","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Amy Dupper","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allen Zheng","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena R.

From a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the spike (S) glycoprotein isolated from the B cells of infected subjects, we identified several mAbs that exhibited potent neutralizing activity with IC50 values as low as 0.9 or 15 ng\/mL in pseudovirus or wild-type (wt) SARS-CoV-2 neutralization tests, respectively. The most potent mAbs fully block the receptor-binding domain of S (SRBD) from interacting with human ACE2. Competition-binding, structural, and functional studies allowed clustering of the mAbs into defined classes recognizing distinct epitopes within major antigenic sites on the SRBD. Electron microscopy studies revealed that these mAbs recognize distinct conformational states of trimeric S protein. Potent neutralizing mAbs recognizing unique sites, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, bound simultaneously to S and synergistically neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. In two murine models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of either COV2-2916 or COV2-2130 alone or a combination of both mAbs protected mice from severe weight loss and reduced viral burden and inflammation in the lung. These results identify protective epitopes on the SRBD and provide a structure-based framework for rational vaccine design and the selection of robust immunotherapeutic cocktails.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seth J Zost","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Pavlo Gilchuk","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph X Reidy","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Trivette","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel S Nargi","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel E Sutton","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Naveen Suryadevara","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Williamson","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elaine C Chen","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Taylor Jones","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Day","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luke Myers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ahmed O Hassan","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Natasha M Kafai","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Emma S Winkler","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James J Steinhardt","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Kuishu Ren","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Yueh-Ming Loo","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.109546","rel_title":"A high-throughput neutralizing antibody assay for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine evaluation","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.109546","rel_abs":"Virus neutralization remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy.

Tools are needed to enhance existing immune profiling capabilities in affected patients. Here we aimed to develop an approach to support the design of focused blood transcriptome panels for profiling the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We designed a pool of candidates based on a pre-existing and well-characterized repertoire of blood transcriptional modules. Available Covid-19 blood transcriptome data was also used to guide this process. Further selection steps relied on expert curation. Additionally, we developed several custom web applications to support the evaluation of candidates. As a proof of principle, we designed three targeted blood transcript panels, each with a different translational connotation: therapeutic development relevance, SARS biology relevance and immunological relevance. Altogether the work presented here may contribute to the future expansion of immune profiling capabilities via targeted profiling of blood transcript abundance in Covid-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Darawan Rinchai","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Basirudeen Kabeer","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Toufiq","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Zohreh Calderone","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Sara Deola","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Tobias Brummaier","author_inst":"Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Mae Sot, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Garand","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Branco","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Nicole Baldwin","author_inst":"Baylor Institute for Immunology Research and Baylor Research Institute, Dallas, Texas, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alfaki","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Matthew Altman","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, University of Washington and Systems Immunology, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Alberto Ballestrero","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Genova and IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa IT"},{"author_name":"Matteo Bassetti","author_inst":"Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy, and Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Ital"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Zoppoli","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Genova and IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa IT"},{"author_name":"Andrea De Maria","author_inst":"Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy, and Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Ital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tang","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"Davide Bedognetti","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Damien Chaussabel","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James J Steinhardt","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Kuishu Ren","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Yueh-Ming Loo","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"}]}
