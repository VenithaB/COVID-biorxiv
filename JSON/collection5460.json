Towards that end, we investigated the option to employ technology in order to assist the diagnosis of patients infected by the virus. As such, several state-of-the-art pre-trained convolutional neural networks were evaluated as of their ability to detect infected patients from chest X-Ray images. A dataset was created as a mix of publicly available X-ray images from patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease, common bacterial pneumonia and healthy individuals. To mitigate the small number of samples, we employed transfer learning, which transfers knowledge extracted by pre-trained models to the model to be trained. The experimental results demonstrate that the classification performance can reach an accuracy of 95% for the best two models.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonios Makris","author_inst":"Harokopio University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Kontopoulos","author_inst":"Harokopio University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Tserpes","author_inst":"Harokopio University of Athens"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110486","rel_title":"Outcomes from COVID-19 across the range of frailty: excess mortality in fitter older people","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110486","rel_abs":"Purpose Our aim was to quantify the mortality from COVID-19 and identify any interactions with frailty and other demographic factors.

Results In 217 COVID-19 cases and 160 controls, older age and South Asian ethnicity, though not socioeconomic position, were associated with higher mortality. For frailty, differences in effect size were evident between cases (HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.93-1.12) and controls (HR 1.99, 95%CI 1.46-2.72), with an interaction term (HR 0.51, 95%CI 0.37-0.71) in multivariable models.

The response to a pandemic requires both resilience and imagination. It has been clearly documented that obtaining an accurate estimate and trends of the actual infection rate and mortality risk are very important for policy makers and medical professionals. One cannot estimate mortality rates without an accurate assessment of the number of infected individuals in the population. This need is also aligned with identifying the infected individuals so they can be properly treated, monitored and tracked. However, accurate estimation of the infection rate, locally, geographically and nationally is important independently. These infection rate estimates can guide policy makers at both state, national or world level to achieve a better management of risk to society. The decisions facing policy makers are very different during early stages of an emerging epidemic where the infection rate is low, middle stages where the rate is rapidly climbing, and later stages where the epidemic curve has flattened to a low and relatively sustainable rate. In this paper we provide relatively efficient pooling methods to both estimate infection rates and identify infected individuals for populations with low infection rates. These estimates may provide significant cost reductions for testing in rural communities, third world countries and other situations where the cost of testing is expensive or testing is not widely available. As we prepare for the second wave of the pandemic this line of work may provide new solutions for both the biomedical community and policy makers at all levels.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Beigel","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Simon Kasif","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Mcloughlin","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Imran Mannan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Arshad Rather","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul Knopp","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Davis","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110502","rel_title":"Conditions for a second wave of COVID-19 due to interactions between disease dynamics and social processes","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110502","rel_abs":"In May 2020, many jurisdictions around the world began lifting physical distancing restrictions against the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), giving rise to concerns about a possible second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These restrictions were imposed as a collective population response to the presence of COVID-19 in communities. However, lifting restrictions is also a population response to their socio-economic impacts, and is expected to increase COVID-19 cases, in turn. This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies a coupled behaviour-disease system. Here we develop a minimal mathematical model of the interaction between social support for school and workplace closure and the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We find that a second wave of COVID-19 occurs across a broad range of plausible model input parameters, on account of instabilities generated by behaviour-disease interactions. We conclude that second waves of COVID-19--should they materialize--can be interpreted as the outcomes of nonlinear interactions between disease dynamics and population behaviour.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sansao A Pedro","author_inst":"Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Departamento de Matematica e Informatica, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Frank T Ndjomatchoua","author_inst":"International Rice Research Institute, Sustainable Impact Platform, Geospatial Science and Modelling cluster, DAPO Box 7777-1301, Metro Manila, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Peter Jentsch","author_inst":"University of Guelph, School of Environmental Sciences, Guelph, N1G 2W1, Canada and University of Waterloo, Department of Applied Mathematics, Waterloo, N2L 3G1"},{"author_name":"Jean M Tcheunche","author_inst":"Avenir Health, Glastonbury, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Madhur Anand","author_inst":"University of Guelph, School of Environmental Sciences, Guelph, N1G 2W1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Chris T Bauch","author_inst":"University of Waterloo, Department of Applied Mathematics, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Daniel Davis","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110551","rel_title":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are associated with reduced viral load","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110551","rel_abs":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been described, but correlation with virologic outcomes is limited.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haoyang Sun","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Borame Lee Dickens","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Alex Richard Cook","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Hannah Eleanor Clapham","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Anu Chaudhary","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Wener","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chihiro Morishima","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110791","rel_title":"Ethnics and economics in COVID-19: Meta-regression of data from countries in the New York metropolitan area","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110791","rel_abs":"Ethnics and economics may affect prevalence and case fatality of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To determine whether COVID-19 prevalence and fatality are modulated by ethnics and economics, meta-regression of data from the countries in the New York metropolitan area were herein conducted. We selected 31 countries in the New York metropolitan area. 1) Prevalence and case-fatality rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 20, 2020 and 2) income and poverty estimates were obtained in each country. We performed random-effects meta-regression using OpenMetaAnalys. The covariates included 1) black (%), 2) Hispanic or Latino (%), 3) poverty rates (%), and 4) median household income ($). Statistically significant (P < .05) covariates in the univariable model were together entered into the multivariable model. A slope (coefficient) of the univariable meta-regression line for COVID-19 prevalence was not significant for household income (P = .639), whereas the coefficient was significantly positive for black (coefficient, 0.021; P = .015), Hispanic\/Latino (0.033; P < .001), and poverty (0.039; P = .02), which indicated that COVID-19 prevalence increased significantly as black, Hispanic\/Latino, and poverty increased. The multivariable model revealed that the slope was significantly positive for only Hispanic\/Latino (P < .001). The coefficient in the univariable model for COVID-19 fatality, however, was not significant for all the covariate. In conclusion, black, Hispanic\/Latino, and poverty (not household income), especially Hispanic\/Latino independently, may be associated with COVID-19 prevalence. There may be no association of black, Hispanic\/Latino, poverty, and household income with COVID-19 fatality.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hisato Takagi","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Toshiki Kuno","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yujiro Yokoyama","author_inst":"Easton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiroki Ueyama","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Takuya Matsushiro","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yosuke Hari","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Keith Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110882","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 lethality decreased over time in two Italian Provinces","rel_date":"2020-05-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110882","rel_abs":"Background Some experts recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 lethality decreased considerably, but no evidence is yet available.

We want to assess the role of targeted synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts\/bDMARDs) and other variables in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD. Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted (1stMar to 15thApr 2020). All patients from the rheumatology outpatient clinic from a hospital in Madrid with a medical diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19. Independent variable: ts\/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD diagnosis, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Incidence rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19, was expressed per 1,000 patients-month. Cox multivariate regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts\/bDMARDs and other covariates on IR. Results: 3,591 IRD patients were included (5,896 patients-month). Concerning csDMARDs, methotrexate was the most used followed by antimalarials. 802 patients were on ts\/bDMARDs, mainly anti-TNF agents, and rituximab. Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54 patients (1.36%) with an IR of 9.15 [95%CI: 7-11.9]. In the multivariate analysis, older, male gender, presence of comorbidities and specific systemic autoimmune conditions (Sjoegren, polychondritis, Raynaud and mixed connective tissue disease) had more risk of hospital admissions regardless other factors. Exposition to ts\/bDMARDs did not achieve statistical signification. Use of glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and csDMARDs dropped from the final model.

We aimed to develop and validate a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both qualified laboratories and point-of-care settings. Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 and close contacts between Jan 26 and April 8, 2020, were recruited from two hospitals. Respiratory samples were collected and tested with LAMP and the results were compared with those obtained by RT-qPCR. The inconsistent samples between these two methods were subjected to next-generation sequencing for confirmation. In addition, we tested the RT-LAMP on an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and patients with other respiratory viral infections. Results We finally collected a cohort of 129 cases (329 nasopharyngeal swabs) and the independent cohort of 76 patients (152 nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples). RT-LAMP was validated to be accurate (overall sensitivity and specificity: 88.89% and 99.00%; positive and negative predictive values: 94.74% and 97.78%) and diagnostically useful (positive and negative likelihood ratios: 88.89 and 0.11). RT-LAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92) compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature heating and visual inspection. The median time required for RT-LAMP was less than 1 h from sample to result. Further analyses indicated that RT-LAMP was feasible for asymptomatic patients and did not cross-react with other respiratory pathogen infections. Conclusion The RT-LAMP assay offers a rapid, sensitive and straightforward detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing in the public domain and hospitals.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuejiao Hu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qianyun Deng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Junmin Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jierong Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zixia Wang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiqin Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Fang","author_inst":"Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haijian Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunhu Zhao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pan Yu","author_inst":"Genskey Biotechnology Co.

Among hypertensive subjects (n=543), the proportion of those treated with ARBs or ACEi were 88.4%, 78.7% and 80.6% among patients with mild, severe and very severe\/lethal disease, respectively. At multivariate analysis, no association was observed between therapy and disease severity (Adjusted OR for very severe\/lethal COVID-19: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.50-1.49). Significant predictors of severe disease were older age (with AORs largely increasing after 70 years of age), male gender (AOR: 1.76; 1.40-2.23), diabetes (AOR: 1.52; 1.05-2.18), CVD (AOR: 1.88; 1.32-2.70) and COPD (1.88; 1.11-3.20). Only gender, age and diabetes also predicted very severe\/lethal disease. Conclusion: No association was found between COVID-19 severity and treatment with ARBs and\/or ACEi, supporting the recommendation to continue medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Bravi","author_inst":"\"Sant'Anna\" University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Elena Flacco","author_inst":"Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tiziano Carradori","author_inst":"\"Sant'Anna\" University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Alberto Volta","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Cosenza","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Aldo De Togni","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Acuti Martellucci","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University of the Marche Region, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giustino Parruti","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Pescara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108860","rel_title":"Immunity after COVID-19: protection or sensitization ?","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108860","rel_abs":"Motivated by historical and present clinical observations, we discuss the possible unfavorable evolution of the immunity (similar to documented antibody-dependent enhancement scenarios) after a first infection with COVID-19.

The disease has spread very swiftly worldwide. A timely clue which includes the estimation of the incubation period among COVID-19 patients can allow governments and healthcare authorities to act accordingly. Objectives: to undertake a review and critical appraisal of all published\/preprint reports that offer an estimation of incubation periods for COVID-19. Eligibility criteria: This research looked for all relevant published articles between the dates of December 1, 2019, and April 25, 2020, i.e. those that were related to the COVID-19 incubation period. Papers were included if they were written in English, and involved human participants. Papers were excluded if they were not original (e.g. reviews, editorials, letters, commentaries, or duplications). Sources of evidence: COVID-19 Open Research Dataset supplied by Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology as well as PubMed and Embase via Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Charting methods: A data-charting form was jointly developed by the two reviewers (NZ and EA), to determine which variables to extract. The two reviewers independently charted the data, discussed the results, and updated the data-charting form. Results and conclusions: screening was undertaken 44,000 articles with a final selection of 25 studies referring to 18 different experimental projects related to the estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19. The majority of extant published estimates offer empirical evidence showing that the incubation period for the virus is a mean of 7.8 days, with a median of 5.01 days, which falls into the ranges proposed by the WHO (0 to 14 days) and the ECDC (2 to 12 days). Nevertheless, a number of authors proposed that quarantine time should be a minimum of 14 days and that for estimates of mortality risks a median time delay of 13 days between illness and mortality should be under consideration. It is unclear as to whether any correlation exists between the age of patients and the length of time they incubate the virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nazar Zaki","author_inst":"UAEU, UAE"},{"author_name":"Elfadil Abdalla Mohamed","author_inst":"Ajman University, UAE"},{"author_name":"Tiziano Carradori","author_inst":"\"Sant'Anna\" University Hospital of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Alberto Volta","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Cosenza","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Aldo De Togni","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Acuti Martellucci","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, University of the Marche Region, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giustino Parruti","author_inst":"Local Health Authority of Pescara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108605","rel_title":"Spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108605","rel_abs":"Background The spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been mainly described in form of case series or retrospective studies. In this study, we aimed to provide a coherent overview from published studies of the duration of viral detection and viral load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity and age. Method We systematically searched PubMed\/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1. November 2019 and 23rd of April 2020. We included studies that reported individual viral data over time measuring negative conversion by two consecutive negative tests, individual clinical severity and age. We excluded studies that reported viral data as patient fraction, reported only baseline data, included solely asymptomatic patients or were interventional studies. Extracted data included author, title, design, sample size, thresholds and genes of RT-PCR, patient age, COVID-19 severity, clinical characteristics, treatment, location of viral sampling, duration of viral detection, and viral load. We pooled the data of selected studies to determine effect estimates of duration of viral detection. Combined viral load was visualized over time. Findings Out of 7226 titles screened, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis and 22 studies in the quantitative analysis comprising 650 COVID-19 patients. The pooled estimate of the duration of positive detection of the virus was in mild adult patients 12.1 days (CI: 10.12, 14.05) after symptom onset in the upper respiratory tract (URT), 24.1 days (CI: 10.02, 38.19) in lower respiratory tract (LRT), and 15.5 days (CI: 8.04, 22.88) in faeces. Further, in mild adult patients, the maximum viral load was ~ 6.61 x 108 viral copies\/mL in the URT and ~ 2.69 x 108 viral copies\/mL in the LRT, within the first week of symptom onset. The maximum viral load in faeces was reported as ~ 3.55 x 107 copies\/mL on Day 9. In moderate-severe adult patients, the pooled estimate of mean duration of positive viral detection in the URT was 15.8 days (CI: 11.12, 20.56) after symptom onset, 23.2 days (CI: 21.49, 24.97) in the LRT, 20.8 days (CI: 16.40, 25.17) in faeces. The maximum viral load was 4.60 x 109 copies\/mL on Day 8 in the URT, 3.45 x 108 copies\/mL on Day 11 in the LRT, 2.76 x 106 copies\/mL on Day 18 in faeces and 1 x 104 copies\/mL on Day 3 in blood. In children with mild symptoms, the pooled estimate of the mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 viral detection was 11.1 days (CI: 7.14, 15.11) in the URT and 16.0 days (CI: 11.49, 20,47) in the faeces, without reporting quantitative viral data. Viral positivity was detected in the urine and eye in one patient. Interpretation Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the URT, the LRT and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT, whereas the differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection in feces and the URT for moderate-severe patients was shown. Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in the URT within first weak of infection, whereas maximum viral load has been observed to occur later and within the second week of infection in the LRT.

Effective prioritization of these measures can be determined by understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of three parameters: (i) secondary attack rate (SAR) in various settings, (ii) clinical onset serial interval (SI), and (iii) the proportion of asymptomatic infection. Methods and Findings We searched PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, for articles describing SARS-CoV-2 attack rate, SI, and asymptomatic infection. Studies were included if they presented original data for estimating point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the three parameters. Random effects models were constructed to pool SAR, mean SI, and asymptomatic proportion. Risk ratios were used to examine differences in transmission risk by setting, type of contact, and symptom status of the index case. Publication and related bias were assessed by funnel plots and Egger's meta-regression test for small-study effects. Our search strategy for SAR, SI, and asymptomatic infection identified 459, 572, and 1624 studies respectively. Of these, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria for SAR, 18 studies for SI, and 66 studies for asymptomatic infection. We estimated the pooled household SAR at 15.4% (95% CI: 12.2%, 18.7%) compared to 4.0% (95% CI: 2.8%, 5.2%) in non-household settings. We observed variation across settings; however, the small number of studies limited power to detect associations and sources of heterogeneity. SAR of symptomatic index cases is significantly higher than cases that were symptom-free at diagnosis (RR 2.55, 95% CI: 1.47, 4.45). Adults appear to be more susceptible to transmission than children (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96). The pooled mean SI is estimated at 4.87 days (95% CI: 3.98, 5.77). The pooled proportion of cases who had no symptoms at diagnosis is 25.9% (95% CI: 18.8%, 33.1%). Conclusions Based our pooled estimates, 10 infected symptomatic persons living with 100 contacts would result in 15 additional cases in <5 days. To be effective, quarantine of contacts should occur within 3 days of symptom onset. If testing and tracing relies on symptoms, one-quarter of cases would be missed. As such, while aggressive contact tracing strategies may be appropriate early in an outbreak, as it progresses, control measures should transition to account for SAR variability across settings. Targeted strategies focusing on high-density enclosed settings may be effective without overly restricting social movement.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ali Rosledzana","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Liling Chaw","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Matthew Griffith","author_inst":"Western Pacific Regional Office (Manila), World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Roberta Pastore","author_inst":"Western Pacific Regional Office (Manila), World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108951","rel_title":"Effective Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies in Patient Serum using Lentivirus Particles Pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108951","rel_abs":"Pseuodotyped particles have significant importance and use in virology as tools for studying the biology of highly pathogenic viruses in a lower biosafety environment. The biological, chemical, and serological studies of the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly aided by the development and optimization of a suitable pseudotyping system. Here, we pseudotyped the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SPG) on a retroviral (MMLV) as well as a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the transduction efficiency in several mammalian cell lines expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2. While MMLV pseudotyped the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) efficiently, it could not pseudotype SPG. In contrast, pLV pseudotyped both glycoproteins efficiently; however, much higher titers of pLV-G particles were produced. Among all the tested mammalian cells, 293Ts expressing hACE2 were most efficiently transduced using the pLV-S system. The pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by diluted serum (>:640) from a recently recovered COVID-19 patient who showed high SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG levels. In summary, pLV-S pseudotyped virus provides a valid screening tool for the presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent patient serum.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ritesh Tandon","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dipanwita Mitra","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Poonam Sharma","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephan J Stray","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John T Bates","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gailen D Marshall","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roberta Pastore","author_inst":"Western Pacific Regional Office (Manila), World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Mantovani","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Surgery, University Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Wang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shan Li","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"MOE International Joint Lab for Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Tieying Hou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20108639","rel_title":"Validation of the Kuwait Progression Indicator Score for predicting progression of severity in COVID19","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20108639","rel_abs":"Introduction: Identifying patients with COVID19, at risk of having a severe clinical course during their hospitalization is important for appropriate allocation of clinical resources. We recently described the Kuwait Progression Indicator based on laboratory findings, in an initial training cohort derived from the first series of 1096 consecutive patients admitted to Jaber AlAhmad AlSabah Hospital in Kuwait. The aim of this study was to validate the KPI scoring system in an independent cohort of patients with COVID19. Methodology: Data was collected prospectively for consecutive patients admitted to Jaber AlAhmad AlSabah Hospital in Kuwait between 24th February till 28th April 2020. Patients were grouped according to the severity of their clinical course as their main outcome, based on clinical and radiological parameters, with ICU admission and death as secondary outcomes. Model discrimination was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) while model calibration was assessed through a calibration plot and measures of slope and calibration in the large (CITL). Results: Of 752 patients not used in model development previously, 414 met the criteria for inclusion in this validation study. The baseline characteristics for these 752 patients were similar to the patients that were included in our validation cohort. The area under the curve was equal to 0.904 (95% CI, between 0.867 to 0.942), indicating good model discrimination. The calibration plot and CITL confirmed reasonably good model calibration. Sensitivity and specificity were above 90% for the low and high risk levels respectively. Conclusions: We were able to validate our previously described laboratory based prognostic scoring system for COVID19 patients, to predict which patients progressed to a severe clinical course.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Al Youha","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suhail A.

Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in congregate shelters is high, but shelter characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission are currently unknown. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study across five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. We tested people 18 years of age and older staying in Rhode Island congregate shelters in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey instrument was designed and implemented based on an a priori sample size. All consented participants reported basic demographics, recent travel, duration of time at the shelter, any symptomatology, and had their temperature and pulse oximetry measured. Each participant was tested for COVID-19 using nasopharyngeal swabbing. Shelter characteristics about location, occupancy, resident length of stay, and COVID-19 mitigation strategies were collected through structured phone questionnaire with shelter staff. Results: A total of 302 individuals were screened and 299 participated across five homeless shelters. The median age was 47.9 (range 18-85) and 20% were female. Of the 299 participants, 35 (11.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2; rates varied among shelters, ranging from 0% to 35%. Among the participants in the study, 5% had a new cough, 4% shortness of breath, and 3% reported loss of taste or smell. Symptom prevalence did not vary significantly between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 groups. Regular symptom screening was not associated with lower infection rates. Shelters with higher rates of positivity were in more densely populated areas, cared for a more transient populations, and instituted fewer social distancing practices for sleeping arrangements or mealtimes. Conclusions and Relevance: Residents of congregate shelters are at increased risk for asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To reduce transmission and enable continuation of low-threshold shelter services, there is a need for universal testing, implementation of infection control and physical distancing measures within congregate shelters, and expansion of non-congregate supportive housing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Samuels","author_inst":"Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Karb","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Rahul Vanjani","author_inst":"Division of General Internal Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"M.

However, the effectiveness of these drugs in large populations is unclear. Subjects and Methods: As of May 2020, data analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Review and Assessment Service database in Korea. Using the COVID-19 and claims data of the past 5 years, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Results: Totally, data of 67850 subjects were accessible. Of these, 5080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP-4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.135-0.971], and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251-1.431). No synergy was observed for subjects using both drugs. Conclusion: This population-based study suggests that DPP-4i is significantly associated with a better clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. However, the effect of RAS blockade is not significant.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sang Youl Rhee","author_inst":"Kyung Hee University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeongwoo Lee","author_inst":"Hanmi Pharm.

By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17st of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130033-315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235-270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected. Based on the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), cumulated infections forecasts provided by the EDM applied to WR performed better across all scenarios than the Gompertz model. An exponential decay model applied to the cumulated and weighted average daily growth rate appears to be useful in estimating the number of cases and peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and the model was more reliable in the exponential growth phase.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Bartolomeo","author_inst":"University of Bari Aldo Moro"},{"author_name":"Paolo Trerotoli","author_inst":"University of Bari Aldo Moro"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Serio","author_inst":"University of Bari Aldo Moro"},{"author_name":"Dae-Sung Kyoung","author_inst":"Hanmi Pharm.

However, striking a balance between a scientifically precise multivariable risk prediction model, and a model which can easily be used by the general public, remains a challenge. A list of risk criteria, as defined by the CDC for example, provides a simple solution, but may be too inclusive by classifying a substantial portion of the population at high risk. Score-based risk classification tools may provide a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity. Objective: To create a score-based risk classification tool for severe COVID-19. Methods: The outcome was defined as a composite of being labeled severe during hospitalization or dying due to COVID-19. The risk classification tool was developed using retrospective data from all COVID-19 patients that were diagnosed until April 1st, 2020 in a large healthcare organization (\"training set\"). The developed tool combines 10 risk factors using simple summation, and defines three risk levels according to the patient's age and number of accumulated risk points - basic risk, high risk and very-high risk (the last two levels are also considered together as the elevated risk group). The tool's performance in accurately identifying individuals at risk was evaluated using a \"temporal test set\" of COVID-19 patients diagnosed between April 2nd and April 22nd, 2020, later than those used for model development. The tool's performance was also compared to that of the CDC's criteria. The healthcare organization's general population was used to evaluate the proportion of patients that would be classified to each of the model's risk levels and as elevated risk by the CDC criteria. Results: A total of 2,421, 2,624 and 4,631,168 individuals were included in the training, test, and general population cohorts, respectively. The outcome rate in the training and test sets was 5%. Overall, 18% of the general population would be classified at elevated risk by the model, with a resulting sensitivity of 92%, compared to 35% that would be defined as elevated risk by the CDC criteria, with a resulting sensitivity of 96%. Within the model's elevated risk groups, the high and very-high risk groups comprised 15% and 3% of the general population, with an incidence rate (PPV) of 15% and 33%, respectively. Discussion: A simple to communicate score-based risk classification tool classifies at elevated risk about half of the population that is considered to have an elevated risk by the CDC risk criteria, with only a 4% reduction in sensitivity. The model's ability to further divide the elevated risk population into two markedly different subgroups allows providing more refined recommendations to the general public and limiting the restrictions of social distancing to a smaller and more manageable subset of the population. This model was adopted by the Israeli ministry of health as its risk classification tool for COVID-19 lab tests prioritization and for targeting its instructions on risk management during the lockdown exit strategy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noa Dagan","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noam Barda","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dan Riesel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Itamar Grotto","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Siegal Sadetzki","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ali Y.

The CDC's decision to present the racial\/ethnic distribution of COVID-19 deaths at the state level alongside re-weighted racial\/ethnic population distributions -- in effect, a geographic adjustment -- makes it seem that Whites have the highest death rates. Age adjustment procedures used by others, including the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, lead to the opposite conclusion that Blacks and Hispanics are dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. In this paper, we use indirect standardization methods to adjust per-capita death rates for both age and geography simultaneously, avoiding the one-sided adjustment procedures currently in use. Using CDC data, we find age-and-place- adjusted COVID-19 death rates are 80% higher for Blacks and more than 50% higher for Hispanics, relative to Whites, on a national level, while there is almost no disparity for Asians. State-specific estimates show wide variation in mortality disparities. Comparison with non- epidemic mortality reveals potential roles for pre-existing health disparities and differential rates of infection and care.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Robert Goldstein","author_inst":"Department of Demography, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Serge Atherwood","author_inst":"Department of Demography, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Dan Riesel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Itamar Grotto","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Siegal Sadetzki","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ali Y.

At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V (t), and unreported infected cases U(t). This work measures the basic reproduction number R0, which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an R0 = 2.73. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an Rt = 0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ines Abdeljaoued-Tej","author_inst":"BIMS Laboratory, LR16IPT09, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Moritz Schwarz","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sihan Li","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yangsiyu Lu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anant Jani","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ali Y.

To facilitate the transfer of infectious samples from high containment laboratories, we have tested methods commonly used to inactivate virus and prepare the sample for additional experiments.

These protocols can provide a framework for in house inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in other laboratories, ensuring the safe use of samples in lower containment levels.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward I Patterson","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tessa Prince","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Enyia R Anderson","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aitor Casas-Sanchez","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shirley L Smith","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Cintia Cansado-Utrilla","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Grant L Hughes","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Salman K.

Humoral immune responses likely play an important role in containing SARS-CoV-2, however, the determinants of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are unclear.\n\nMethodsUsing immunoassays specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we determined SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera and mucosal fluids of two cohorts, including patients with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 56; median age 61 years) with mild versus severe COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers (n = 109; median age 36 years) with or without symptoms and tested negative or positive by RT-qPCR.\n\nFindingsOn average, SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA titers in mild COVID-19 cases became positive eight days after symptom onset and were often transient, whereas serum IgG levels remained negative or reached positive values 9-10 days after symptom onset. Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly significant increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA and IgG titers as a function of duration since symptom onset, independent of patient age and comorbidities. Very high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA correlated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, some of the SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG serum titers had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies in their nasal fluids and tears. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA levels in nasal fluids of these healthcare workers were inversely correlated with patient age.\n\nInterpretationThese data show that systemic IgA and IgG production against SARS-CoV-2 develops mainly in severe COVID-19, with very high IgA levels seen in patients with severe ARDS, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient serum titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies but stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA secretion. The findings suggest four grades of antibody responses dependent on COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlo Cervia","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jakob Nilsson","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Yves Zurbuchen","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alan Valaperti","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jens Schreiner","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Aline Wolfensberger","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, USZ, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Miro E.

While the elderly appear at high risk for severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 among children have been relatively rare. Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the developing mouse lung with temporally-resolved RNA-in-situ hybridization (ISH) in mouse and human lung tissue, we found that expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein primer TMPRSS2 was highest in ciliated cells and type I alveolar epithelial cells (AT1), and TMPRSS2 expression was increased with aging in mice and humans. Analysis of autopsy tissue from fatal COVID-19 cases revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected most frequently in ciliated and secretory cells in the airway epithelium and AT1 cells in the peripheral lung. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highly colocalized in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Together, these data demonstrate the cellular spectrum infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung epithelium, and suggest that developmental regulation of TMPRSS2 may underlie the relative protection of infants and children from severe respiratory illness.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryce A Schuler","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"A Christian Habermann","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Erin J Plosa","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Chase J Taylor","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Christopher S Jetter","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Meghan E Kapp","author_inst":"Department Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"John Benjamin","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Peter Gulleman","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"David S Nichols","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Lior Z Braunstein","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York"},{"author_name":"Michael H Koval","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta,  GA; Department of Cell Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Susan H Guttentag","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Timothy S Blackwell","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and D"},{"author_name":"- Vanderbilt COVID-19 Consortium Cohort","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Steven A Webber","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Banovich","author_inst":"Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ"},{"author_name":"Jonathan A Kropski","author_inst":"Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and D"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MS Sucre","author_inst":"Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt"},{"author_name":"- HCA Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Held","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, at Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elsbeth Probst-Mueller","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvana K.
