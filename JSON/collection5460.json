It is known that exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. With the aim to improve the knowledge in this area, we developed a cross-sectional study, in which we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy control individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our results suggest that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells also followed this pattern, whereas CD141+ conventional and CD123hi plasmacytoid dendritic cells were depleted from blood but were absent in the lungs. Thus, this study increases the knowledge on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ildefonso Sanchez-Cerrillo","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Landete","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Aldave","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Santiago Sanchez-Alonso","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ana Sanchez-Azofra","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ana Marcos-Jimenez","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Elena Avalos","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ana Alcaraz-Serna","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ignacio de los Santos","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases division from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Tamara Mateu-Albero","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Laura Esparcia","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Celia Lopez-Sanz","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana del Campo Guerola","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Calzada","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"Rheumatology Service from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Julio Ancochea","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20100982","rel_title":"Correlation between PCR Examination Rate among the Population and the Containment of Pandemic of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20100982","rel_abs":"We investigated the relation between PCR examination rate among population and the success of containment of COVID-19 for each country.

In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients (n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID-19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is well-known to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients. Metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation and disease severity (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study of the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 infection in a clinical cohort identified amino acid metabolism (especially kynurenine and cysteine\/taurine) and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiffany Thomas","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Davide Stefanoni","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Julie A Reisz","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Travis Nemkov","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Bertolone","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard O Francis","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Krystalyn E Hudson","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"James C Zimring","author_inst":"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kirk C Hansen","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven L Spitalnik","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Angelo D'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana del Campo Guerola","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Calzada","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"Rheumatology Service from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Julio Ancochea","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20101071","rel_title":"Estimation of the true infection rate and infection fatality rate of COVID-19 in the whole population of each country","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20101071","rel_abs":"The True Infection Rate (TIR) in the whole population of each country and the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are unknown.

The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for data scientists to model COVID-19, when the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 are yet to be fully explained. The uncertainty around the COVID-19 with no vaccine and effective medicine available until today create additional pressure on the epidemiologists and policy makers. In such a crucial situation, it is very important to predict infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the preparation of healthcare service. In this paper, we have tried to understand the spreading capability of COVID-19 in India taking into account of the lockdown period. The numbers of confirmed cases are increased in India and states in the past few weeks. A differential equation based simple model has been used to understand the pattern of COVID-19 in India and some states. Our findings suggest that the physical distancing and lockdown strategies implemented in India are successfully reducing the spread and that the tempo of pandemic growth has slowed in recent days.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brijesh P Singh","author_inst":"Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi INDIA"},{"author_name":"Gunjan Singh","author_inst":"Amity University, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Takayoshi Shimohata","author_inst":"Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masahito Kobayashi","author_inst":"Yokohama National University"},{"author_name":"Masashi Idogawa","author_inst":"Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hideyuki Hayashi","author_inst":"Osaka Medical College"},{"author_name":"Krystalyn E Hudson","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"James C Zimring","author_inst":"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kirk C Hansen","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven L Spitalnik","author_inst":"Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Angelo D'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana del Campo Guerola","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Calzada","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"Rheumatology Service from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"Immunology Unit from Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Joan B Soriano","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Julio Ancochea","author_inst":"Pneumology Department from Hospital Universitario de la Princesa"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0_ng","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20101345","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Spain: age, Interleukin-6, C Reactive Protein and lymphocytes as key clues from a multicentre retrospective study","rel_date":"2020-05-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20101345","rel_abs":"Background. SARS-CoV-2 infection has widely spread to the hugest public health challenge to date, COVID-19 pandemic. Different fatality rates among countries are probably due to non-standardized records being carried out by local health authorities. Spanish case-fatality rate is 11.94%, far higher to those reported in Asia or by other European countries. A multicenter retrospective study was performed of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 574 Spanish COVID-19 hospitalized patients and their outcomes. The use of use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was also analyzed as a risk factor. Results. In this study, 27.7% of cases presented a mild curse, 42% a moderate one and for 30.3% of cases, the course was severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63.2). Fifty eight percent (58.9%) of patients were male. Interleukin 6 was higher as severity increased. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19 and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was associated with moderate or mild disease courses. Conclusions. Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension or diabetes, determined more frequent severe forms of the disease in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Our cases are older than those so far reported and clinical course of the disease is found to be impaired by age. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for immune system effectors severity-related hampering. Adaptive immunity would go exhausted and a huge ineffective and almost deleterious innate response would account for COVID-19 severity. Renin-angiotensin system blockers treatment in hypertensive patients has a protective effect as regarding COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aurora Jurado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia"},{"author_name":"M Carmen Martin","author_inst":"Centro de Hemoterapia y Hemodonacion de Castilla y Leon"},{"author_name":"Cristina Abad-Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid"},{"author_name":"Antonio Orduna","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid"},{"author_name":"Alba Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Esther Ocana","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Oscar Yarce","author_inst":"Hospital Reina Sofia"},{"author_name":"Ana M Navas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Pereira","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.095133","rel_title":"Identification of conserved epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein.","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.095133","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first occurred in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, is a novel virus that causes a severe acute respiratory disease.

We herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their B cell and T cell epitopes, previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes. For this purpose, we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for conserved epitopes that may help to develop long-lasting, broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Forcelloni","author_inst":"University of Rome \"La Sapienza\""},{"author_name":"Anna Benedetti","author_inst":"University of Rome \"La Sapienza\""},{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giansanti","author_inst":"Sapienza Universita di Roma"},{"author_name":"Alba Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Esther Ocana","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen"},{"author_name":"Oscar Yarce","author_inst":"Hospital Reina Sofia"},{"author_name":"Ana M Navas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Pereira","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.095885","rel_title":"Predicting the Immunogenicity of T cell epitopes: From HIV to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.095885","rel_abs":"We describe a physics-based learning model for predicting the immunogenicity of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes derived from diverse pathogens, given a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genotype.

The method is more accurate than publicly available models. Our model predicts that only a fraction of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that have been predicted to bind to HLA molecules is immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage, but the immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so. Our model predicts that several immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 CTL epitopes are identical to those contained in low-pathogenicity coronaviruses circulating in the population.

This pandemic is the result of a zoonotic coronavirus, Severe Acute Respirsatory Syndrom Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is believed to have originated in bats and transferred to humans possibly through an intermediate host species (Zhou et al. 2020; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2020). The virus attacks host cells by attaching to a cell membrane surface protein receptor called ACE2 (Ge et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2020). Given the critical role of ACE2 as a binding receptor for a number of coronaviruses, we studied the molecular evolution of ACE2 in a diverse range of mammalian species. Using ACE2 as the target protein, we wanted to specifically test the Red Queen hypothesis (Dawkins and Krebs 1979) where the parasite and host engage in an evolutionary arms race which can result in positive selection of their traits associated to their fitness and survival. Our results clearly show a phylogenetically broad evolutionary response, in the form of positive selection detected at the codon-level in ACE2. We see positive selection occurring at deep branches as well as 13 incidents at the species level. We found the strongest level of positive selection in Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), donkey (Equus asinus), large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), and dog (Canis lupus familiaris). At the codon-level, we found up to 10% of ACE2 codons are impacted by positive selection in the mammalian lineages studied. This phylogenetically broad evolutionary arms race can contribute to the emergence of new strains of coronaviruses in different mammalian lineages with a potential to transfer between species given the common binding receptor ACE2. Our study provides a molecular evolutionary perspective to the current pandemic and sheds light on its evolutionary mechanisms.\n\n\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\" (Theodosius Dobzhansky)","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehrdad Hajibabaei","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Gregory AC Singer","author_inst":"Centre for Environmental Genomics Applications, eDNAtec Inc."},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Mafessoni","author_inst":"Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz, 6, 04103, Leipzig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefano Motta","author_inst":"Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 2, 20126, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Cicconardi","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Bertorelle","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Via Luigi Borsari 46, 44121, Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Di Marino","author_inst":"Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, New York-Marche Structural Biology Center (NY-MaSBiC), Polytechnic University of Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, 6013"},{"author_name":"Ana M Navas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Pereira","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20069732","rel_title":"COVID-19 and Environmental factors.

We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the impact of environmental factors on human coronaviruses. Temperature, humidity and other environmental factors have been recorded as environmental drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and in other countries. Higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. In our review, the analysis of 23 studies show evidence that high temperature and high humidity reduce the COVID-19 transmission. However, further studies concerning other environmental (namely meteorological) factors role should be conducted in order to further prove this correlation.

In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. This disruption to daily life may have consequences for eating and physical activity patterns. Methods: In this observational study, we examined the effect of isolation measures, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March\/April), on diet (24-hour diet recall, ASA-24) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns among third-year biomedical students in Brisbane, Australia. Findings were compared to students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years. Results: In females, energy intake was ~20% greater in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019, and the frequency of snacking and energy density of consumed snacks were also increased. In males, there was no difference in energy intake or snacking behaviour. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes, whereby fewer students undertook any walking activity and, of those that did, time spent doing so was less compared with 2018 and 2019. The proportion of students reporting any vigorous activity was not different for males or females but, among males who participated in this level of activity, the duration was less in 2020 compared with previous years. The proportion of male and female students achieving sufficient levels of activity, defined by at least 150 mins over at least 5 sessions, was ~30% less in 2020. Indeed, the majority of students reported as having undertaken less physical activity than usual. Conclusions: Increased energy intake for females and reduced physical activity for males and females demonstrate impacts of isolation measures that may have deleterious consequences for physical and mental wellbeing, with the potential to affect long-term nutrition and activity patterns.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linda A Gallo","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Tania F Gallo","author_inst":"North Melbourne Football Club"},{"author_name":"Sophia L Young","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Karen M Moritz","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Akison","author_inst":"The Univeristy of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Bertorelle","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Via Luigi Borsari 46, 44121, Ferrara, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Di Marino","author_inst":"Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, New York-Marche Structural Biology Center (NY-MaSBiC), Polytechnic University of Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, 6013"},{"author_name":"Ana M Navas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Trujillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernandez-Pereira","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nutrition"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20082396","rel_title":"Virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19.","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20082396","rel_abs":"Objectives: To describe the implementation and early experience of virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19. Design: observational cohort study. Setting: large Australian metropolitan health service with established virtual health care program and remote patient monitoring capability. Participants: patients with COVID-19 living within the health service who can self-isolate safely, do not require immediate admission to an inpatient setting, have no major active comorbid illness and can be managed at home or other suitable accommodation. Main outcome measures: care escalation rates, including hospital admission. Results: between 11-29 March 2020, 162\/173 (93.6%) locally diagnosed patients with COVID-19 were accepted to the virtual health care program, median age 38y (range 11-79). For the 62 patients discharged during this period the median length of stay was 8 days (range 1-17). The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per Registered Nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 times (range 1-30) during this period, with video consultations used 66.3% of the time; 132\/162 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low: ambulance attendance, 5 (3%); ED attendance, 4 (2.5%); hospital admission, 3 (1.9%). There were no deaths. Conclusions: community-based virtual health care is feasible for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian context for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them including strategies supporting consumer use of health information technologies.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Owen Hutchings","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Cassandra Dearing","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Dianna Jagers","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Miranda Shaw","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Freya Raffan","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jones","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Richard Taggart","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Tim Sinclair","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Teresa Anderson","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Angus G Ritchie","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20088369","rel_title":"Medical overuse in the Iranian healthcare system: a systematic scoping review and practical recommendations for decreasing medical overuse during unexpected COVID-19 pandemic opportunity","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20088369","rel_abs":"Background: Overuse of medical care is a major problem across health systems as well as in Iran.

Almost all of the studies only described the magnitude of unnecessary overuse. Unnecessary overuse of Antibiotics, MRI and CT-scan were the most reported topics. The ranges of their overuse proportion were as follows; Antibiotic (31 to 97%); MRI (33 to 88%), and CT-scan (19 to 50%). Conclusions: Our review showed, even so, the magnitude of unnecessary overuse of medical services is high but there are only a few interventional studies in clinical and administrative level for finding effective methods for decreasing these unnecessary services. Researchers should be encouraged to conducting interventional studies. We suggest the ministry of health to use the golden opportunity of COVID-19 epidemic for designing Iran national policy and action plan for controlling and preventing unnecessary health care services and including a section for Interventional Research in the action plan.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Zakaria Pezeshki","author_inst":"Tabriz university of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Janati","author_inst":"Tabriz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Morteza Arab-Zozani","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miranda Shaw","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Freya Raffan","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Aaron Jones","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Richard Taggart","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Tim Sinclair","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Teresa Anderson","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Angus G Ritchie","author_inst":"Sydney Local Health District"},{"author_name":"Esther Vergara","author_inst":"Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez","author_inst":"Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez"},{"author_name":"Bibiana Quirant","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Eva Martinez-Caceres","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias i Pujols"},{"author_name":"Manuel Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Janire Perurena","author_inst":"Hospital universitario Vall de Hebron"},{"author_name":"Juana Gil","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Sergi Cantenys","author_inst":"Hospital general Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Gema Gonzalez-Martinez","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil,"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Martinez-Saavedra","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular-Materno Infantil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rojo","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de a Coruna"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marco","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Sergio Mora","author_inst":"Hospital general de Alicante"},{"author_name":"Jesus Ontanon","author_inst":"Hospital general universitario de Albacete"},{"author_name":"Marcos Lopez-Hoyos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Ocejo-Vinyals","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Josefa Melero","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20092338","rel_title":"Saliva is less sensitive than nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 detection in the community setting","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20092338","rel_abs":"The use of saliva collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in the ambulatory setting provides several advantages when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), including ease of self-collection and reduced use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

We investigated the utility of saliva collection in the community setting at Renown Health in a prospective Diagnostic Cohort of 88 patients and in a Convalescent Cohort of 24 patients. In the Diagnostic Cohort, we find that saliva collection has reduced sensitivity (~30% less) relative than NPS.

Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now, therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of COVID-19. Methods: Firstly we constructed genetically modified food-grade probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, with sequence of seven tandem repeats of mature human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter to produce the cas001. A total of 20 healthy SD rats, half male and half female (There were five male and five female in the control group, the same in treatment group) were used to observe the acute toxic reaction and death after daily administration of cas001 for three weeks, which helps to provide necessary reference basis for clinical dose selection, verificaition of toxic reaction and possible target organs. According to the estimated clinical dosage of 1 x 108CFU \/kg\/day, considering the conversion of body surface area, the dose for rats should be multiplied by 6.17 to 6 x 108 CFU\/kg\/day. We administrated 100 times higher dose at 6 x 1010 CFU\/kg\/day to rats. In order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cas001, male SD rats (body weight 250-300g, 1 x 1010 \/animal, n=3) were given oral administration of LL-37 bacteria powder. The concentration of LL-37 in the blood before and after gavage was detected by ELISA kit (Hycult biotechnology Cat# HK321). Human clinical study was approved by Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (S2020-074-04) and a total of 11 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled in Wuhan hankou hospital and Huoshenshan hospital. They were enrolled voluntarily and all patients signed informed consent. Among them, there were 5 males and 6 females, aged 55 {+\/-} 12 (36-70) years old, and the duration from onset to medication enrollment was 35 {+\/-} 19 (5-68) days. 6 patients were nucleic acid positive and 5 patients were nucleic acid negative when they were enrolled. All patients received the oral drug cas001 treatment according to requirement(1 x 109 CFU\/capsule, 3 capsules\/time, three times a day for 3weeks), with an average follow-up time of 33 {+\/-} 15 days (see table 1 for the results). Findings: Western blot analysis shows that reasonable amount of LL-37 were induced by different concentrations of nisin, which means we have successfully constructed cas001. In the pre-clinical safety evaluation test, after three weeks administration of cas001, no adverse effects were observed on the rat's body weight, food and water intake, hematological or serum biochemical parameters. The results showed that the LD50 of cas001 was higher than that of the 100 times of the expected clinical dose of 6 x 1010 CFU\/day. These results showed that cas001 could be safe in animal experiments. In addition, rat pharmacokinetics results showed that the serum concentration of LL-37 reached peak 2 hours after gavage of cas001 and returned to basal level 6 hours after gavage. During study period, the volunteers did not feel any discomfort while taking the cas001 capsules, and two hours after oral administration, the concentration of LL-37 were increased in healthy volunteers. cas001 shows definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms and may play a role in the improvement of results of nucleic acid test and lung CT test. 11 patients enrolled showed good compliance, tolerance, subjective feeling and actively interacted with the doctors. None of the patients had any adverse reactions. Conclusions Based on above observations, we conclude here that as an oral anti-viral agent, cas001 displayed good safety profiles. It is very hard to reach conclusion of clinical outcomes related to the cas001, although changes of several symptoms indicate encouraging findings.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanlin Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yiming Zhao","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxiao Jiang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuying Zhao","author_inst":"980 Hospital of PLA Joint Logistics Support Forces"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Chen Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Meng Dong","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20087734","rel_title":"Nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa and albuterol administered to mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients: A case series","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20087734","rel_abs":"Background Mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a mortality of 24-53%, in part due to distal mucopurulent secretions interfering with ventilation. Dornase alfa is recombinant human DNase 1 and digests DNA in mucoid sputum. Nebulized dornase alfa is FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19, acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for staff. Here, we report a single center case series where dornase alfa was administered through an in-line nebulizer system to minimize risk of virus aerosolization. Methods Demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were collected from the electronic medical records of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, including three requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO), treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli), between March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including longitudinal values capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed. Results Following nebulized in-line administration of dornase alfa with albuterol, the fraction of inspired oxygen requirements was reduced for all five patients. All patients remain alive and two patients have been discharged from the intensive care unit. No drug associated toxicities were identified. Conclusions The results presented in this case series suggest that dornase alfa will be well-tolerated by critically ill patients with COVID-19.

We determined the burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in persons residing in United States (US) who are at risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Methods Age (60 years or greater), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, and\/or malignancy were used to identify persons at risk for admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death with COVID-19 infection. Persons were classified as low risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (two or more risk factors present) using nationally representative sample of US adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017 and 2018 survey. Results Among a total of 5856 participants, 2386 (40.7%) were considered low risk, 1325 (22.6%) moderate risk, and 2145 persons (36.6%) as high risk for severe COVID-19 infection. The proportion of patients who had pre-existing stroke increased from 0.6% to 10.5% in low risk patients to high risk patients (odds ratio [OR]19.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]11.6-34.3). The proportion of who had pre-existing myocardial infection (MI) increased from 0.4% to 10.4% in low risk patients to high risk patients (OR 30.6, 95% CI 15.7-59.8). Conclusions A large proportion of persons in US who are at risk for developing severe COVID 19 infection are expected to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Further studies need to identify whether targeted strategies towards cardiovascular diseases can reduce the mortality in COVID-19 infected patients.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adnan I Qureshi","author_inst":"Zeenat Qureshi Stroke Institute"},{"author_name":"Alice S Chau","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington and the Center for Immunity and Immunotherapies, Seattle Children'"},{"author_name":"Mikala Egeblad","author_inst":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Betsy J Barnes","author_inst":"Center for Autoimmune, Musculoskeletal and Hematopoietic Diseases, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and the Departments of Molecular Medicine and P"},{"author_name":"Tobias Janowitz","author_inst":"Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Northwell Health Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Chen Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Meng Dong","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20086504","rel_title":"Modeling COVID 19 in the Basque Country: from introduction to control measure response","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20086504","rel_abs":"In March 2020, a multidisciplinary task force (so-called Basque Modelling Task Force, BMTF) was created to assist the Basque Health managers and the Basque Government during the COVID-19 responses. BMTF is a modeling team, working on different approaches, including statistical methods and artificial intelligence. In this paper we describe and present the results obtained by a new stochastic SHARUCD model framework which was able to describe the disease incidence data provided by the Basque Health Services. Our models differentiate mild and asymptomatic from severe infections prone to be hospitalized and were able to predict the course of the epidemic, from introduction to control measure response, providing important projections on the national health system necessities during the increased population demand on hospital admissions. Short and longer-term predictions were tested with good results adjusted to the current epidemiological data, showing that the partial lockdown measures were effective and enough to slow down disease transmission in the Basque Country. The growth rate ({lambda}(t)) is calculated from the model and from the data and the implications for the reproduction ratio r are shown. At the moment, the reproduction ratio (r(t)) is estimated to be below the threshold behavior of r=1, but still close to 1, meaning that although the number of new cases are decelerating, a careful monitoring of the development of the outbreak is required. This framework is now being used to monitor disease transmission while the country lockdown is gradually lifted, with insights to specific programs for a general policy of ''social distancing'' and home quarantining. These are the first publicly available modeling results for the Basque Country and the efforts will be continued taking into consideration the updated data and new information that are generated over time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maira Aguiar","author_inst":"1.

Psychological Distress (PD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of pandemics is not well known. The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown. Patients and methods We recruited patients in 4 groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Index (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients characteristics in order to better identify the one who were the most at-risk. Results The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 years (SD=13,71), 7.96% (141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 years (SD=8,14). In total, 38.06% (674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI [&ge;]15). An ANOVA analysis showed that sex (p=0.00132), unemployment (p=7.16x10-6) and depression (p=7.49x10-7) were significantly associated with a higher PDI score. Patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588). Conclusion Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high. These patients are also at increased risk to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Specific steps should be implemented to monitor and prevent PD through dedicated mental health policies if we want to limit the public health impact of COVID-19 in time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Chaix","author_inst":"Hospital Gui de Chauliac, Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Delamon","author_inst":"Wefight, Brain & Spine Institute, Paris"},{"author_name":"Arthur Guillemasse","author_inst":"Wefight, Brain & Spine Institute, Paris"},{"author_name":"Benoit Brouard","author_inst":"Wefight, Brain & Spine Institute, Paris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Emmanuel Bibault","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris"},{"author_name":"Ayat T Al-Meanazel","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Al Albayt University, Al Mafraq, Jordan."},{"author_name":"Osaid T Al Meanazel","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20096388","rel_title":"Behaviors and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from a cross-national Facebook survey","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20096388","rel_abs":"In the absence of medical treatment and vaccination, the mitigation and containment of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic relies on behavioral changes. Timely data on attitudes and behaviors are thus necessary to develop optimal intervention strategies and to assess the consequences of the pandemic for different demographic groups. We developed a rapid response monitoring system via a continuously run online survey (the \"COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey\") across eight countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States). The survey was specifically designed to collect key information on people's health status, behaviors, close social contacts, and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an innovative approach to recruit participants via targeted Facebook advertisement campaigns in order to generate balanced samples for post-stratification. In this paper, we present results for the period from March 13-April 19, 2020. We estimate important differences by sex: women show a substantially higher perception of threat along with a lower level of confidence in the health system. This is paralleled by sex-specific behaviors, with women more likely to adopt a wide range of preventive behaviors. We thus expect behavior to serve as a protective factor for women. Our findings also show a higher level of awareness and concern among older respondents, in line with the evidence that the elderly are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19. While across all the samples respondents were less concerned for themselves than for their country or for the world, we also observed substantial temporal and spatial heterogeneity in terms of confidence in institutions and responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Perrotta","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9 Grow","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Francesco Rampazzo","author_inst":"Centre for Population Change, University of Southampton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jorge Cimentada","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Del Fava","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sofia Gil-Clavel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Emilio Zagheni","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany"},{"author_name":"Zhe Luan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Yan","author_inst":"Yanbian University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Jiao","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chaoyue Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongyue Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cong Feng","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Le Tian","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Mu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congyong Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Zeng","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Hubei provincial Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders"},{"author_name":"Shibo Feng","author_inst":"Hankou Hospital of Wuhan City"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xizhou Guan","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haotian Yu","author_inst":"Hainan Hospital of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wanzhu Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gang Sun","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marta Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Cristina"},{"author_name":"Delia Almeida","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Silvia Medina","author_inst":"Complejo Hospitalario Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Carmen Vegas","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Yesenia Jimenez","author_inst":"Fundacion Jimenez Diaz"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Prada","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"David Monzon","author_inst":"Hospital de Donostia"},{"author_name":"Francisco Boix","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Vanesa Cunil","author_inst":"Hospital Son Espases"},{"author_name":"Juan Molina","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia-IMIBIC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20095844","rel_title":"Anxiety, depression, attitudes, and internet addiction during the initial phase of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Mexico.","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20095844","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives: To describe the prevalence and distribution of anxiety and depression among Mexican population, and to examine its association with internet addiction during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Primary and secondary outcome measures: Prevalence of anxiety, depression, internet addiction and sleep disorders and associated factors. Also, prevalence for anxiety and depression were compared to an historic control group. Results: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence for anxiety and depression was 50% (95% CI, 45.6% to 54.1%) and 27.6%, (95% CI 23.8% to 31.4%), respectively. We found a 51% (33% to 50%) increase in anxiety and up to 86% increase in depression uring the initial weeks of the lock-down compared to the control group. According to the IAT questionnaire, 62.7% (95% CI 58.6% to 68.8%) of our population had some degree of internet addiction. Odds ratio for development of anxiety symptoms was 2.02 (95% CI1.56-2.1, p=0.0001) and for depression was 2.15 (95% CI 1.59-2.9, p=0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, younger age (p=0.006), sleep problems (p=0.000), and internet addiction ( p=0.000) were associated with anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Our study provides valuable information on the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Mexican population. As in other parts of the globe, in Mexico, fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection has had devastating consequences on mental health, such as anxiety, depression and sleeping disturbances. Internet abuse and the consequent overexposure to rapidly spreading misinformation (infodemia) are associated to anxiety and depression.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryan Adrian Garcia-Priego","author_inst":"Medical Biological Research Institute , Universidad Veracruzana"},{"author_name":"Arturo Triana-Romero","author_inst":"Medical Biological Research Institute, Universidad Veracruzana"},{"author_name":"Samanta Mayanini Pinto-Galvez","author_inst":"Medical Biological Research Institute, Universidad Veracruzana"},{"author_name":"Cristina Duran-Ramos","author_inst":"Medical Biological Research Institue, Universidad Veracruzana"},{"author_name":"Omar Salas-Nolasco","author_inst":"Hospital Naval de Especialidades de Veracruz, Secretaria de Marina.

However, several critical hurdles have impeded the development of robust AI model, which include deficiency, isolation, and heterogeneity of CT data generated from diverse institutions. These bring about lack of generalization of AI model and therefore prevent it from applications in clinical practices. To overcome this, we proposed a federated learning-based Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI, http:\/\/www.ai-ct-covid.team\/), a decentralized architecture where the AI model is distributed to and executed at each host institution with the data sources or client ends for training and inferencing without sharing individual patient data. Specifically, we firstly developed an initial AI CT model based on data collected from three Tongji hospitals in Wuhan. After model evaluation, we found that the initial model can identify COVID from Tongji CT test data at near radiologist-level (97.5% sensitivity) but performed worse when it was tested on COVID cases from Wuhan Union Hospital (72% sensitivity), indicating a lack of model generalization. Next, we used the publicly available UCADI framework to build a federated model which integrated COVID CT cases from the Tongji hospitals and Wuhan Union hospital (WU) without transferring the WU data. The federated model not only performed similarly on Tongji test data but improved the detection sensitivity (98%) on WU test cases. The UCADI framework will allow participants worldwide to use and contribute to the model, to deliver a real-world, globally built and validated clinic CT-COVID AI tool. This effort directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals' number 3, Good Health and Well-Being, and allows sharing and transferring of knowledge to fight this devastating disease around the world.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongchao Xu","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liya Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Information Management, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Ke Ma","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jiehua Yang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Yang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yaobing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Shu","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Ziwei Fan","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jiefeng Gan","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyu Zou","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Renhao Huang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Changzheng Zhang","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Liu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Methods 231 nurse practitioners were enrolled who worked in isolation region in designated hospitals to admit patients with COVID-19 in China. Demographic data, goggle-associated symptoms and underlying reasons, incidence of medical errors or exposures, the effects of fog in goggles on practice were all collected. Data were stratified and analyzed by age or working experience. Risk factors of goggle-associated medical errors were analyzed by multivariable logistical regression analysis. Findings Goggle-associated symptoms and foggy goggles widely presented in nurses. The most common symptoms were headache, skin pressure injury and dizziness. Headache, vomit and nausea were significantly fewer reported in nurses with longer working experience while rash occurred higher in this group. The underlying reasons included tightness of goggles, unsuitable design and uncomfortable materials. The working status of nurses with more working experience was less impacted by goggles. 11.3% nurses occurred medical exposures in clinical practice while 19.5% nurses made medical errors on patients. The risk factors for medical errors were time interval before adapting to goggle-associated discomforts, adjusting goggles and headache. Interpretation Goggle-associated symptoms and fog can highly impact the working status and contribute to medical errors during management of COVID-19. Increased the experience with working in PPE through adequate training and psychological education may benefit for relieving some symptoms and improving working status. Improvement of goggle design during productive process was strongly suggested to reduce incidence of discomforts and medical errors.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao-huan He","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Yan-ru Feng","author_inst":"Xi Kang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gao-ming Li","author_inst":"Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jiao Pang","author_inst":"Air Force Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ting Chen","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ya-li Zhou","author_inst":"San Ai Tang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Armed Police Force Hospital of Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Jing Lang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Li-min Li","author_inst":"Characteristic Medical Center of the Chinese people's Armed Police Force"},{"author_name":"Li Feng","author_inst":"Special Service Sanatorium Center of the Chinese people's Armed Police Force"},{"author_name":"Xin He","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Hongming Miao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Yong-hua Wang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.

Given that Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) are known to be activated during and participate in inflammatory processes, we examined whether HERV dysregulation signatures are present in COVID-19 patients. Results: By comparing transcriptomes of Peripheral Blood Monocytes (PBMCs) and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) from patients and normal controls we have shown that HERVs are intensely dysregulated in BALF, but not in PBMCs. In particular, upregulation in the expression of multiple HERV families was detected in BALF samples of COVID-19 patients, with HERV-W being the most highly upregulated family among the families analysed. In addition, we compared the expression of HERVs in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBECs) without and after senescence induction in an oncogene-induced senescence model, in order to quantitatively measure changes in the expression of HERVs in bronchial cells during the processes of cellular senescence. Conclusions: This apparent difference of HERV dysregulation between PBMCs and BALF warrants further studies in involvement of HERVs in inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms as well as exploration of HERVs as potential biomarkers for disease progression.

Although official data show that the number of newly infected is declining, it is still unknown what proportion of the population has been affected by the disease. AIM To examine seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in industry workers population sample. METHODS From 23 to 28 April 2020, we conducted serological testing for antibodies (IgG and IgM) on 1494 factory employees living in the Split-Dalmatia and Sibenik-Knin County (Croatia). We analysed antibody seroprevalence on the level of the company, county, and separately for employees living at the factory premises with limited mobility during the lockdown measures. RESULTS In a total sample of tested company employees, we detected antibodies in 1.27% of participants (95% CI 0.77-1.98%). In Split facility 13\/1316 (0.99%, 95% CI 0.53-1.68%) of participants were tested positive, of which 13\/1079 (1.20%, 95% CI 0.64-2.05%) of those living outside the facility and 0\/237 (0%, 95% CI 0-1.26%) of those living inside the facility. In Knin facility, 6\/178 (3.37%, 95% CI 1.25-7.19%) participants were tested positive for antibodies. The difference between Split (no mobility restrictions) and Knin, was not statistically significant ({chi}2 = 3.47, P = 0.062). CONCLUSIONS The study showed relatively small SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in the DIV Group population sample. When the study findings are interpreted on the county levels, they could indicate that most of the counties' population was not exposed to the virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan Jerkovic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences University of Split"},{"author_name":"Toni Ljubic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences University of Split"},{"author_name":"Zeljana Basic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ivana Kruzic","author_inst":"University Deparment ofForensic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nenad Kunac","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Josko Bezic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Arijana Vuko","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Dr. Fran Mihaljevic University Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia; Catholic University of Croatia, Zagreb, Croatia; University of Rijeka School o"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split, Split, Croatia; University of Split, School of Medicine, Sp"},{"author_name":"Vassilis Gorgoulis","author_inst":"Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vana Spoulou","author_inst":"Immunobiology and Vaccine Research Laboratory, First Department of Peadiatrics, Aghia Sophia Childrens Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian U"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, MedicalSchool, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Pagona Lagiou","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Gkikas Magiorkinis","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Dandan Tu","author_inst":"HUST-HW Joint Innovation Lab"},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dehua Yang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Ming-Wei Wang","author_inst":"The National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Xie","author_inst":"CalmCar Vision System Ltd., Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxiang Leng","author_inst":"SAIC Advanced Technology Department, SAIC, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Nagaraj Holalkere","author_inst":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology, Radiology for Quality and Operations, The CardioVascular Center at Tufts Medical Center, Radiology, Tufts Universit"},{"author_name":"Neil J.
