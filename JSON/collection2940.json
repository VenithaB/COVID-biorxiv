This study aimed to (i) evaluate the changes (pre-versus during pandemic) in time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in selfisolating Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) to explore correlates of MVPA and SB. Methods: A cross-sectional self-report online survey, evaluating the time spent in MVPA and SB pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, variables, and time in self-isolation were also obtained. Changes in MVPA and SB and their correlates were explored using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: A total of 877 participants (72.7% women, 53.7% young adults [18-34 years]) were included. Overall, participants reported a 59.7% reduction (95%CI:35.6 to 82.2) in time spent on MVPA during the pandemic. Time spent in SB increased 42.0% (95%CI:31.7 to 52.5). Greater reductions in MVPA and\/or increases in SB were seen in younger adults, those not married, those employed and those with a self-reported previous diagnosis of a mental disorder. Conclusions: People in self-isolation significantly reduced MVPA levels and increased SB. Public health strategies should be implemented during epidemic times to mitigate the impact of self-isolation on MVPA and SB, particularly in vulnerable groups.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe Schuch","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Rugero Bulzing","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Jacob Meyer","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Lopez-Sanchez","author_inst":"University of Murcia"},{"author_name":"Igor Grabovac","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Peter Willeit","author_inst":"University of Innsbruck"},{"author_name":"Davy Vancampfort","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Cristina Caperchione","author_inst":"University of Technology Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kabir Sadarangani","author_inst":"Universidade Autonoma de Chile"},{"author_name":"Andre Werneck","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Philip Ward","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Mark Tully","author_inst":"Ulster University"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"Anglia Ruskin University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sports medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.14.20153981","rel_title":"Cell-based culture of SARS-CoV-2 informs infectivity and safe de-isolation assessments during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.14.20153981","rel_abs":"Background The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples collected from persons recovered from COVID-19 does not necessarily indicate shedding of infective virions. By contrast, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using cell-based culture likely indicates infectivity, but there are limited data on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR. Here we review our experience using SARS-CoV-2 culture to determine infectivity and safe de-isolation of COVID-19 patients. Methods 195 patients with diverse severity of COVID-19 were tested (outpatients [n=178]), inpatients [n=12] and ICU [n=5]). SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were cultured in Vero C1008 cells and inspected daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE was confirmed by PCR of culture supernatant. Where no CPE was documented, PCR was performed on day four to confirm absence of virus replication. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of the day four PCR (Ctculture) and the PCR of the original clinical sample (Ctsample) were compared, and positive cultures were defined as a Ctsample - Ctculture value of greater than or equal to 3. Findings Of 234 samples collected, 228 (97%) were from the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 was only successfully isolated from samples with Ctsample values <32, including in 28\/181 (15%), 19\/42 (45%) and 9\/11 samples (82%) collected from outpatients, inpatients and ICU patients, respectively. The mean duration from symptom onset to culture positivity was 4.5 days (range 0-18 days). SARS-CoV-2 was significantly more likely to be isolated from samples collected from inpatients (p<0.001) and ICU patients (p<0001) compared with outpatients, and in samples with lower Ctsample values. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 culture may be used as a surrogate marker for infectivity and inform de-isolation protocols.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kerri Basile","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Kenneth McPhie","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Ian Carter","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Susan Alderson","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Hossinur Rahman","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Linda Donovan","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Shanil Kumar","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Tyna Tran","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Danny Ko","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Tharshini Sivaruban","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Christine Ngo","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Cheryl Toi","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Matthew V O'Sullivan","author_inst":"CIDMLS-ICPMR, CIDM-PH, Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Vitali Sintchenko","author_inst":"CIDMLS-ICPMR, CIDM-PH, Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Sharon C-A Chen","author_inst":"CIDMLS-ICPMR, CIDM-PH, Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Susan Maddocks","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Laboratory Services, NSW Health Pathology - Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead NSW 2"},{"author_name":"Dominic E Dwyer","author_inst":"CIDMLS-ICPMR, CIDM-PH, Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Jen Kok","author_inst":"CIDMLS-ICPMR, CIDM-PH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154310","rel_title":"Observational Study of Chlorpromazine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154310","rel_abs":"On the grounds of its anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects, chlorpromazine has been suggested to be effective treatment for Covid-19. We examined the association between chlorpromazine use and respiratory failure among all hospitalized adults with Covid-19 at the 39 Greater Paris University hospitals since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis adjusting for numerous potential confounders. We used a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Of the 12,217 adult inpatients with a positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test included in the analyses, 57 (0.47%) received chlorpromazine. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint occurred in 29 patients (50.9%) exposed to chlorpromazine and 1,899 patients (15.6%) who were not. In the main analysis, there was a positive significant association between chlorpromazine use and the outcome (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.56, p=0.019), while a Cox regression in a matched analytic sample yielded non-significant association (1.38; 95% CI, 0.91 to 2.09, p=0.123).

Critical unanswered questions remain about the timing of relaxation, and if and how unregulated social distancing measures can be sustained while effectively maintaining epidemic control. Methods: We identified all statewide social distancing measures that were implemented and\/or relaxed in the U.S. between March 10-July 15, 2020, triangulating data from state government and third-party sources. Using segmented linear regression, we evaluated the extent to which social distancing measure relaxation affected epidemic control, as indicated by the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (R[t]). Results: In the eight weeks prior to relaxation, mean R[t] declined by 0.012 units per day (95% CI, -0.013 to -0.012), and 46\/51 jurisdictions achieved R[t] < 1.0 by the date of relaxation. After relaxation of social distancing, R[t] reversed course and began increasing by 0.007 units per day (95% CI, 0.006-0.007), reaching a mean R[t] of 1.16 eight weeks later, with only 9\/51 jurisdictions maintaining R[t] <1.0. Indicators often used to motivate relaxation at the time of relaxation (e.g. test positivity rate <5%) predicted greater post-relaxation epidemic growth. Conclusions: We detected an immediate and significant reversal in epidemic growth gains after relaxation of social distancing measures across the U.S. These results illustrate the potential pitfalls of premature relaxation of social distancing measures in the U.S.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander C Tsai","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guy Harling","author_inst":"University College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Zahra C Reynolds","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rebecca F Gilbert","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark J Siedner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlos Blanco","author_inst":"NIDA"},{"author_name":"Cedric Lemogne","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Airagnes","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Paris","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christel Daniel","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Gramfort","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Lemaitre","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Melodie Bernaux","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Ali Bellamine","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nathanael Beeker","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Frederic Limosin","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Dominic E Dwyer","author_inst":"CIDMLS-ICPMR, CIDM-PH, Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Jen Kok","author_inst":"CIDMLS-ICPMR, CIDM-PH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154401","rel_title":"Immuno-epidemiological life-history and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over the next five years","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154401","rel_abs":"Uncertainty in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may have implications for future outbreaks.

be a possible risk factor for COVID-19 disease in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the causality as well as the role of body fat distribution in this context still unclear. Thus, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated the causal impact of obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Methods Obesity was quantified by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these anthropometric measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium (Locke et al. (n=322154); Shungin et al. (n=232101)) and for the COVID-19 susceptibility (n=1079768) as well as hospitalization (n = 900687) from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Causal estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques. Results Genetically predicted BMI was significantly associated (per one SD) with both, COVID-19 susceptibility (OR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.72; P-value=0.001) and hospitalization (OR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.19 - 2.14; P-value=0.006). WC was associated with the susceptibility (OR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.78; P-value=0.015) but not with hospitalization. WHR was not associated with any of the COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions This study provides evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a risk group. Future research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking obesity with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dennis Freuer","author_inst":"1:\tChair of

We found a 5.3% case fatality rate of the ICU patients in Chongqing. 93% patients developed ARDS during the intensive care, and more than half were moderate. However, most of the patients (55%) supported with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy, but not mechanical ventilation. Nearly one third of patients with ARDS got an early improvement (eiARDS), and the rate is much higher than the other causes of ARDS in a previous study. Patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and lower length of ICU stay. The age (< 55 years) is an independent predictor for the eiARDS, and stratification of COVID-19 patients by age is recommended.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhu

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in admissions with cardiovascular (CV) emergencies. The fatal consequences of this are unknown. Objectives - To describe the place and causes of acute CV death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design - Retrospective nationwide cohort. Setting - England and Wales. Participants - All adult (age [&ge;]18 years) acute CV deaths (n=580,972) between 1st January 2014 and 2nd June 2020. Exposure - The COVID-19 pandemic (defined as from the onset of the first COVID-19 death in England on 2nd March 2020). Main outcomes - Place (hospital, care home, home) and acute CV events directly contributing to death as stated on the first part of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Results - After 2nd March 2020, there were 22,820 acute CV deaths of which 5.7% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute CV mortality of 1752 (+8%) compared with the expected daily deaths in the same period. Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Care homes had the greatest increase in excess acute CV deaths (1065, +40%), followed by deaths at home (1728, +34%) and in hospital (57, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute CV death during this period was stroke (8,290, 36.3%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (5,532, 24.2%), heart failure (5,280, 23.1%), pulmonary embolism (2,067, 9.1%) and cardiac arrest (1,037, 4.5%). Deep vein thrombosis had the greatest increase in cause of excess acute CV death (18, +25%), followed pulmonary embolism (340, +19%) and stroke (782, +10%). The greatest cause of excess CV death in care homes was stroke (700, +48%), compared with cardiac arrest (80, +56%) at home, and pulmonary embolism (126, +14%) and cardiogenic shock (41, +14%) in hospital. Conclusions and relevance - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute CV deaths above that expected for the time of year, nearly half of which occurred in the community. The most common cause of acute CV death was stroke followed by acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. This is key information to optimise messaging to the public and enable health resource planning.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Mohamed","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Chun Shing Kwok","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Chris Roebuck","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"ONS"},{"author_name":"Tom Denwood","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Tom Luescher","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Mark De Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"John Deanfield","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Chris Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Elias T Friman","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Toby Hurd","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Edward J Jarman","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Frederic Lee Mow Chee","author_inst":"Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline K Rainger","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Marion Walker","author_inst":"Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Camilla Drake","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Dasa Longman","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Mordstein","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sophie J Warlow","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Stewart McKay","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Louise Slater","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Morad Ansari","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Ian PM Tomlinson","author_inst":"Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.14.20153858","rel_title":"Community-level SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey in urban slum dwellers of Buenos Aires City, Argentina: a participatory research.","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.14.20153858","rel_abs":"Background By July 1st, the incidence rate of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.9% in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City. This study aimed to establish the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 three months after the first case was reported. Methods Between June 10th and July 1st, a cross-sectional design was carried out on people over 14 years old, selected from a probabilistic sample of households. A finger prick sample was tested by ELISA to detect IgG-class antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Multilevel model was applied to understand sector, household and individual conditions associated with seroconvert. Results Prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95%IC 52.8% to 54.1%). Among the IgG positive cases, 15% reported having compatible symptoms at some point in the past two months. There is evidence of within-household clustering effect (rho=0.52; 95% IC 0.36-0.67); living with a PCR-confirmed case doubled the chance of being SARS-CoV2 IgG positive (OR 2.13; 95% IC 1.17-3.85). The highest risk of infection was found in one of the most deprived areas of the slum, the Bajo autopista sector. Discussion High seroprevalence is shown, for each symptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed diagnosis, 9 people were IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probable asymptomatic) infections. Given that transmission among family members is a leading driver of the disease`s spread, it is unsurprising that crowded housing situations in slums are directly associated with higher risk of infection and consequently high seroprevalence levels. This study contributes to the understanding of population immunity against SARS-CoV2, its relation to living conditions and viral spread, for future decision making.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvana Figar","author_inst":"Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Vanina Pagotto","author_inst":"Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Lorena Luna","author_inst":"Salud Comunitaria, Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Julieta Salto","author_inst":"Salud Comunitaria, Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Wagner Manslau","author_inst":"Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Mistchenko","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia, Hospital de Ni\u00f1os Dr R.

We have created a Shiny\/R web application with user-selectable features: open data sources with daily COVID-19 incidences from all countries and many regions, customizable preprocessing options (smoothing, proportional increment, backwards distribution of negative corrections, etc), different MonteCarlo-Markov-Chain estimates of the generation time or serial interval distributions and state-of-the-art Rt estimation frameworks (EpiEstim, R0). We have analyzed the impact of these factors in the obtained transmission curves. We also have obtained curves at the national and sub-national level and analyzed the impact of epidemic control strategies, superspreading events, socioeconomic factors and outbreaks. We conclude that country wealth and, to a lesser extent, mitigation strategies, were associated with poorer epidemic control. Dataset quality was an important factor, and sometimes dictated the necessity of time series smoothing. We couldn't find conclusive evidence regarding the impact of alleged superspreading events. In the reopening phase, outbreaks had an impact on transmission curves. This application could be used interactively as a tool both to obtain transmission estimates and to perform interactive sensitivity analysis.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Alfredo Bautista Balb\u00e1s","author_inst":"Hospital Virgen de la Poveda"},{"author_name":"Mario Gil Conesa","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundaci\u00f3n Alcorc\u00f3n"},{"author_name":"Gil Rodr\u00edguez Caravaca","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundaci\u00f3n Alcorc\u00f3n"},{"author_name":"Blanca Bautista Balb\u00e1s","author_inst":"Hospital Can Mises"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Wagner Manslau","author_inst":"Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Mistchenko","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia, Hospital de Ni\u00f1os Dr R.

44.5 [14.8] y), [&ge;] 18 y who were residing in the surveyed countries Main outcome measures: Stages of Change scale for exercise behaviour change, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short-form), World Health Organisation-5 Well-being Index and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9 Results: Participants who reported a negative change in exercise behaviour between pre- and during the early COVID-19 restrictions demonstrated poorer mental health and well-being compared to those who had either a positive change- or no change in their exercise behaviour (p<0.001). Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p<0.001). Individuals who engaged in more physical activity reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Although there were no differences in physical activity between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon the physical activity habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations. Public health interventions that encourage physical activity should target specific groups (e.g., men, young adults) who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of physical distancing and\/or self-isolation.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Faulkner","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Wendy O'Brien","author_inst":"Massey University"},{"author_name":"Bronagh McGrane","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wadsworth","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"John Batten","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Askew","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Claire Badenhorst","author_inst":"Massey University"},{"author_name":"Erin Byrd","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Maura Coulter","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Nick Draper","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Catherine Elliot","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"Simon Fryer","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hamlin","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154815","rel_title":"The utility of established prognostic scores in COVID-19 hospital admissions: a multicentre prospective evaluation of CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154815","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing yet, due to the lack of a COVID-19 specific tool, clinicians must use pre-existing illness severity scores for initial prognostication. However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS The North West Collaborative Organization for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR) performed a multi-centre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a two-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to hospital were recorded, including the CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across 7 hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in ICU. All scores underestimated mortality compared to their original validation in non-COVID-19 populations, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low risk' categories (CURB-65<2, NEWS2<5, qSOFA<2) 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION All existing prognostic scores evaluated here underestimated adverse outcomes and performed sub-optimally in the COVID-19 setting. New prognostic tools including a focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse are needed. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Freddy Frost","author_inst":"Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Patrick Bradley","author_inst":"Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kukatharmini Tharmaratnam","author_inst":"Department of Health Data Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR)","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dan Gower Wootton","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Askew","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Claire Badenhorst","author_inst":"Massey University"},{"author_name":"Erin Byrd","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Maura Coulter","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Nick Draper","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Catherine Elliot","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"Simon Fryer","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hamlin","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154146","rel_title":"Seasonality of non-SARS, non-MERS Corona viruses and the impact of meteorological factors","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154146","rel_abs":"Background: Seasonality is a characteristic of some respiratory viruses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the seasonality and the potential effects of different meteorological factors on the detection rate of the non-SARS Corona Virus detection by PCR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 12763 respiratory tract sample results (288 positive and 12475 negative) for non-SARS, non-MERS Corona viruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1). The effect of seven single weather factors on the Corona virus detection rate was fitted in a logistic regression model with and without adjusting for other weather factors. Results: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern peaking from December to March and plunging from July to September. The seasonal effect was less pronounced in immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent. Different automatic variable selection processes agreed to select the predictors temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover and precipitation as remaining predictors in the multivariable logistic regression model including all weather factors, with low ambient temperature, low relative humidity, high cloud cover and high precipitation being linked to increased Corona virus detection rates. Conclusions: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern, which was more pronounced in immunocompetent patients compared to immunosuppressed. Several meteorological factors were associated with the Corona virus detection rate. However, when mutually adjusting for all weather factors, only temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and cloud cover contributed independently to predicting the Corona virus detection rate.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olympia E Anastasiou","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anika Huesing","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Korth","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fotis Theodoropoulos","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, University Hospital of Essen - Ruhrlandklinik, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Taube","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, University Hospital of Essen - Ruhrlandklinik, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Karl-Heinz Joeckel","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Studies (ZKSE), Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical Faculty, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maura Coulter","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Nick Draper","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Catherine Elliot","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"Simon Fryer","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hamlin","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20151985","rel_title":"Size Dependent Particle Removal Efficiency and Pressure Drop of a Dust Cleaning Material For Use as Facemask Filters for Protection during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20151985","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe demand for facemasks, and this has resulted in the use of those made from alternate media.

Hence an objective severity assessment is crucial in making therapeutic decisions judiciously. Computed Tomography (CT)-scans can provide demarcating features to identify the severity of pneumonia, commonly associated with COVID-19, in the affected lungs. Here, a semi-quantitative severity assessing lung CT image feature is demonstrated for COVID-19 patients. An open-source multi-center Italian database was used, among which 61 cases were incorporated in the study (age 27-86, 71% males) from 27 CT imaging centers. Lesions in the form of opacifications, crazy-paving patterns, and consolidations were heuristically marked and the severity determining feature L_norm was quantified and established to be statistically distinct for the three classes i.e., mild, moderate, and severe (p-value < 0.0001). The thresholds of L_norm for a 3-class classification were determined based on the optimum sensitivity\/specificity combination from ROC analyses. The feature L_norm classified the cases in the three severity categories with 89.34% accuracy when L_norm was calculated based on experts' heuristic annotations. Substantial to almost-perfect intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were achieved involving expert and non-expert based evaluations ({kappa}-score 0.79-0.97). We trained machine learning based classification models and showed L_norm alone has a superior diagnostic accuracy over standard image intensity and texture features. Classification accuracy was further increased when L_norm was used to delineate the severe cases from non-severe ones (98.9%) with high sensitivity (97.7%), and specificity (97.49%). Therefore, key highlights of this severity assessment feature are accuracy, lower dependency on expert availability, and wide utility across multiple imaging centers.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biswajoy Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Kumar","author_inst":"Bengal School of Technology, West Bengal"},{"author_name":"Anup K Sadhu","author_inst":"EKO CT and MRI Scan Centre, Medical College and Hospitals Campus, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Nirmalya Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagur"},{"author_name":"Pabitra Mitra","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagur"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmoy Chatterjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagur"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maura Coulter","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Nick Draper","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Catherine Elliot","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"Simon Fryer","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hamlin","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20153130","rel_title":"Asthma in COVID-19: An extra chain fitting around the neck?","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20153130","rel_abs":"Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources. The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% vs 54.2%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3% vs 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1{+\/-}12.5 vs 11.5{+\/-}10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Hosny Hussein","author_inst":"Division of Endocrine and Oncologic Surgery, Department of Surgery,

Methods Retrospective dataset of all 73 patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to a sentinel practice in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein, Austria, between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. We split the outbreak in two halves, by dividing the period from the first to the last case by two, to characterise the following three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: people with reactive RT-PCR presenting during the first half (early acute infection) vs. those presenting in the second half (late acute), and people with non-reactive RT-PCR (late convalescent). For each cohort we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-PCR and the duration of symptoms. We also report multivariate regression of 15 clinical symptoms as covariates, comparing all people with convalescent infection to those with acute infection. Findings All 73 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7 presenting late acute and 7 late convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2 negative, and 7 were excluded. RT-PCR sensitivity was high (100%) among acute presenters, but dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak; specificity was 100%. The mean duration of symptoms was 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, and 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8 days (2-12) among late convalescent presenters respectively. Convalescent infection was only associated with loss of taste (ORs=6.02;p=0.047). Acute infection was associated with loss of taste (OR=571.72;p=0.029), nausea and vomiting (OR=370.11;p=0.018), breathlessness (OR=134.46;p=0.049), and myalgia (OR=121.82;p=0.032); but not loss of smell, fever or cough. Interpretation RT-PCR rapidly and reliably detects early COVID-19 among people presenting with viral illness and multiple symptoms in primary care, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak. RT-PCR testing in primary care should be prioritised for effective COVID-19 prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Werner Leber","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Lammel","author_inst":"Practice Dr. Lammel, Ramsau am Dachstein, Austria"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Maria Elisabeth Mustafa-Korninger","author_inst":"Medizinisch-chemisches Labor Dr. Mustafa, Dr. Richter OG, Salzburg, Austria"},{"author_name":"Karin Stiasny","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Reingard Christina Glehr","author_inst":"Institute of General Practice and Evidence-based Health Services Research, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria"},{"author_name":"Eva-Maria Hochstrasser","author_inst":"Practice Dr. Lammel, Ramsau am Dachstein, Austria"},{"author_name":"Christian Hoellinger","author_inst":"Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siebenhofer","author_inst":"Institute of General Practice and Evidence-based Health Services Research, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria and Institute of General Practice, Goethe-U"},{"author_name":"Chris Griffiths","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Juan Duchesne","author_inst":"Trauma\/Acute Care and Critical Care, Department of Surgery, Tulane, Tulane School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA"},{"author_name":"Emad Kandil","author_inst":"Division of Endocrine and Oncologic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Tulane University, School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, USA"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20153064","rel_title":"Differences by country-level income in COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, and rates per million population in the first five months of the pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20153064","rel_abs":"Abstract Objective: To describe differences by country-level income in COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, incidence rates, and death rates per million population.

However, there has been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting brain pathology. Methods We studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices. Results We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6\/14, 43%) than patients without epileptiform findings (2\/23, 9%; p=0.042). There were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2. Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, and patients recently sedated were more likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm (p=0.022). Conclusions Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather may also reflect patients' broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neishay Ayub","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joseph Cohen","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin Jing","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aayushee Jain","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ryan Tesh","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shibani S.

When we explore the different policy approaches adopted as well as the underlying socio-economic factors, we note an interesting set of correlations: countries led by women leaders have fared significantly better than those led by men on a wide range of dimensions concerning the global health crisis. In this paper, we analyze available data for 35 countries, focusing on the following variables: number of deaths per capita due to COVID-19, number of days with reported deaths, peaks in daily deaths, deaths occurred on the first day of lockdown, and excess mortality. Results show that countries governed by female leaders experienced much fewer COVID-19 deaths per capita and were more effective and rapid at flattening the epidemic's curve, with lower peaks in daily deaths. We argue that there are both contingent and structural reasons that may explain these stark differences. First of all, most women-led governments were more prompt at introducing restrictive measures in the initial phase of the epidemic, prioritizing public health over economic concerns, and more successful at eliciting collaboration from the population. Secondly, most countries led by women are also those with a stronger focus on social equality, human needs and generosity. These societies are more receptive to political agendas that place social and environmental wellbeing at the core of national policymaking.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Coscieme","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Fioramonti","author_inst":"Department of Political Sciences, University of Pretoria, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Lars F Mortensen","author_inst":"European Environment Agency, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kate E Pickett","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of York, UK"},{"author_name":"Ida Kubiszewski","author_inst":"Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University Australia"},{"author_name":"Hunter Lovins","author_inst":"Natural Capitalism Solutions Longmont, Colorado, United States"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline McGlade","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Kristin Vala Ragnarsdottir","author_inst":"Institutes of Earth Sciences and Sustainable Development Studies, University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Debra Roberts","author_inst":"Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department, eThekwini Municipality, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Robert Costanza","author_inst":"Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University Australia"},{"author_name":"Roberto De Vogli","author_inst":"Department of Social Psychology and Development, University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Richard Wilkinson","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham UK"},{"author_name":"Emad Kandil","author_inst":"Division of Endocrine and Oncologic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Tulane University, School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, USA"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.201517","rel_title":"Comparative multiplexed interactomics of SARS-CoV-2 and homologous coronavirus non-structural proteins identifies unique and shared host-cell dependencies","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.201517","rel_abs":"Human coronaviruses (hCoV) have become a threat to global health and society, as evident from the SARS outbreak in 2002 caused by SARS-CoV-1 and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, each strain has distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein interactions of two hCoV non-structural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43 - an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologs from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identifiy nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response (UPR) associated proteins, and anti-viral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4 interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from SARS strains. Our mass spectrometry workflow enables rapid and robust comparisons of multiple bait proteins, which can be applied to additional viral proteins. Furthermore, the identified common interactions may present new targets for exploration by host-directed anti-viral therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan P Davies","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Katherine M Almasy","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Eli F McDonald","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Lars Plate","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Ida Kubiszewski","author_inst":"Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University Australia"},{"author_name":"Hunter Lovins","author_inst":"Natural Capitalism Solutions Longmont, Colorado, United States"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline McGlade","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Kristin Vala Ragnarsdottir","author_inst":"Institutes of Earth Sciences and Sustainable Development Studies, University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Debra Roberts","author_inst":"Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department, eThekwini Municipality, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Robert Costanza","author_inst":"Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University Australia"},{"author_name":"Roberto De Vogli","author_inst":"Department of Social Psychology and Development, University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Richard Wilkinson","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham UK"},{"author_name":"Emad Kandil","author_inst":"Division of Endocrine and Oncologic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Tulane University, School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, USA"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20148668","rel_title":"Quantifying the impacts of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19: an empirical analysis from 344 cities of China","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20148668","rel_abs":"Abstract Objective Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), human mobility restriction measures have raised controversies, partly due to inconsistent findings. Empirical study is urgently needed to reliably assess the causal effects of mobility restriction. Methods Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time, after adjusting for confounders. Results The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After four weeks, population mobility declined by 54.81% (interquartile ranges, -65.50% to -43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout six weeks (i.e., 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% (95%CI 0.50% to 0.93%) reduce of cumulative cases for one week, 1.42% two weeks, 1.69% three weeks, 1.72% four weeks,1.64% five weeks and 1.52% six weeks). The impact on weekly new cases seemed greater in the first four weeks, but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. Conclusion Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. However, a change in the degree of mobility restriction may be warranted over time, particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction. Implementation of mobility restrictions in major cities with large population sizes may be even more important.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Tan","author_inst":"Chinese

many countries, but outbreaks persist in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) who are at high risk of severe outcomes. Epidemiological data from LTCFs are scarce. We used population-level active surveillance to estimate incidence of, and risk factors for Covid-19, and attributable mortality in elderly residents of LTCFs. Methods: Cohort study using individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents and daily counts of infection for 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff across 179 UK LTCFs. We modelled risk factors for infection and mortality using Cox proportional hazards and estimated attributable fractions. Findings: 2,075\/9,339 residents developed Covid-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory confirmed infections. Confirmed infection incidence in residents and staff respectively was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days. 121\/179 (67.6%) LTCFs had at least one Covid-19 infection or death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 1,694 all-cause deaths occurred in 8,713 (19.4% [18.6%; 20.3%]) residents. 217 deaths occurred in 607 residents with confirmed infection (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). 567\/1694 (33.5%) of all-cause deaths were attributable to Covid-19, 28.0% of which occurred in residents with laboratory-confirmed infection. The remainder of excess deaths occurred in asymptomatic or symptomatic residents in the context of limited testing for infection, suggesting substantial under-ascertainment. Interpretation: 1 in 5 residents had symptoms of infection during the pandemic, but many cases were not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels increase infection risk. Disease control measures should integrate active surveillance and testing with fundamental changes in staffing and care home occupancy to protect staff and residents from infection.

However, quantitative information on the relative importance of specific transmission pathways of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (i.e., droplets, aerosols, and fomites across short- and long-range distances) remains limited. Methods To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We developed a framework that combines stochastic Markov chain and negative exponential dose-response modeling with available empirical data on mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and human behaviors, which informs a modified version of the Reed-Frost epidemic model to predict daily and cumulative daily case counts on the ship. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors, including the magnitude of droplet and aerosol emissions from infected individuals, the infectious dose for deposition of droplets and aerosols to the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and others. Findings A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R2 > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R2 > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations yields insights into the likely values for uncertain parameters and quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases aboard the ship across the entire simulation time period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of large respiratory droplets and small respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%. Short-range transmission was the dominant mode after passenger quarantine began, albeit due primarily to aerosol transmission, not droplets. Interpretation Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions. Although cruise ships represent unique built environments with high ventilation rates and no air recirculation, these findings underscore the importance of implementing public health measures that target the control of inhalation of aerosols in addition to ongoing measures targeting control of large droplet and fomite transmission, not only aboard cruise ships but in other indoor environments as well.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Parham Azimi","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design Prospective study at the Antoine Beclere Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample. Results A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever, myalgia and anosmia, was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions Three weeks after the end of lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic in order to adapt public health measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as social distancing and teleworking for this specific population.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremie Mattern","author_inst":"Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Christelle Vauloup-Fellous","author_inst":"Division of Virology, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, INSERM U1193 Villejuif, France"},{"author_name":"Hoda Zakaria","author_inst":"Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Benachi","author_inst":"Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Julie Carrara","author_inst":"Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Letourneau","author_inst":"Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Nadege Bourgeois-Nicolaos","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Daniele De Luca","author_inst":"Division of Pediatrics and Neonatal Critical Care, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Florence Doucet-Populaire","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Paris Saclay University, AP-HP, Clamart, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandre J.

Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. An online survey was used that targeted people aged 18 and above and residing in Jordan. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, male gender, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety and lower knowledge about the disease. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malik Sallam","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Deema Dababseh","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Alaa Yaseen","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Ayat Al-Haidar","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Duaa Taim","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Huda Eid","author_inst":"University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Nidaa A.
