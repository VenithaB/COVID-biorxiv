Towards this objective, we study and analyze the temporal growth pattern of COVID-19 infection and death counts in various states of India. Our analysis up to August 4, 2020, shows that several states (namely Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal) have reached t2 power-law growth, while Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh exhibit linear growth. Delhi has reached {surd}t phase and may flatten in the coming days. However, some states have deviated from the universal pattern of the epidemic curve. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan show a gradual rise in the power-law regime, which is not the usual trend. Also, Bihar, Karnataka, and Kerala are exhibiting a second wave. In addition, we report that initially, the death counts show similar behavior as the infection counts. Later, however, the death growth rate declines as compared to the infection growth due to better handling of critical cases and increased immunity of the population. These observations indicate that except Delhi, most of the Indian states are far from flattening their epidemic curves.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Asad","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Srivastava","author_inst":"Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Noida"},{"author_name":"Mahendra K.

The rising COVID-19 pandemic caused many governments to impose policies restricting social interactions. These policies have slowed down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the extent that restric- tions can be gradually lifted. Models can be useful to assess the consequences of deconfinement strategies with respect to business, school and leisure activities. Methods. We adapted the individual-based model \"STRIDE\" to simulate interactions between the 11 million inhabitants of Belgium at the levels of households, workplaces, schools and communities. We calibrated our model to observed hospital incidence and seroprevalence data. STRIDE can explore contact tracing options and account for repetitive leisure contacts in extended household settings (so called \"household bubbles\") with varying levels of connectivity. Findings. Household bubbles have the potential to reduce the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions by up to 90%. The effectiveness of contact tracing depends on its timing, as it becomes futile more than 4 days after the index case developed symptoms. Assuming that children have a lower level of susceptibility and lower probability to experience symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, (partial) school closure options have relatively little impact on COVID-19 burden. Interpretation. Not only the absolute number and intensity of physical contacts drive the transmission dynamics and COVID-19 burden, also their repetitiveness is influential. Contact tracing seems essential for a controlled and persistent release of lockdown measures, but requires timely compliance to testing, reporting and self-isolation. Rapid tracing and testing, and communication ensuring continued involvement of the population are therefore essential.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"CHERMID, University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Steven Abrams","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Oana Petrof","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Pietro Coletti","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Elise Kuylen","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Pieter Libin","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Signe Mogelmose","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"James Wambua","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Sereina A Herzog","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"- SIMID COVID19 team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Philippe Beutels","author_inst":"University of Antwerp and University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144295","rel_title":"Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific-antibodies in dried blood spot samples","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144295","rel_abs":"Abstract Importance: Population-wide serological testing is an essential component in understanding the COVID-19 pandemic. The logistical challenges of undertaking widespread serological testing could be eased through use of a reliable dried blood spot (DBS) sampling method. Objective: To validate the use of dried blood spot sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Design, setting and participants: Eighty-seven matched DBS and serum samples were obtained from eighty individuals, including thirty-one who were previously PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. DBS eluates and sera were used in an ELISA to detect antibodies to the viral spike protein. Results: Specific anti-SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies were detectable in both serum and DBS eluate and there was a significant correlation between the antibody levels detected in matched samples (r = 0.96, p<0.0001). Using serum as the gold standard in the assay, matched DBS samples achieved a Cohens kappa coefficient of 0.975 (near-perfect agreement), a sensitivity of 98.1% and specificity of 100%, for detecting anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies. Conclusions and relevance: Eluates from DBS samples are a reliable and reproducible source of antibodies to be used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The use of DBS sampling could complement the use of venepuncture in the immunosurveillance of COVID-19 in both low and high income settings.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriella L Morley","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Stephen Taylor","author_inst":"Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, U.K."},{"author_name":"Sian Jossi","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Marisol Perez-Toledo","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Sian E Faustini","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Edith Marcial-Juarez","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Adrian M Shields","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Margaret Goodall","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Joel D Allen","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Maddy L Newby","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."},{"author_name":"Matthew K O'Shea","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144436","rel_title":"Injury-Prone: Peripheral nerve injuries associated with prone positioning for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144436","rel_abs":"Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require invasive mechanical ventilation frequently meet the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnostic criteria.

However, there remains little knowledge regarding droplet dissemination during airway management procedures in real life settings. Methods: 12 different airway management procedures were investigated during routine clinical care. A high-speed video camera (1000 frames\/second) was for imaging. Quantitative droplet characteristics as size, distance traveled, and velocity were computed. Results: Droplets were detected in 8\/12 procedures. The droplet trajectories could be divided into two distinctive patterns (type 1\/2). Type 1 represented a ballistic trajectory with higher speed droplets whereas type 2 represented a random trajectory of slower particles that persisted longer in air. Speaking and coughing lead to a larger amount of droplets than non-invasive ventilation therapy. The use of tracheal cannula filters reduced the amount of droplets. Conclusions: Respiratory droplet patterns generated during airway management procedures follow two distinctive trajectories based on the influence of aerodynamic forces. Speaking and coughing produce more droplets than non-invasive ventilation therapy confirming these behaviors as exposure risks. Even large droplets may exhibit patterns resembling the fluid dynamics smaller airborne aerosols that follow the airflow convectively and may place the healthcare provider at risk.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarina K Mueller","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Reinhard Veltrup","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Jakubass","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kniesburges","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg Medizinische Fakultat (FAU)"},{"author_name":"Judith Kempfle","author_inst":"Massachusetts Eye Ear, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Matthias J.

However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Mokhlesur Rahman","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"G.

In this cross-sectional study we examined if perceived social support, exercise in minutes per week and change in exercise are protective factors regarding symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleeping disorders. Method: In April 2020, n = 4271 German adults completed an online survey including mental health questionnaires regarding depression (PHQ-D), anxiety (PHQ-D) and sleep (PSQI), as well as questionnaires related to protective factors such as exercise (BSA-F), physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) and social support (F-SozU). Results: Complete case analysis (n = 3700; mean age 33.13 {+\/-} 11.73 years, 78.6 % females) resulted in elevated prevalence of depressive disorder (31.4%), panic disorder (5.7%) and other anxiety disorders (7.4%). 58.3% reported symptoms of insomnia. Three separate models of multiple regression were conducted. Perceived social support was associated with lower values of anxiety (beta = -0.10; t(19) = -6.46; p >0.001), lower values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.22; t(19) = -15.71; p < .001) and lower values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.15; t(19) = -9.55; p < .001). Change towards less exercise compared to the time before Covid-19 was associated with and higher values of anxiety (beta = -0.05; t(19) = -2.85; p= .004), higher values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.08; t(19) = -5.69; p < .001), and higher values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.07; t(19) = -4.54; p < .000). Post-hoc analysis (ANOVAs) revealed that a change towards less exercise was significantly associated with more depressive, anxiety and sleeping disorder symptoms whereas a positive change was not. No significant association was found for exercise in minutes per week for all outcomes. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a negative impact on mental health in the German population. Social Support and a stable amount of exercise might attenuate these negative mental health consequences. Ongoing monitoring of the impact of the pandemic on mental health and possible protective factors is needed in order to create a basis for the development of appropriate prevention and intervention measures.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonie Louisa Bauer","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Britta Seiffer","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Clara Deinhart","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Atrott","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Gorden Sudeck","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Martin Hautzinger","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Inka R\u00f6sel","author_inst":"University Hospital of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Wolf","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Prakash Jayabalan","author_inst":"Shirley Ryan AbilityLab"},{"author_name":"James M.

Methods A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to May 17, 2020 with moderate to severe respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). HFNT patients were divided into two groups: HFNT only and HFNT progressed to IMV. The primary outcome was the ability of the ROX index to predict the need of IMV. Results Of the 837 patients with COVID-19, 129 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.8 ({+\/-}13.6) years, BMI 32.6 ({+\/-}8), 58 (45 %) were female, 72 (55.8%) were African American, 40 (31%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2%) were smokers. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days ({+\/-} 3.3). ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p <0.0001). {Delta}ROX (<=0 versus >0), peak D-dimer >4000 and admission GFR < 60 ml\/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=).

Conclusion ROX index is a valuable, noninvasive tool to evaluate patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 treated with HFNT. ROX helps predicts need for IMV and thus limiting morbidity and mortality associated with IMV.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maulin Patel","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junad Chowdhury","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Mills","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert Marron","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gangemi","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zachariah Dorey-Stein","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ibraheem Yousef","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zheng","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lauren Tragesser","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Julie Giurintano","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rohit Gupta","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Parth Rali","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Zhao","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicole Patlakh","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel Marchetti","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gerard Criner","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Gordon","author_inst":"Temple University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144121","rel_title":"A network-informed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis genes' interactions points to Neutrophil Extracellular Traps as mediators of thrombosis in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144121","rel_abs":"Abnormal coagulation and an increased risk of thrombosis are features of severe COVID-19, with parallels proposed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threating condition associated with hyperinflammation. The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and\/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune\/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Ding","author_inst":"Computational Biology Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 15204"},{"author_name":"David Earl Hostallero","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Mohamed Reda El Khili","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Fonseca","author_inst":"The Meakins-Christie Laboratories at the Research Institute of the McGill University Heath Centre Research Institute, 1001 Boul.

However, data on clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in such settings are scarce. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess clinical characteristics and baseline predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients hospitalized after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a LTCF. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean age was 80 years (SD, 12 years), and 24\/50 (57.1%) patients were males. A total of 42\/50 (84%) patients experienced symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. In Cox regression, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were: hypernatremia (HR 9.12), lymphocyte count <1000 cells\/L (HR 7.45), cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (HR 6.41), and higher levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg\/mL) (HR 1.005). Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Further studies are necessary to better understand and confirm our findings in the setting of a LTCF outbreak of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ENRICO MARIA TRECARICHI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"MARIA MAZZITELLI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCA SERAPIDE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"MARIA CHIARA PELLE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"BRUNO TASSONE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"EUGENIO ARRIGHI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GRAZIELLA PERRI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"PAOLO FUSCO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"VINCENZO SCAGLIONE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CHIARA DAVOLI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"ROSARIA LIONELLO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"VALENTINA LA GAMBA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIUSEPPINA MARRAZZO","author_inst":"MATER DOMINI TEACHING HOSPITAL"},{"author_name":"MARIA TERESA BUSCETI","author_inst":"MATER DOMINI TEACHING HOSPITAL"},{"author_name":"AMERIGO GIUDICE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"MARCO RICCHIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"ANNA CANCELLIERE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"ELENA LIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIADA PROCOPIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCO SAVERIO COSTANZO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"DANIELA FOTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIOVANNI MATERA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CARLO TORTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.20143818","rel_title":"COVID-MATCH65 - A prospectively derived clinical decision rule for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.20143818","rel_abs":"Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increased pressure on testing resources, understanding the clinical and epidemiological features closely associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is vital at point of care to enable risk stratification.

The picture is still not clear because of many limitations including testing tools, time of sampling, and the unclear impact of varying clinical status. In addition to these problems, antibody levels may not be equivalent to protective capacity. Objective: To define the key factor for the different patterns of COVID-19 antibody response. Design: We elucidated the antibody response with time-series throat and serum samples for viral loads and antibody levels, then used a neutralization test to evaluate protectiveness. Setting: A medical center that typically cares for patients with moderate to severe diseases. Because of the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Taiwan and local government policy, however, we also admit COVID-19 patients with mild disease or even those without symptoms for inpatient care. Participants: RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: We found that only patients with relative persistence of virus at pharynx displayed strong antibody responses that were proportional to the pharyngeal viral load. They also had proportional neutralization titers per unit of serum. Although antibody levels decreased around 2 weeks after symptom onset, the neutralization efficacy per unit antibody remained steady and even continued to increase over time. The antibody response in patients with rapid virus clearance was weak, but the neutralization efficacy per unit antibody in these patients was comparable to those with persistent presence of virus. The deceased were with higher viral load, higher level of antibody, and higher neutralization titers in the serum, but the neutralization capacity per unit antibody is relatively low. Conclusions and Relevance: Strong antibody response depends on the relative persistence of the virus, instead of the absolute virus amount. The antibody response is still weak if large amount of virus is cleared quickly. The neutralization efficacy per unit antibody is comparable between high and low antibody patterns. Strong antibody response contains more inefficient and maybe even harmful antibodies. Low antibody response is also equipped with a capable B cell pool of efficient antibodies, which may expand with next virus encounter and confer protection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chung-Guei Huang","author_inst":"1.Dept. of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. 2.Dept. of Med.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a machine learning approach incorporating hidden nonlinear interactions can improve prediction for Intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to public hospitals between 1st January and 24th May 2020 in Hong Kong with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR were included. The primary endpoint was ICU admission. Results: This study included 1043 patients (median age 35 (IQR: 32-37; 54% male). Nineteen patients were admitted to ICU (median hospital length of stay (LOS): 30 days, median ICU LOS: 16 days). ICU patients were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors\/angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir\/ritonavir and remdesivir, ribavirin, steroids, interferon-beta and hydroxychloroquine. Significant predictors of ICU admission were older age, male sex, prior coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and activated partial thromboplastin time, red cell count, white cell count, albumin and serum sodium. A tree-based machine learning model identified most informative characteristics and hidden interactions that can predict ICU admission. These were: low red cells with 1) male, 2) older age, 3) low albumin, 4) low sodium or 5) prolonged APTT. A five-fold cross validation confirms superior performance of this model over baseline models including XGBoost, LightGBM, random forests, and multivariate logistic regression. Conclusions: A machine learning model including baseline risk factors and their hidden interactions can accurately predict ICU admission in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiandong Zhou","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gary Tse","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sharen Lee","author_inst":"Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology"},{"author_name":"Tong Liu","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"William KK Wu","author_inst":"LKS Institute of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"zhidong cao","author_inst":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dajun Zeng","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ian CK Wong","author_inst":"HKU"},{"author_name":"Qingpeng Zhang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Bernard MY Cheung","author_inst":"HKU"},{"author_name":"nasreen Moini","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Sam R Stanley","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Michael T Birrell","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Morgan T Rose","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Claire L Gordon","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Natasha E Holmes","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"ELENA LIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIADA PROCOPIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCO SAVERIO COSTANZO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"DANIELA FOTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIOVANNI MATERA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CARLO TORTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144030","rel_title":"Broad phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions of lymphocytes in COVID-19 recovered individuals","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144030","rel_abs":"Background Lymphopenia is a typical symptom in the COVID-19 patients. While millions of patients are clinical recovered, little is known about the immune status of lymphocytes in these individuals. Methods A clinical recovered cohort (CR) of 55 COVID-19 individuals (discharged from hospital 4 to 11 weeks), and 55 age and sex matched healthy donors cohort (HD) were recruited. Detailed analysis on phenotype of the lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed by flow cytometry. Findings Compared with cohort HD, the CD8+ T cells in cohort CR had higher Teff and Tem, but lower Tc1 (IFN-{gamma}+), Tc2 (IL-4+) and Tc17 (IL-17A+) frequencies. The CD4+ T cells of CR had decreased frequency, especially on the Tcm subset. Moreover, CD4+ T cells of CR expressed lower PD-1 and had lower frequencies of Th1 (IFN-{gamma}+), Th2 (IL-4+), Th17 (IL-17A+) as well as circulating Tfh (CXCR5+PD-1+). Accordingly, isotype-switched memory B cell (IgM-CD20hi) in CR had significantly lower proportion in B cells, though level of activation marker CD71 elevated. For CD3-HLA-DRlo lymphocytes of CR, besides levels of IFN-{gamma}, Granzyme B and T-bet were lower, the correlation between T-bet and IFN-{gamma} became irrelevant. In addition, taken into account of discharged days, all the lowered function associated phenotypes showed no recovery tendency within whole observation period. Interpretation The CR COVID-19 individuals still showed remarkable phenotypic alterations in lymphocytes after clinical recovery 4 to 11 weeks. This suggests SARS-CoV-2 infection imprints profoundly on lymphocytes and results in long-lasting potential dysfunctions.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingyi Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Maohua Zhong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),"},{"author_name":"Ejuan Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Ke Hong","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingyu Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dihan Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Xia","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province"},{"author_name":"Yao-Qing Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mingbo Sun","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bali Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Chaolin Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"You Shang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huimin Yan","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"ELENA LIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIADA PROCOPIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCO SAVERIO COSTANZO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"DANIELA FOTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIOVANNI MATERA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CARLO TORTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20143958","rel_title":"A genome epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into Japan","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20143958","rel_abs":"Background: After the first case of COVID-19 in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple nationwide COVID-19 clusters were identified by the end of February. The Japanese government focused on mitigating emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases appeared until early April, many with unclear infection routes exhibiting no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from COVID-19 cases until early April and characterise the genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan. Methods: Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients and a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected whole genome sequencing and a haplotype network analysis was performed. Findings: Some of the primary clusters identified during January and February in Japan directly descended from Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates in China and other distinct clusters. Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have caused an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread within Japan. National self-restraint during February was effective in mitigating the COVID-19 spread, but late action on stopping immigration and declaring national emergency in Japan might be involved in the later increase in cases. Interpretation: Genome surveillance suggested that at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions from China and other countries occurred.

This study analyses the outbreak and the social-distancing effectiveness timeline in the general population and the care homes. Methods: A novel distributed-compartmental, time-variant epidemiological model was designed specifically for COVID-19 transmission characteristics, featuring a\/pre\/symptomatic transmission, a non-linear hospital model, a weakly-coupled sub-model for the care-home population, and parametrized continuous social-distancing functions. The model parameters and the social-distancing timelines are determined by randomization and Monte-Carlo simulations analysing real-world data. Findings: Despite a high initial reproduction number (3.29) and the near-absence of governmental interventions, the model quantitated that the transmission rate in the general population was suppressed by 73%, and in the care homes by 79%. The measures in the care homes took effect 4.8 days delayed; and if applied 4 or 8 days earlier, the fatalities could have been reduced by 63.2% or 89.9%. The infected population is estimated to 16.2% (June 10). An expected underestimation of population immunity by antibody studies is confirmed. The infection fatality ratio extrapolates to 0.61% (peak: 1.34%). The model indicates a seasonal effect which effectively suppressed a new rise. An analysed large-scale public event had no large influence. The asymptomatic ratio was determined to 35%. Interpretation: The proposed model and methods have proven to analyse a COVID-19 outbreak and to re-construct the social-distancing behaviour with unprecedented accuracy, confirming even minor details indicated by mobility-data analysis, and are applicable to other regions and other emerging infectious diseases of similar transmission characteristics. The self-regulation of the population in Stockholm, influenced by advices by the authorities, was able to suppress a COVID-19 outbreak to a level far beyond that the stringency index of governmental interventions suggests. Proper timing of effective measures in the care homes is important to reduce fatalities.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joachim Oberhammer","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Itokawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Masanori Hashino","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tetsuro Kawano-Sugaya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Rina Tanaka","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Koji Yatsu","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Asami Ohnishi","author_inst":"Sapporo City Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Keiko Goto","author_inst":"Ibaraki Prefectural Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Tsukagoshi","author_inst":"Gunma Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hayato Ehara","author_inst":"Saitama Prefectural Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kenji Sadamasu","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Masakatsu Taira","author_inst":"Division of Virology and Medical Zoology, Chiba Prefectural Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shinichiro Shibata","author_inst":"Microbiology Department, Nagoya City Public Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ryohei Nomoto","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Kobe Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144279","rel_title":"Using the infection fatality rate to predict the evolution of Covid-19 in Brazil","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144279","rel_abs":"In this work we are going to use estimates of Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for Covid-19 in order to predict the evolution of Covid-19 in Brazil.

A national sero-epidemiological survey suggests higher cumulative incidence of infection in older individuals than in younger individuals. However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups, including the relative effect of the lockdown measures introduced on March 15, and strengthened on March 30 to April 14, 2020 when only essential workers continued to work. Methods: We used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE in Spanish) on the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases (by date of symptom onset) in eleven 5-year age groups: 15-19y through 65-69y. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15-69y during the pre-lockdown period (March 1-10, 2020) and the corresponding proportion L(g) during two lockdown periods (March 25-April 3 and April 8-17, 2020). For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g)= L(g)\/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, PR(g1)>PR(g2) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: For the first lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50-54y (PR=1.21; 95% CI: 1.12,1.30) and 55-59y (PR=1.19; 1.11,1.27). For the second lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 15-19y (PR=1.26; 0.95,1.68) and 50-54y (PR=1.20; 1.09,1.31). Conclusions: Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group. During the first lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40-64y, particularly those aged 50-59y presented with higher COVID-19 relative incidence compared to pre-lockdown period, while younger adults\/older adolescents (together with persons aged 50-59y) had increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown. The role of different age groups during the epidemic should be considered when implementing future mitigation efforts.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pablo Martinez de Salazar","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Health professionals, as well as hospital workers, are the most vulnerable population for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 due to their greater proximity to sick patients, especially in specialized hospitals for the treatment of these patients. Study Design: We ran a questionnaire by all the employees of a Public Service Hospital specialised in COVID-19 treatment (1307 employees), in the municipality of Santos, Sao Paulo, Brazil, who presented some symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and positive results by RT-PCR, in Oropharynx Swab collection. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic information, as well as data related to the work areas where they were divided into two groups: Employees at higher risk or those who directly deal with patients (914 employees or 69.9%) and lower risk for employees in the administrative area (393 employees or 30.1%). Results: 211 (16.1%) of the Hospital's employees had to stop their work-related activities due to presenting positive RT-PCR. There were 39 (9.9%) positives in low risk areas and 172 (18.8%) positives in employees in high risk areas. Within the latter group, Nurses, Nursing Assistants and Doctors were the most frequently infected professionals. Regarding the symptoms of professionals positively diagnosed based on RT-PCR, the most frequent symptoms were body pain (83.4%); headache (80.6%); fever (57.8%) and dry cough (53.1%). Conclusion: A high proportion of workers in COVID-19 specialized hospitals was infected by the virus, despite all the protective measures adopted, showing the high transmission capacity of this virus. Stricter individual protection measures among employees must be adopted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MARCOS MONTANI CASEIRO","author_inst":"UNISANTA"},{"author_name":"Monica Mazzurana","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bruno Barreiro","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Estela Capelas Barbosa","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

This report explores low-impact interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 with a minimum of social and economic disruption. Methods An agent-based model simulated the population of King County, Washington, with agents that interact in homes, schools, workplaces, and other community sites. SARS-CoV-2 transmission probabilities were estimated by fitting simulated to observed hospital admissions from February-May 2020. Interventions considered were (a) encouraging telecommuting; (b) reducing contacts to seniors and nursing home residents; (c) modest reductions to contacts outside of the home; (d) encouraging self-isolation of persons with COVID-19 symptoms; (e) rapid testing and household quarantining. Results Individual interventions are not expected to have a large impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations. No intervention reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations by more than 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0% to 13.3%). Removing all interventions would result in nearly 42,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations between June 2020 and January 2021, with peak hospital occupancy exceeding available beds 6-fold. Combining the interventions is predicted to reduce total hospitalizations by 48% (95% CI, 47-49%), with peak COVID-19 hospital occupancy of 70% of total beds. Targeted school closures can further reduce the peak occupancy. Conclusions Combining low-impact interventions may mitigate the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, keeping hospital burden within the capacity of the healthcare system. Under this approach SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the community, moving toward herd immunity, while minimizing social and economic disruption.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"Monica Mazzurana","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bruno Barreiro","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Estela Capelas Barbosa","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

As the disease will likely remain a threat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human demographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate, susceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics will be vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of local epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic, population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking social distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the spread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate of exponential growth (or decay) in cases\/mortality, we find that population-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of growth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and\/or the regional climate conditions in mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to intervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then develop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and local climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the population was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., \"herd immunity\"), while most regions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results will be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can be facilitated using our online dashboard.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niayesh Afshordi","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Holder","author_inst":"Grand Valley State University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Bahrami","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lichtblau","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role. Methods. We apply a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 162 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6049). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable and isolate the mitigating influence of lockdown severity on the association between UVI and growth-rates of COVID-19 deaths from time-constant country-specific and time-varying country-specific potentially confounding factors. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a unit increase in UVI and lockdown severity are independently associated with 17% [-1.8 percentage points] and 77% [-7.9 percentage points] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate, indicating their respective protective roles. However, the widely utilized and least severe lockdown (recommendation to not leave the house) already fully mitigates the protective role of UVI by 95% [1.8 percentage points] indicating its downside. Interpretation: We find that lockdown severity and UVI are independently associated with a slowdown in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. However, we find consistent evidence that increase in lockdown severity is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI in reducing COVID-19 deaths. Our results suggest that lockdowns in conjunction with adequate exposure to UVB radiation might have provided even more substantial health benefits, than lockdowns alone. For example, we estimate that there would be 21% fewer deaths on average with sufficient UVB exposure while people were recommended not to leave their house. Therefore, our study outlines the importance of considering UVB exposure, especially while implementing lockdowns and may support policy decision making in countries imposing such measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lennart Kraft","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Bahrami","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lichtblau","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

The appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 triggered a major global epidemic, which is now a major community health issue. As of April 17, 2020, according to Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh has reported 1838 confirmed cases in between 8 March to 17 April 2020, with > 4.08% of mortality rate and >3.15% of recovery rate. COVID-19 outbreak is evolving so rapidly in Bangladesh; therefore, the availability of epidemiological data and its sensible analysis are essential to direct strategies for situational awareness and intervention. This article presents an exploratory data analysis approach to collect and analyze COVID-19 data on epidemiological outbreaks based on first publicly available COVID-19 Daily Dataset of Bangladesh. Various publicly open data sources on the outbreak of COVID-19 provided by the IEDCR, World Health Organization (WHO), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) of Bangladesh have been used in this research. A Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (V-EDA) techniques have been followed in this research to understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak in different districts of Bangladesh in between 8 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 and these findings were compared with those of other countries. In all, this is extremely important to promptly spread information to understand the risks of this pandemic and begin containment activities in the country.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samrat Kumar Dey","author_inst":"Dhaka International University (DIU)"},{"author_name":"Md.

In all 16 counties, an increase in reported COVID-19 case incidence was observed in all three age groups soon after the governor-ordered Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect. Trends in social mobility, but not trends in testing, correlate with case incidence. Data on hospitalization and mortality do not support the hypothesis that the observed increase in case incidence was merely the result of liberalization of testing criteria. Parameter estimates from a parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model strongly support the hypothesis that younger persons, having first acquired their infections through increasing social contact with their peers, then transmitted their infections to older, less socially mobile individuals.

Even so, underdiagnosis in the country is massive. Nowcasting techniques have helped to overcome the underdiagnosis. Recent advances in machine learning techniques offer opportunities to refine the nowcasting. This study aimed to analyze the underdiagnosis of COVID-19, through nowcasting with machine learning, in a South of Brazil capital. Methods: The study has an observational ecological design. It used data from 3916 notified cases of COVID-19, from April 14th to June 02nd, 2020, in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. We used machine-learning algorithm to classify cases which had no diagnosis yet, producing the nowcast. To analyze the underdiagnosis, we compared the difference between the data without nowcasting and the median of the nowcasted projections for the entire period and for the six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis at the moment of data extraction. Results: The number of new cases throughout the entire period, without nowcasting, was 389. With nowcasting, it was 694 (UI95 496-897,025). At the six days period, the number without nowcasting was 19 and 104 (95% UI 60-142) with. The underdiagnosis was 37.29% in the entire period and 81.73% at the six days period. Conclusions: The underdiagnosis was more critical in six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis before the data collection than in the entire period. The use of nowcasting with machine learning techniques can help to estimate the number of new cases of the disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leandro Pereira Garcia","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Andre Vinicius Goncalves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina and Instituto Federal do Norte de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Matheus Pacheco de Andrade","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Lucas Alexandre Pedebos","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Ana Cristina Vidor","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Roberto Zaina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Graziela de Luca Canto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Vargas Amaral","author_inst":"Universidad de Malaga"},{"author_name":"Neel Gandhi","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shamimul Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Steve Williams","author_inst":"Fulton County Government"},{"author_name":"Fazle Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Sarita Shah","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144188","rel_title":"Differential COVID-19 case positivity in New York City neighborhoods: socioeconomic factors and mobility","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144188","rel_abs":"New York City has been one of the hotspots of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first two months of the outbreak considerable variability in case positivity was observed across the city's ZIP codes. In this study, we examined: a) the extent to which the variability in ZIP code level cases can be explained by aggregate markers of socioeconomic status and daily change in mobility; and b) the extent to which daily change in mobility independently predicts case positivity. Our analysis indicates that the markers considered together explained 56% of the variability in case positivity through April 1 and their explanatory power decreased to 18% by April 30. Our analysis also indicates that changes in mobility during this time period are not likely to be acting as a mediator of the relationship between ZIP-level SES and case positivity. During the middle of April, increases in mobility were independently associated with decreased case positivity. Together, these findings present evidence that heterogeneity in COVID-19 case positivity in New York City is largely driven by neighborhood socioeconomic status.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Raymond Lamb","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sasikiran Kandula","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Lucas Alexandre Pedebos","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Ana Cristina Vidor","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Roberto Zaina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Graziela de Luca Canto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Vargas Amaral","author_inst":"Universidad de Malaga"},{"author_name":"Neel Gandhi","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shamimul Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Steve Williams","author_inst":"Fulton County Government"},{"author_name":"Fazle Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Sarita Shah","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144394","rel_title":"Temporary Immunity and Multiple Waves of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144394","rel_abs":"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe the potential phenomena which may occur if immunity to COVID-19 lasts for a finite time instead of being permanent, i.e. if a recovered COVID-19 patient may again become susceptible to the virus after a given time interval following his\/her recovery. Whether this really happens or not is unknown at the current time. If it does happen, then we find that for certain combinations of parameter values (social mobility, contact tracing, immunity threshold duration etc), the disease can keep recurring in wave after wave of outbreaks, with a periodicity approximately equal to twice the immunity threshold. Such cyclical attacks can be prevented trivially if public health interventions are strong enough to contain the disease outright. Of greater interest is the finding that should such effective interventions not prove possible, then also the second and subsequent waves can be forestalled by a consciously relaxed intervention level which finishes off the first wave before the immunity threshold is breached. Such an approach leads to higher case counts in the immediate term but significantly lower counts in the long term as well as a drastically shortened overall course of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Mohit Manoj Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anoop Misra","author_inst":"Fortis Hospital, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lucas Alexandre Pedebos","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Ana Cristina Vidor","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Roberto Zaina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Graziela de Luca Canto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Vargas Amaral","author_inst":"Universidad de Malaga"},{"author_name":"Neel Gandhi","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shamimul Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Steve Williams","author_inst":"Fulton County Government"},{"author_name":"Fazle Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Sarita Shah","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.20143859","rel_title":"Role of pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.20143859","rel_abs":"Abstract Background Since the start of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019, pharmacists worldwide are playing a key role adopting innovative strategies to minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic. Objectives To identify and describe core services provided by the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. Results A total of 1,189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n=4) and China (n=4). The most common type of publication were letters (n=4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n=8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n=7), through one-to-one contact (n=11), telephone (n=6) or video conference (n=5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n=7) as well as patient counseling (n=8). Conclusions A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and-or other pandemic.

As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood. Here we applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. We found that the basic reproduction number (R0) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands). This study enhances our understanding of the current outbreak and effectiveness of control measures in the UK.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Julian W Tang","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Tommy TY Lam","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lucas Alexandre Pedebos","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Ana Cristina Vidor","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Roberto Zaina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Graziela de Luca Canto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Vargas Amaral","author_inst":"Universidad de Malaga"},{"author_name":"Neel Gandhi","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shamimul Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Steve Williams","author_inst":"Fulton County Government"},{"author_name":"Fazle Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Sarita Shah","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
