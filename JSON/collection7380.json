This model can be used to make predictions of the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in different spatial scales: from a world scale to a country or even a smaller scale. Predictions on persons hospitalized, number of ventilators needed at ICUs and potential numbers of deaths were successfully carried out in different countries using this approach. This paper shows the mathematical basis for the model together with a proposal for its calibration on the different phases of the epidemic. Specific results are shown for the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain. For predicting the evolution of the epidemic four phases were considered: non-controlled evolution since the 20th of February; total lock-down from the 15th of March; partial easing of the lock-down from the 13th of April; and a phased lock-down easing from the 1st of May. In a first phase, if no control is established, the model predicted in Spain 12 millions of infected people of a total of 46.6 millions inhabitants. From those infected nearly 1 million people would need intensive care and around 700,000 deaths would be directly produced by the disease. However, as these numbers would occur in a brief period (few months), the number of deaths would have been higher due to the saturation of the health system. For a second phase, considering a total lock-down of the whole country from the 15th of March, the model predicted for the 17th of April 194,000 symptomatic infected cases, 85,700 hospitalized, nearly 8,600 patients with needs of an ICU and 19,500 deaths. The model also predicted the peak to be produced between the 29th of March and the 3rd of April. Although the data are still under revision, the accuracy in all the predictions was very good, as the reported values by that day were 197,142 infected, 7,548 inpatients needing an ICU and 20,043 deaths. The peak was produced between the 31st of May and the 2nd of April. For the third phase, the ease of the lock-down which began the 13th of April, early predictions were made by the beginning of April [Mora2020c]. Assuming conservatively an infection daily rate of a 3% (r=1.03) the model predicted 400,000 infections and 46,000+\/-15,000 deaths by the end of May. The predictions overestimated the real values, due to a stricter reduction of the infection daily rate which lead to values of r<1% and a revision of the whole series of data by the health authorities carried out along the month of May. A new prediction performed with updated parameters at the beginning of May provided a prediction of 250,000 infected and 29,000+\/-15,000 deaths. The reported values by the end of May were 282,870 infected and 28,552 deaths. After the total easing of the lock-down many uncertainties appear, but the model predicts that the health system would not saturate if the daily rate of infections r is kept below 1.02 (2% of daily increase in the number of symptomatic infected). This simple model provides a system to predict the evolution of epidemics with a good accuracy, even during epidemics development, where other systems have difficulties in their calibration. As the parameters involved in the model are based in empirical values of the different quantities (e.g. number of inpatients or deaths, related with the number of infected persons) it can be dynamically adjusted and adapted to sudden changes in the statistics. As other models, the results provided by this model can be used by the authorities to support decision making in order to optimize resources and to minimize the consequences of epidemics, including the future outbreaks of the COVID-19 which will occur.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan C.

Here, we use deep neural networks over an institution-wide platform for the augmented curation of clinical notes from 77,167 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing. By contrasting Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived symptoms of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos; n=2,317) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg; n=74,850) patients for the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia\/dysgeusia (27.1-fold), fever\/chills (2.6-fold), respiratory difficulty (2.2-fold), cough (2.2-fold), myalgia\/arthralgia (2-fold), and diarrhea (1.4-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The combination of cough and fever\/chills has 4.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia\/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19. This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional biomedical knowledge. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, thus enabling EHR-powered early disease diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"FNU Shweta","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Karthik Murugadoss","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Samir Awasthi","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Sairam Bade","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Martin Kang","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Brian W Pickering","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Philippe R Bauer","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Raymund R Razonable","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Vergidis","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Zelalem Temesgen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Stacey Rizza","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Maryam Mahmood","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Walter R Wilson","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Douglas Challener","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Praveen Anand","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Matt Liebers","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Zainab Doctor","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Eli Silvert","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Hugo Solomon","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Akash Anand","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Barve","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20062117","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics of Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients in New York City","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20062117","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Background: The coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, with over 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide. Data are needed regarding the clinical course of hospitalized patients, particularly in the United States. Methods Demographic, clinical, and outcomes data for patients admitted to five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals with confirmed Covid-19 between February 27 and April 2, 2020 were identified through institutional electronic health records. We conducted a descriptive study of patients who had in-hospital mortality or were discharged alive. Results A total of 2,199 patients with Covid-19 were hospitalized during the study period. As of April 2nd, 1,121 (51%) patients remained hospitalized, and 1,078 (49%) completed their hospital course. Of the latter, the overall mortality was 29%, and 36% required intensive care. The median age was 65 years overall and 75 years in those who died. Pre-existing conditions were present in 65% of those who died and 46% of those discharged. In those who died, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 11.7%, D-dimer was 2.4 ug\/ml, C-reactive protein was 162 mg\/L, and procalcitonin was 0.44 ng\/mL. In those discharged, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 16.6%, D-dimer was 0.93 ug\/ml, C-reactive protein was 79 mg\/L, and procalcitonin was 0.09 ng\/mL. Conclusions This is the largest and most diverse case series of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in the United States to date. Requirement of intensive care and mortality were high. Patients who died typically had pre-existing conditions and severe perturbations in inflammatory markers.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ishan Paranjpe","author_inst":"Ican School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adam Russak","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jessica K De Freitas","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Anuradha Lala","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Miotto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Akhil Vaid","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kipp W Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matteo Danieletto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eddye Golden","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dara Meyer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Manbir Singh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Somani","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sayan Manna","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Udit Nangia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arjun Kapoor","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ross O'Hagan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Paul F O'Reilly","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Laura M Huckins","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Glowe","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arash Kia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Prem Timsina","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert M Freeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Levin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Finkelstein","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith A Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Bagiella","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carol R Horowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071654","rel_title":"A study on control of novel corona-virus (2019-nCoV) disease process by using PID controller","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071654","rel_abs":"In this paper, the SEIR dynamic model will be used to model the epidemic of coronvirus (2019-nCoV)disease.

Equipment shortages and varying testing capabilities have however hindered the usefulness of the official reported positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce four complementary approaches to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, using a combination of excess influenza-like illness reports, COVID-19 test statistics, COVID-19 mortality reports, and a spatially structured epidemic model. Instead of relying on the estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our four approaches emerges the consistent conclusion that on April 4, 2020, the estimated case count was 5 to 50 times higher than the official positive test counts across the different states. Nationally, our estimates of COVID-19 symptomatic cases as of April 4 have a likely range of 2.2 to 4.9 million, with possibly as many as 8.1 million cases, up to 26 times greater than the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000. Extending our method to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 6.0 to 10.3 million, as opposed to 1.5 million positive test counts. The proposed combination of approaches may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during resurgences in the US and other countries with comparable surveillance systems.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fred S Lu","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Andre T Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County"},{"author_name":"Nicholas B Link","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jessica T Davis","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Chinazzi","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Conclusions GI symptoms can be an early and not negligible feature of Covid-19, and might be correlated with a more benign disease course.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisabetta Buscarini","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Guido Manfredi","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Brambilla","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Menozzi","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Claudio Londoni","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Saverio Alicante","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Elena Iiritano","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Samanta Romeo","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Marianna Pedaci","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giampaolo Benelli","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Ciro Canetta","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lapiana","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Scartabellati","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Guido Merli","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Vigano","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Sfogliarini","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Melilli","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Assandri","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital Crema"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Sebastiano Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Germano Pellegata","author_inst":"ASST Maggiore Hospital, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Finkelstein","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith A Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Bagiella","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carol R Horowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20065219","rel_title":"The association between age, COVID-19 symptoms, and social distancing behavior in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20065219","rel_abs":"Abstract Background Public health authorities recommend that people practice social distancing, especially if they have symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID 19), or are older and more at risk of serious illness if they become infected. We test the hypothesis that these groups are following these recommendations and are more likely to undertake social distancing. Methods We conducted an open online survey of 4,676 U.S. adults aged 18 and older between April 4 and April 7, 2020. We model the effects of age and common COVID-19 symptoms in the last two weeks on going out of the home for non-healthcare reasons the day before taking the survey, using a logistic model and the number of close contacts (within 6 feet) that respondents had with non-household members, using a Poisson count model. Our models control for several covariates, including other flu-like symptoms, sex, education, income, whether the respondent worked in February, household size, population density in the respondents ZIP code, state fixed effects, and the day of completion of the survey. We also weight our analyses to make the sample representative of the U.S. adult population. Findings About 52 percent of the adult United States population went out of their home the previous day. On average, adults had close contact with 1.9 non-household members. We find that having at least one COVID-19 symptom (fever, dry cough, or shortness of breath) increased the likelihood of going out the previous day and having additional close contacts with non-household members; however, the estimates were not statistically significant. When disaggregating our analysis by COVID 19 symptoms, we find no strong evidence of greater social distancing by people with a fever or cough in the last two weeks, but we do find that those who experienced shortness of breath have fewer close contacts, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.30 to 0.78). Having other flu-like symptoms reduces the odds of going out by 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.60) and the incidence rate of having close contacts by 42 percent (IRR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.88). We find that older people are just as likely to leave their homes as younger people, but people over the age of 50 had less than half the predicted number of close contacts than those who were younger than 30. Our approach has the limitation that the survey sample is self-selected. Our findings may therefore be subject to selection bias that is not adequately controlled for by weighting. In addition, the possibility exists of confounding of the results due to omitted variable bias. Conclusions We provide evidence that older people are having significantly fewer close contacts than younger people, which is in line with the public health authorities recommendations. We also find that people experiencing shortness of breath are practicing more intense social distancing. However, we find that those with two other common COVID 19 symptoms, fever and dry cough, are not engaging in greater social distancing, suggesting that increased targeting on relevant symptoms, and messaging, may be required.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Canning","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known. Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy. Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NF{kappa}B. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines. Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF- in most severe patients. These data also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jerome Hadjadj","author_inst":"Imagine institute, laboratory of Immunogenetics of Pediatric Autoimmune Diseases, INSERM UMR 1163, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Nader Yatim","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Laura Barnabei","author_inst":"Imagine institute, laboratory of Immunogenetics of Pediatric Autoimmune Diseases, INSERM UMR 1163, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Corneau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, Faculte de medecine, UMS037, PASS, Plateforme de cytometrie de la Pitie-Salpetriere CyPS, F-75013, Paris"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Boussier","author_inst":"Laboratory of Dendritic Cell Immunobiology, Department of Immunology, Institut Pasteur, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Helene Pere","author_inst":"Department of Virology, APHP-CUP, Universite de Paris, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Bruno Charbit","author_inst":"Centre for Translational Research, Institut Pasteur, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Vincent Bondet","author_inst":"Laboratory of Dendritic Cell Immunobiology, Department of Immunology, Institut Pasteur, F-75015, Paris"},{"author_name":"Camille Chenevier-Gobeaux","author_inst":"Department of Automated Diagnostic Biology, APHP.

countries and regions. By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases. Methods This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients. Results 34.3% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1*109\/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P<0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5% of the pneumonia cases. Conclusion Imported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Puyu Shi","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Guoxia Ren","author_inst":"Xi'an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Yang","author_inst":"Ankang City Central Hospital;

Materials and Method: A consecutive cohort of 73 COVID-19 and 48 influenza pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five independent institutions. The courses of both diseases were confirmed to be in the early stages (mean 2.66 (SD 2.62) days for COVID-19 and mean 2.19 (SD 2.10) days for influenza pneumonia after onset). The chi-square test, student`s t-test, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test were performed to compare CT imaging and clinical features between the two groups. Spearman or Kendall correlation tests between feature metrics and diagnosis outcomes were also assessed. The diagnostic performance of each feature in differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia was evaluated with univariate analysis. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and threshold were reported. Results: The ground-glass opacification (GGO) was the most common imaging feature in COVID-19, including pure-GGO (75.3%) and mixed-GGO (78.1%), mainly in peripheral distribution. For clinical features, most COVID-19 patients presented normal white blood cell (WBC) count (89.04%) and neutrophil count (84.93%). Twenty imaging features and 6 clinical features were identified to be significantly different between the two diseases. The diagnosis outcomes correlated significantly with the WBC count (r=-0.526, P<0.001) and neutrophil count (r=-0.500, P<0.001). Four CT imaging features had absolute correlations coefficients higher than 0.300 (P<0.001), including crazy-paving pattern, mixed-GGO in peripheral area, pleural effusions, and consolidation. Conclusions: Among a total of 1537 lesions and 62 imaging and clinical features, 26 features were demonstrated to be significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. The crazy-paving pattern was recognized as the most powerful imaging feature for the differential diagnosis in the early stage, while WBC count yielded the highest diagnostic efficacy in clinical manifestations.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiqi Yang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Meizhou People`s Hospital, Guangdong, 514031, P.

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited. Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I 2=90.9%) or the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS). Conclusions: Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.

To mine Twitter to quantitatively analyze COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by users, compare symptom distributions against clinical studies, and create a symptom lexicon for the research community. Materials and methods We retrieved tweets using COVID-19-related keywords, and performed semi-automatic filtering to curate self-reports of positive-tested users. We extracted COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned by the users, mapped them to standard concept IDs (UMLS), and compared the distributions to those reported in early studies from clinical settings. Results We identified 203 positive-tested users who reported 1002 symptoms using 668 unique expressions. The most frequently-reported symptoms were fever\/pyrexia (66.1%), cough (57.9%), body ache\/pain (42.7%), fatigue (42.1%), headache (37.4%), and dyspnea (36.3%) amongst users who reported at least 1 symptom. Mild symptoms, such as anosmia (28.7%) and ageusia (28.1%) were frequently reported on Twitter, but not in clinical studies. Conclusion The spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms identified from Twitter may complement those identified in clinical settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abeed

SARS-CoV-2 require reliable information about the spread of the infecting agent. Often real-time PCR screening of large populations is a feasible method to generate this information. Since test capacities are usually limited, pooling of test specimens is often necessary to increase screening capacity, provided that the test sensitivity is not significantly compromised. However, when a traditional pool is tested positive, all samples in the pool need individual retesting, which becomes ineffective at a higher proportion of positive samples. Here, we report a new pooling protocol that mitigates this problem by replicating samples across multiple pools. The resulting pool set allows the sample status to be resolved more often than with traditional pooling. At 2% prevalence and 20 samples per pool, our protocol increases screening capacity by factors of 5 and 2 compared to individual testing and traditional pooling, respectively. The corresponding software to layout and resolve samples is freely available under a BSD license (https:\/\/github.com\/phiweger\/clonepool).","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Viehweger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Felix K\u00fchnl","author_inst":"Interdisciplinary Center of Bioinformatics, University Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Christian Brandt","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brigitte K\u00f6nig","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Arne C.

implications of changes in blood parameters and cellular immune function in patients with 2019-coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19). Methods: Records were reviewed of 85 patients with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality at 28 days. Results: Fourteen patients died. The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO2\/FiO2, CD3+ count and CD4+ count. The percentage of neutrophil count > 6.3*109\/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count was independently associated with mortality. However, there were not significant difference in IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4 and the percentage of IgE > 100 IU\/ml between the death group and survival group. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the following at baseline could significantly predict mortality: leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts. Conclusions: For patients with COVID-19, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts that marked decrease suggest a poor outcome. A high neutrophil count is independently associated with mortality. At admission, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts should receive added attention.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yue-qiang Fu","author_inst":"Childrens

used as supportive therapy, but the treatment of COVID-19 by IVIG is controversial. This rapid review aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children with severe COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively. Results: A total of 1519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally six studies, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG. One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19 adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between low and very low. Conclusions: The existing evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy or safety of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19.

The pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing great loss. Detecting viral RNAs is standard approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with variable success. Currently, studies describing the serological diagnostic methods are emerging, while most of them just involve the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by ELISA or flow immunoassay with limited accuracy. Methods. Diagnostic approach depends on chemiluminescence immunoanalysis (CLIA) for detecting IgA, IgM and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed. The approach was tested with 216 sera from 87 COVID-19 patients and 483 sera from SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Concentration kinetics of RBD-specific serum antibodies were characterized. The relationship of serum RBD-specific antibodies and disease severity was analyzed. Results. The diagnostic accuracy based on RBD outperformed those based on NP. Adding IgA to a conventional serological test containing IgM and IgG improves sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at early stage. CLIA for detecting RBD-specific IgA, IgM and IgG showed diagnostic sensitivities of 98.6%, 96.8% and 96.8%, and specificities of 98.1%, 92.3% and 99.8%, respectively. Median concentration of IgA and IgM peaked during 16-20 days after illness onset at 8.84 g\/mL and 7.25 g\/mL, respectively, while IgG peaked during 21-25 days after illness onset at 16.47 g\/mL. Furthermore, the serum IgA level positively correlates with COVID-19 severity. Conclusion. CLIA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgM and IgG in blood provides additional values for diagnosing and monitoring of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huan

(SARS-CoV-2) has caused a rapidly unfolding pandemic, overwhelming health care systems worldwide1. Clinical manifestations of Corona-virus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death2, yet the underlying physiological conditions and mechanisms for this high variability are still unknown. Also, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance and its involvement in pathogenesis remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002\/03), however, CD4+ T cell responses are generally associated with positive outcomes3,4, while cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been investigated. Here we describe an assay that allows direct detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. We demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4+ T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy donors, albeit at lower frequencies. Strikingly, in COVID-19 patients S-reactive CD4+ T cells equally targeted both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of S whereas in healthy donors S-reactive CD4+ T cells reacted almost exclusively to the Cterminal part that is a) characterized by higher homology to spike glycoprotein of human endemic \"common cold\" coronaviruses, and b) contains the S2 subunit of S with the cytoplasmic peptide (CP), the fusion peptide (FP), and the transmembrane domain (TM) but not the receptor-binding domain (RBD). S-reactive CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients were further distinct to those from healthy donors as they co-expressed higher levels of CD38 and HLA-DR, indicating their recent in vivo activation. Our study is the first to directly measure SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses providing critical tools for large scale testing, in depth epitope mapping and characterization of potential cross-reactive cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in healthy donors is of high interest but larger scale prospective cohort studies are needed to assess whether their presence is a correlate of protection or pathology. Results of such studies will be key for a mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adaptation of containment methods and to support vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian Braun","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lucie Loyal","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Marco Frentsch","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Philipp Georg","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Manuela Dingeldey","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Beate Kruse","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florent Fauchere","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Emre Baysal","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maike Mangold","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Larissa Henze","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Roland Lauster","author_inst":"Technische Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Marcus Mall","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Beyer","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jobst Roehmel","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.20.20061861","rel_title":"Interleukin-6 blockade for severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.20.20061861","rel_abs":"In the context of COVID-19 pandemic and growing tensions worldwide regarding healthcare facilities, there is an urgent need for effective treatments likely to reduce the crunch of ICU beds. Following the assumption by Mehta and colleagues who exhorted physicians to screen patients with severe COVID-19 for hyperinflammation and investigate immunomodulatory drugs in this setting, we relate our short-term - yet promising - experience regarding IL6 blockade with tocilizumab in 30 selected patients of less than 80 years of age, >5 days of prior disease duration, severe (i.e. requiring strictly over 6L\/min of oxygen therapy) rapidly deteriorating (i.e. increase by more than 3L\/min of oxygen flow within the previous 12 hours) COVID-19-related pneumonia. By comparison with a control group of patients (matched for age, gender and disease severity using the inverse probability of treatment weighted methodology) that did not receive tocilizumab. We demonstrate that, in highly selected patients, IL6 blockade could curb the \"cytokine storm\", prevent ICU admission and the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of this retrospective small sample-size study, we believe that these preliminary findings support the fostering of research efforts in the fight against COVID-19-induced inflammation, especially before patients require admission to the ICU.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mathilde ROUMIER","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"},{"author_name":"Romain PAULE","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthieu GROH","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexandre VALLEE","author_inst":"Hotel Dieu Hospital"},{"author_name":"Felix ACKERMANN","author_inst":"FOCH Hospital"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Manuela Dingeldey","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Beate Kruse","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florent Fauchere","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Emre Baysal","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maike Mangold","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Larissa Henze","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Roland Lauster","author_inst":"Technische Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Marcus Mall","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Beyer","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jobst Roehmel","author_inst":"Charite Universiteatsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20054262","rel_title":"Pulmonary post-mortem findings in a large series of COVID-19 cases from Northern Italy","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20054262","rel_abs":"Importance. The analysis of lung tissues of patients with COVID-19 may help understand pathogenesis and clinical outcomes in this life-threatening respiratory illness. Objective. To determine the histological patterns in lung tissue of patients with severe COVID-19. Design and participants. Lungs tissues of 38 cases who died for COVID-19 in two hospital of Northern Italy were systematically analysed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry for the inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components, electron microscopy were performed. Results. The features of the exudative and proliferative phases of Diffuse Alveolar Disease (DAD) were found: capillary congestion, necrosis of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, interstitial oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia and reactive atypia, platelet-fibrin thrombi. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed by macrophages in alveolar lumens and lymphocytes mainly in the interstitium. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles within cytoplasmic vacuoles of pneumocytes. Conclusions and relevance. The predominant pattern of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients is DAD, as described for the other two coronavirus that infect humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequently found. The main relevant finding is the presence of platelet-fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels; this important observation fits into the clinical context of coagulopathy which dominates in these patients and which is one of the main targets of therapy.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Carsana","author_inst":"Pathology Unit, L.

We extended this model to 31 countries outside China experiencing serious COVID-2019 outbreaks. The model well explained the data in our study (R2 >0.95). For infected cases, the semi-saturation period (SSP) ranges from 63 to 170 days (March 3 to June 18). The logistic growth rate of infected cases is positively correlated with that of recovered cases, and the same holds for the SSP. According to the linear connection between the growth rules for infected and recovered cases identified from the Chinese data, we predicted that the SSP of the recovered cases outside China ranges from 82 to 196 days (March 22 to July 8). More importantly, we found a strong positive correlation between the SSP of infected cases and the timing of the government's response, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of rapid epidemic control measures in various countries.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chuanliang Han","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yimeng Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jiting Tang","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yuyao Zhu","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Carlo Jaeger","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Saini Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Roberto Rech","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"Dept.

While reducing mortality, these measures result in severe economic repercussions, and inhibit the development of herd immunity. Until an effective vaccine will be available, we propose an alternative approach, akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which intentionally triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its main goal is to approach herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with lower mortality rates and lower demand for critical health-care resources. According to this approach, individuals whose probability of developing serious health conditions is low (i.e. 20-49 years old with no comorbidities) will be offered the option to be voluntarily exposed to the virus under controlled supervision, and will then be issued 'immunity certificates' if they are confirmed to have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Using a compartmental model we examine the implications of the controlled avalanche (CA) strategy over the population in Israel. We compare four scenarios: in two scenarios the CA program is applied to the low-risk population (with the rest of the population subject to mitigation measures), followed by mitigation for the entire population or by uncontrolled spread. These are compared to mitigated and uncontrolled scenarios without the CA program. We discuss the economic, ethical and public health implications of the CA strategy. Findings: We show that compared to mitigation of the entire population, the CA strategy reduces the overall mortality by 43%, reduces the maximum number of people in need for ICUs by 62% and decreases the time required for release of 50% of the low-risk population by more than 2 months. Interpretation: This study suggests an ethically acceptable practice, that enables reaching herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with low mortality and minimal economic damage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eyal Klement","author_inst":"Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alon Klement","author_inst":"Buchmann Faculty of Law, Tel-Aviv University, Israel"},{"author_name":"David Chinitz","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alon Harel","author_inst":"Phillip and Estelle Mizock Chair in Administrative and Criminal Law, The Faculty of Law, the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eyal Fattal","author_inst":"Department of Applied Mathematics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ziv Klausner","author_inst":"Department of Applied Mathematics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Roberto Rech","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"Dept.

Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and how this varies between countries may inform the design of possible strategies to shield those at highest risk. Methods We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease by age (5-year age groups), sex and country (n=188) based on prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2017 and United Nations population estimates for 2020. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. Results We estimate that 1.7 (1.0 - 2.4) billion individuals (22% [15-28%] of the global population) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The share of the population at increased risk ranges from 16% in Africa to 31% in Europe. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50+ years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV\/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk. The prevalence of multimorbidity (>1 underlying conditions) was three times higher in Europe than in Africa (10% vs 3%). Conclusion Based on current guidelines and prevalence data from GBD, we estimate that one in five individuals worldwide has a condition that is on the list of those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, for many of these individuals the underlying condition will be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be captured in health systems, and in some cases the increase in risk may be quite modest. There is an urgent need for robust analyses of the risks associated with different underlying conditions so that countries can identify the highest risk groups and develop targeted shielding policies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Clark","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Warren-Gash","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Harry HX Wang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Stewart W Mercer","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Colin Sanderson","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Martin McKee","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Christopher Troeger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kanyin I Ong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Pablo Perel","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sarah Joseph","author_inst":"IAVI"},{"author_name":"Hamish P Gibbs","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20059535","rel_title":"Modeling projections for COVID-19 pandemic by combining epidemiological, statistical, and neural network approaches","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20059535","rel_abs":"As the number of people affected by COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 ebbs and flows in different national and sub-national regions across the world, it is evident that our lifestyle and socio-economic trajectories will have to be adapted and adjusted to the changing scenarios. Novel forecasting tools and frameworks provide an arguable advantage to facilitate this adapting and adjusting process, by promoting efficient resource management at individual and institutional levels. Based on deterministic compartment models we propose an empirical top-down modeling approach to provide epidemic forecasts and risk calculations for (local) outbreaks. We use neural networks to develop leading indicators based on available data for different regions. These indicators are not only used to assess the risk of a (new) outbreak or to determine the effectiveness of a measure at an early stage, but also in parametric models to determine an effective forecast, along with the associated uncertainty. Based on initial results, we show the performance of such an approach and its robustness against inherent disturbances in epidemiological surveillance data. We foresee such a statistical framework to drive web-based automatic platforms to democratize the dissemination of prognosis results.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen Uhlig","author_inst":"QuoData GmbH"},{"author_name":"Kapil Nichani","author_inst":"QuoData GmbH"},{"author_name":"Carsten Uhlig","author_inst":"Akees GmbH"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Simon","author_inst":"QuoData GmbH"},{"author_name":"Harry HX Wang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Stewart W Mercer","author_inst":"Edinburgh University"},{"author_name":"Colin Sanderson","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Martin McKee","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Christopher Troeger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kanyin I Ong","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Pablo Perel","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sarah Joseph","author_inst":"IAVI"},{"author_name":"Hamish P Gibbs","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20067975","rel_title":"LONG-TERM CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN SURVIVORS OF CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAKS AFTER HOSPITALISATION OR ICU ADMISSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF FOLLOW-UP STUDIES","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20067975","rel_abs":"Objective: To determine the long-term clinical problems in adult survivors of coronavirus (CoV) infection [Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)] after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term. Conclusions: The long term clinical problems in survivors of CoV infections (SARS and MERS) after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission include respiratory dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, psychological problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Critical care, rehabilitation and mental health services should anticipate a high prevalence of these problems following COVID-19 and ensure their adequate and timely management with the aim of restoring premorbid quality of life.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hassaan Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Kajal Patel","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Darren Greenwood","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Stephen Halpin","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Penny Lewthwaite","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Abayomi Salawu","author_inst":"Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorna Eyre","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew Breen","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Anthony Jones","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Manoj Sivan","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Francesco Checchi","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Pablo Perel","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sarah Joseph","author_inst":"IAVI"},{"author_name":"Hamish P Gibbs","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070367","rel_title":"Utah-Stanford Ventilator (Vent4US): Developing a rapidlyscalable ventilator for COVID-19 patients with ARDS","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070367","rel_abs":"We describe a minimum, rapidly scalable ventilator designed for COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

To do so we employ a modular design approach and broadly explore taking advantage of parts from non-traditional supply chains. In our current prototype, we demonstrate volume control with assist control on a test lung and present a linear actuator-driven pinch valve-based implementation for both pressure control and volume control with decelerating inspiratory flow. We estimate the component cost of the system to be around $500. We publish our draft design documents and current implementation which is open and accessible in the hope that broadening the community globally will accelerate arriving at a solution and that peer review will improve the final design.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongquan Li","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ethan Li","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Deepak Krishnamurthy","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Kolbay","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Beca Chacin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Soeren Hoehne","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jim Cybulski","author_inst":"Foldscope Instruments"},{"author_name":"Lara Brewer","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Petelenz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Joseph Orr","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Derek Sakata","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Thomas Clardy","author_inst":"CKC Medical, Utah"},{"author_name":"Kai Kuck","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Manu Prakash","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20067991","rel_title":"The Contribution of Age Structure to the Number of Deaths from Covid-19 in the UK by Geographical Units","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20067991","rel_abs":"This study investigates the contribution of population age structure to mortality from Covid-19 in the UK by geographical units. We project death rates at various spatial scales by applying data on age-specific fatality rates to the area's population by age and sex. Our analysis shows a significant variation in the projected death rates between the constituent countries of the UK, between its regions and within regions. First, Scotland and Wales have higher projected fatality levels from Covid-19 than England, whereas Northern Ireland has lower rate. Second, the infection fatality rates are projected to be substantially higher in small towns and rural areas than those in large urban areas. Third, our analysis shows that within urban regions there are also 'pockets' of high projected death rates. Overall, the areas with high and low fatality rates tend to cluster because of the high residential separation of different population age-groups in the UK. Our analysis also reveals that the Welsh-, Gaelic- and Cornish-speaking communities with relatively old populations are likely to experience heavy population losses if the virus spreads widely across the UK.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hill Kulu","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Peter Dorey","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Deepak Krishnamurthy","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Kolbay","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Beca Chacin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Soeren Hoehne","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jim Cybulski","author_inst":"Foldscope Instruments"},{"author_name":"Lara Brewer","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Petelenz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Joseph Orr","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Derek Sakata","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Thomas Clardy","author_inst":"CKC Medical, Utah"},{"author_name":"Kai Kuck","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Manu Prakash","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juergen Schmitz","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Miltenyi","author_inst":"Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Witzenrath","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Norbert Suttorp","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Florian Kern","author_inst":"JPT Petide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulf Reimer","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Holger Wenschuh","author_inst":"JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Victor M Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Claudia Giesecke-Thiel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics"},{"author_name":"Leif-Erik Sander","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Andreas Thiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Barbara Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jagat Narula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric J Nestler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dennis S Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C Just","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erwin P Bottinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Girish Nadkarni","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
