As a hopeful extrapolation, the existing data might be considered low time-axis values of Sigmoid-type function, whose growth might be saturated to values of 10^4 or 10^5. To fulfill this expectation, a turning from increasing to decreasing trend in new case data should be noticed around April-May, which definitely demand extension of present lock-down with additional interventions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SUPRIYA MONDAL","author_inst":"Aadarsh Nursing Institute"},{"author_name":"Sabyasachi Ghosh","author_inst":"IIT Bhilai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0_ng","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.039917","rel_title":"Human organs-on-chips as tools for repurposing approved drugs as potential influenza and COVID19 therapeutics in viral pandemics","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.039917","rel_abs":"The rising threat of pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, requires development of new preclinical discovery platforms that can more rapidly identify therapeutics that are active in vitro and also translate in vivo. Here we show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by highly differentiated human primary lung airway epithelium and endothelium can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain-dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential. We provide a first demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivirs therapeutic time window. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the Organ Chip platform. When administered in human Airway Chips under flow at a clinically relevant dose, one drug - amodiaquine - significantly inhibited infection by a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. Proof of concept was provided by showing that amodiaquine and its active metabolite (desethylamodiaquine) also significantly reduce viral load in both direct infection and animal-to-animal transmission models of native SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. These data highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Longlong Si","author_inst":"Wyss institute at Harvard university"},{"author_name":"Haiqing Bai","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering"},{"author_name":"Melissa Rodas","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering"},{"author_name":"Wuji Cao","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering"},{"author_name":"Crystal Yur Oh","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering"},{"author_name":"Amanda Jiang","author_inst":"Wyss institute at Harvard university"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moller","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daisy Hoagland","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kohei Oishi","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shu Horiuchi","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Skyler Uhl","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Blanco-Melo","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Randy A.

In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (like age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wladimir Lyra","author_inst":"Department of Astronomy, New Mexico State University, PO Box 30001, MSC 4500, Las Cruces, NM 88003-8001, USA"},{"author_name":"Jose Dias do Nascimento","author_inst":"Dep. de Fisica Teorica e Experimental, DFTE, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Avenida Senador Salgado Filho, 3000.

However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We evaluate one-pot operation of both individual and multiplex LAMP-OSD assays and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanchita Bhadra","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Timothy E Riedel","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Simren Lakhotia","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nicholas D Tran","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Ellington","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ion de Andrade","author_inst":"Departamento de Saude Coletiva, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Avenida Senador Salgado Filho, 3000.

The notion that the first wave of infection is close to its peak begs the question of whether future peaks or second waves are likely. We sought to determine the current size of the effective (i.e. susceptible) population for seven European countries - to estimate immunity levels following this first wave. We compare these numbers to the total population sizes of these countries, in order to investigate the potential for future peaks. Methods: We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5th 2020. Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Results: Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. Using for all countries, with a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland. Conclusion: Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity. This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely. These findings may have implications for exit strategies from any lockdown stage.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosalyn J Moran","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Erik D Fagerholm","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jean Daunizeau","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Maell Cullen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mark P Richardson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Williams","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Federico Turkheimer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rob Leech","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Karl Friston","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Shu Horiuchi","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Skyler Uhl","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Blanco-Melo","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Randy A.

While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Jay Corley","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Sugai","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Schotsaert","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert  E.

Within Europe, the first countries to be strongly affected have been Italy and Spain. In Spain, infection has expanded in highly populated areas, resulting in one of the largest nationwide bursts so far by early April. We analyze the evolution of the growth curve of the epidemic in both the whole of Spain, Madrid Autonomous Region (the second largest conurbation in Europe), and Catalonia (which includes Spain's second largest city), based on the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths. We conducted segmented, poisson regressions on log-transformed data to identify changes in the slope of these curves and\/or sudden shifts in the number of cases (i.e. changes in the intercept) at fitted breaking points, and compared their results with a timeline including both key events of the epidemic and containment measures taken by the national and regional governments. Results were largely consistent in the six curves analyzed (reported infections and deaths for Spain, Madrid and Catalonia, respectively), showing three major clusters of shifts in slopes (growth rates) on March 13-19, March 23-29 and April 1-5 that resulted in 33-71% reductions of slope, and originated in infections on March 3-9, 13-19 and 22-26; as well as a decrease in the infection rate following the strengthened lockdown of 29-30 April, only for Madrid and Catalonia. Small upward shifts in the progress of the disease in Madrid were not associated with significant increases in the intercept of the curve, and seem related with unevenness in case reporting; but they did so in Spain and Catalonia, where they were probably associated to specific events of group infection in Vitoria and to the onset of the outbreak in Catalonia. These results evidence an early deceleration in the spread of COVID-19 coinciding with personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations, as well as the general awareness of the population; and a second, stronger decrease when harder isolation measures were enforced. The combination of these two inflection points seemingly led to the start of the contention of the disease outbreak by early April, the limit of our time series. This highlights the importance of adopting public health strategies that include disseminating basic knowledge on personal hygiene and reduced social contact at the onset of the epidemic, and the importance of early enforcement of hard confinement measures for its subsequent contention.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Santamaria","author_inst":"Donana Biological Station (EBD-CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Hortal","author_inst":"Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Michael Schotsaert","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert  E.

The disease was first identified as a cluster of respiratory illness in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread across the globe to greater than 200 countries. Healthcare providers are at an increased risk for contracting the disease due to occupational exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators. The rapid worldwide spread of high numbers of COVID-19 cases has facilitated the need for a substantial supply of PPE that is largely unavailable in many settings, thereby creating critical shortages. Creative solutions for the decontamination and safe reuse of PPE to protect our frontline healthcare personnel are essential. Here, we describe the development of a process that began in late February 2020 for selecting and implementing the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) as viable method to reprocess N95 respirators. Since pre-existing HPV decontamination chambers were not available, we optimized the sterilization process in an operating room after experiencing initial challenges in other environments. Details are provided about the prioritization and implementation of processes for collection and storage, pre-processing, HPV decontamination, and post-processing of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Important lessons learned from this experience include, developing an adequate reserve of PPE for effective reprocessing and distribution, and identifying a suitable location with optimal environmental controls (i.e., operating room). Collectively, information presented here provides a framework for other institutions considering decontamination procedures for N95 respirators.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Douglas Jay Perkins","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, UNM Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Villescas","author_inst":"University of New Mexico Hospital, Facilities Safety"},{"author_name":"Terry H Wu","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Preventive Medicine, Center for Infectious Disease and Immunity, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New"},{"author_name":"Timothy B Muller","author_inst":"Office of Research, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Bradfute","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences      Center"},{"author_name":"Ivy Foo-Hurwitz","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center"},{"author_name":"Qiuying Cheng","author_inst":"Center for Global Health, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center"},{"author_name":"Hannah Wilcox","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Myissa Weiss","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Chris Bartlett","author_inst":"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Jens Langsjoen","author_inst":"Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Phil Seidenberg","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Randy A.

Results: All 55 patients included 47 (85.5%) non-severe patients and 8 (14.5%) severe patients. Common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Common symptoms were fever, cough and sputum. Lymphopenia was a common laboratory finding, and ground-glass opacity was a common chest CT feature. All patients received antiviral therapy of -interferon inhalation and lopinavir-ritonavir tablets. Common complications included acute liver injury and respiratory failure. All patients were discharged. No death was occurred and no medical staff got infected. Patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly older age, decreased lymphocytes, increased C reactive protein, and higher frequency of bilateral lung infiltration compared to non-severe patients. Significantly more treatments including antibiotic therapy and mechanical ventilation, longer hospitalization stay and higher cost were shown on severe patients.

Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. Study design: We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations. Results: We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate.

Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. Data Sources: The research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 4 traditional Chinese medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) were extracted. Conclusions: All of the repurposed drugs that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides an insight to experimental validation of drugs and alternative medicine used for the treatment and control of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fui Fui Lem","author_inst":"Ministry of Health Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Fernandes Opook","author_inst":"Wildlife Health Genetic and Forensic Laboratory, Wildlife and Health Department"},{"author_name":"Dexter Lee Jiunn Herng","author_inst":"Universiti Malaysia Sabah"},{"author_name":"Chee Fong Tyng","author_inst":"Universiti Malaysia Sabah"},{"author_name":"Fahcina P Lawson","author_inst":"The Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Chin Su Na","author_inst":"Universiti Malaysia Sabah"},{"author_name":"Jiehui Huang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qian You","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua Meng","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Zhang","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Qian","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuanwang Qiu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wen-Chun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Tristan Jordan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"},{"author_name":"Benjamin E.

While tests such as RT-PCR have applications in the immediate diagnosis revealing the presence of the virus, serological tests can be used to determine previous exposure to the virus and complement acute diagnosis. Antibody production can occur as early as 5 days post-infection. Both IgM and IgG specific anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies can be a useful tool to test faster and larger groups of individuals. The objective of this study was to carry out a review of the different serological tests offered to detect antigen or antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This information should be useful for decision takers in different countries to choose a test according to their needs. Based on web pages that listed serological assays, we found 226 coming from 20 countries, the majority are indirect tests for specific antibodies detection (n 180) and use immunochromatography methods (n 110) with samples coming from blood-derived products (n 105). Measuring IgM\/IgG at the same time (n 112) and a procedure time of <20 min (n 83) are the most common. The overall average sensitivity was 91.8% and specificity was 97%. Most of the tests are currently for in vitro diagnosis (IVD).

The susceptibility to infection of populations in that region has been debated. Outbreaks on the scale of those seen elsewhere would pose substantial challenges. There are reasons for concern that transmission may be high and difficult to control, rapidly exceeding capacity to meet the needs for hospitalization and critical care. Methods We obtained data on daily new confirmed cases for all 46 countries from the World Health Organization, and used these to model and visualize growth trajectories using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. We then estimated doubling times from growth rates estimated from Poisson regression models, and by back counting from the most recent observation. We also calculated the time from 1st to 50th case, and the time from 5th to 100th case. These indicators were compared with the same summary indicators of growth at the same stage of the outbreak in highly affected European countries. Results Kenya was the only country with clear evidence of exponential growth. Nineteen countries had either reported no cases, were in the first few days of the outbreak, or had reported fewer than 10 cases over a period of two or more weeks. For the remaining 27 countries we identified four growth patterns: slow linear growth, more rapid linear growth, variable growth patterns over the course of the outbreak, and early signs of possible exponential growth. For those in the last three groups, doubling times ranged from 3 to 4 days, times from 1st to 50th case from 12 to 29 days, and from 5th to 100th case from eight to 15 days. These early indicators are comparable to those in European countries that have gone on to have substantial outbreaks, and time to 50th case was shorter suggesting lesser effectiveness of contact-tracing and quarantine in the early phase. Conclusion The 46 sub-Saharan African countries, home to over one billion people, are at a tipping point with clear potential for the outbreak to follow a similar course as in HIC in the global north. Radical population-level physical distancing measures may be required, but their impact on poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people and communities need mitigating. Health systems in the region need urgent technical and material support, with testing, personal protection, and hospital\/ critical care.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin James Prince","author_inst":"King's Global Health Institute, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Atalay Alem","author_inst":"Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Dixon Chibanda","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London UK & Friendship Bench, Harare, Zimbabwe"},{"author_name":"Lara Fairall","author_inst":"University of Cape Town Lung Institute, Cape Town, South Africa & King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abebaw Fekadu","author_inst":"Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Hanlon","author_inst":"King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, UK & Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Crick Lund","author_inst":"King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, UK & University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Andrew JM Leather","author_inst":"Global Health Health Partnerships, King's College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Inge Petersen","author_inst":"University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Ruth Verhey","author_inst":"Friendship Bench, Harare, Zimbabwe"},{"author_name":"Haja Wurie","author_inst":"College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences, University of Sierra Leone, Freetown, Sierra Leone"},{"author_name":"Meifang Qian","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuanwang Qiu","author_inst":"Wuxi Fifth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wen-Chun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Tristan Jordan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"},{"author_name":"Benjamin E.

Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone. Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild\/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone. Results Among 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days ({+\/-}standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 ({+\/-}10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non-recipients (N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events. Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non-recipients.

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States. Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585\/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46). In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] >3.25 OR 8.73, 95% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Latitude of specific area where measurement took place was also provided in the database. Preliminary Kendall rank correlation test revealed that Covid-2019 incidence was positively and significantly related to ozone concentration; however, incidence was not significantly related to latitude. Using multivariate linear regression, a statistically significant link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence in 34 countries was established; however, I found no statistical association between latitude and Covid-2019 incidence refuting previous claims. Prompt health actions should be developed for areas with high ozone concentration in the present and possibly, future outbreaks; however, extensive laboratory analysis should be conducted to further confirm the findings of the study.

Methods: The clinical data of 45 moderate and severe type patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 13, 2020 were collected. The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively. Conclusions: The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD is the best hematology index and can help clinicians to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients, and it can be used as a useful indicator to help prevent and control the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"changzheng wang","author_inst":"The Second Clinical Medical College ,Yangtze University"},{"author_name":"Chengbin Li","author_inst":"The Second Clinical Medical College ,Yangtze University"},{"author_name":"Janet P.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we included patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from 20th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir\/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir\/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, isolation for a minimum of 21 days after onset of illness may be warranted, while the use of antiviral drugs does not enhance viral RNA clearance.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xudan Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Baoyi Zhu","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jianwen Zeng","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Wenxin Hong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Xi He","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jingfeng Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Zheng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Shuang Qiu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Ying Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Juliana Chan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity and Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Science, The Chinese University of Hong"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Kristina Crothers","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

Influenza as a respiratory tract infection disease as COVID-19 might also be controlled. To assess the effects, we used the total passenger numbers sent in mainland China from 2018 to 2020 and the daily number of railway passenger (DNRP) flow in 2020 during Spring Festival travel rush to reflect the population movement and further to analyze newly and cumulative confirmed COVID-19 and influenza. We found that with implementing the series measures on COVID-19, not only COVID-19, but also influenza mitigated in China. The prevention and control measures for COVID-19 might be used in controlling respiratory tract diseases, and reducing the national health economic burden.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n=50 patients, n=84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Hui Shi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

The COVID-19 virus is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. However, the fecal-oral transmission of the virus has not been ruled out and it is important to ascertain how acidic condition in the stomach affects the infectivity of the virus. Besides, it is unclear how stable the COVID-19 virus is under dry and wet conditions. In the present study, we have shown that the COVID-19 virus is extremely infectious as manifested by the infection of Vero-E6 cells by one PFU (Plaque Forming Unit) of the virus. We then investigated the stability of the COVID-19 virus in wet, dry and acidic (pH2.2) environments at room temperature. Results showed that the COVID-19 virus could survive for three days in wet and dry environments, but the dry condition is less favorable for the survival of the virus. Our study also demonstrated that the COVID-19 virus at a relative high titer (1.2 x 103 PFU) exhibits a certain degree of tolerance to acidic environment at least for 60 minutes. When the virus titer was [&le;]1.0 x 103 PFU, acid treatment (pH2.2) for 30 or 60 minute resulted in virus inactivation. It suggests that the virus at a high concentration may survive in the acidic environment of the stomach.

There are severe drawbacks to this strategy. The resulting flattened curve remains exponential and always under utilizes available healthcare capacity with a chance of still overburdening it. Moreover, while a mitigation strategy involving isolation and containment can scale down infections, it not only prolongs the outbreak significantly, but also leaves a susceptible population in its wake that's ripe for a secondary outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely with disastrous repercussions. Full mitigation for the duration of an outbreak is therefore unsustainable and, overall, a poor solution with potentially catastrophic consequences that could've been avoided. A new strategy, coined a \"Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management\", abbreviated MAPCM, presented herein can shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which enables economic activity to resume gradually from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as hospitalizations) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak; and to build herd immunity without the damaging side effects. The method can also be used to ease out of containment. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate outbreak model; and herein it is illustrated in examples using a hybrid logistic model.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Willem G Odendaal","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Meital Elbaz","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky medical center"},{"author_name":"Ronen Ben-Ami","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David Shasha","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tal Levinson","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guy Choshen","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Petrov","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Avi Gadoth","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yael Paran","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xun-jia Cheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Zheng-hong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"You-hua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthias T\u00e4ufer","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Meital Elbaz","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky medical center"},{"author_name":"Ronen Ben-Ami","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David Shasha","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tal Levinson","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guy Choshen","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Petrov","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Avi Gadoth","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yael Paran","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xun-jia Cheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Zheng-hong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"You-hua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis\/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.\n\nIMPORTANCEVaccines and new medicines are urgently needed to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, reduce the symptoms, shorten the duration of disease, prevent virus spread in the body, and most importantly to save lives. One of the key drug targets could be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a crucial receptor for the corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is known that SARS coronavirus infections lead to worse outcome in the elderly and in males. Therefore, one aim of the present study was to investigate whether age or sex could contribute to the regulation of ACE2 expression. We also decided to explore the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 gene expression. Since data on ACE2 distribution is still conflicting, we aimed to get a more comprehensive view of the cell types expressing the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we studied the coexpression of ACE2 with other genes and explored its putative functions using gene ontology enrichment analysis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harlan Barker","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Fimlab Ltd, Tampere University Hospital, Finland"},{"author_name":"Seppo Parkkila","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Fimlab Ltd, Tampere University Hospital, Finland"},{"author_name":"Ronen Ben-Ami","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David Shasha","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tal Levinson","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guy Choshen","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Petrov","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Avi Gadoth","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yael Paran","author_inst":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xun-jia Cheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Zheng-hong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"You-hua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Med"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"BSL-3 laboratory of Fudan University, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tamar H.
