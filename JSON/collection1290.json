Despite a constant background mutational rate, the virus must retain binding with ACE2 for infectivity, providing a conserved constraint for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To prevent mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2 and to prepare for future related coronavirus outbreaks, we engineered a de novo trimeric ACE2 (T-ACE2) protein scaffold that binds the trimeric spike protein with extremely high affinity (KD < 1 pM), while retaining ACE2 native sequence. T-ACE2 potently inhibits all tested pseudotyped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2. The cryo-EM structure reveals that T-ACE2 can induce the transit of spike protein to \"three-up\" RBD conformation upon binding. T-ACE2 thus represents a promising class of broadly neutralizing proteins against SARS-CoVs and mutants.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liang Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Bi","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xinling Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Renhong Yan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yaning Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Mingfeng Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xingyue Bao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhou","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Bobo Dang","author_inst":"Westlake University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.276675","rel_title":"Characterization of neutralizing versus binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 recovered individuals from India","rel_date":"2020-09-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.276675","rel_abs":"India is one of the countries most affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38\/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.\n\nImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses. These finding have timely significance for selection of appropriate individuals as donors for plasma intervention strategies, as well as determining vaccine efficacy.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaustuv Nayak","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kamalvishnu Gottimukkala","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanjeev Kumar","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elluri Seetharami Reddy","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Venkata Vishwanadh Edara","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Robert Kauffman","author_inst":"Emory"},{"author_name":"Katharine Floyd","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Grace Mantus","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Deepali Savargaonkar","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research"},{"author_name":"Pawan Kumar Goel","author_inst":"Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College"},{"author_name":"Satyam Arora","author_inst":"Super Speciality Pediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Training Institute"},{"author_name":"Manju Rahi","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Carl W.

The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nir Drayman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Krysten A Jones","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sarra-Anne Azizi","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Heather M Froggatt","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Kemin Tan","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ivanova Maltseva","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Siquan Chen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vlad Nicolaescu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Steve Dvorkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kevin Furlong","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rahul S Kathayat","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mason R Firpo","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mastrodomenico","author_inst":"Loyoloa University"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Madaline M Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Munoz-Alia","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Brooke Schuster","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Nair","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.30.274506","rel_title":"From Face-to-Face to Online Modality: Implications for Undergraduate Learning While the World is Temporarily Closed in the Age of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.30.274506","rel_abs":"The second half of the Spring 2020 semester has been an unprecedented time globally due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer online over F2F learning. Furthermore, the online modality significantly increased attendance in General Biology I. Our study also showed that the usage of live conferencing and digital applications increased due to the pandemic. The current research fills the gap in the existing literature by providing the first study on the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate learning and experiences in the most unique dual modality of the Spring 2020 semester.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gokhan Hacisalihoglu","author_inst":"Florida A&M University"},{"author_name":"Krysten A Jones","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sarra-Anne Azizi","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Heather M Froggatt","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Kemin Tan","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ivanova Maltseva","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Siquan Chen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vlad Nicolaescu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Steve Dvorkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kevin Furlong","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rahul S Kathayat","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mason R Firpo","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mastrodomenico","author_inst":"Loyoloa University"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Madaline M Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Munoz-Alia","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Brooke Schuster","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Nair","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"scientific communication and education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20181347","rel_title":"Correction of Daily Positivity Rates for contribution of various test protocols being used in a pandemic.","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20181347","rel_abs":"Daily positivity rates (DPR) are a popular metric to judge the prevalence of an infection in the population and the testing response to it as a single number.

Here, we explore how to leverage the increasing reliability and scale of both molecular and serological tests to balance transmission risks with economic costs involved in responding to Covid-19 epidemics. First, we introduce an optimal control approach that identifies personalized interaction rates according to an individual's test status; such that infected individuals isolate, recovered individuals can elevate their interactions, and activity of susceptible individuals varies over time. Critically, the extent to which susceptible individuals can return to work depends strongly on isolation efficiency. As we show, optimal control policies can yield mitigation policies with similar infection rates to total shutdown but lower socioeconomic costs. However, optimal control policies can be fragile given mis-specification of parameters or mis-estimation of the current disease state. Hence, we leverage insights from the optimal control solutions and propose a feedback control approach based on monitoring of the epidemic state. We utilize genetic algorithms to identify a `switching' policy such that susceptible individuals (both PCR and serological test negative) return to work after lockdowns insofar as recovered fraction is much higher than the circulating infected prevalence. This feedback control policy exhibits similar performance results to optimal control, but with greater robustness to uncertainty. Overall, our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanlin Li","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shashwat Shivam","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael E.

Accurate and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases is essential for correct medical treatment to control this pandemic. Compared with the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, chest radiography imaging techniques are shown to be more effective to detect coronavirus. For the limitation of available medical images, transfer learning is better suited to classify patterns in medical images. This paper presents a combined architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-rays. The deep transfer techniques used in this experiment are VGG19, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2. CNN is used to extract complex features from samples and classified them using RNN. The VGG19-RNN architecture achieved the best performance among all the networks in terms of accuracy and computational time in our experiments. Finally, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize class-specific regions of images that are responsible to make decision. The system achieved promising results compared to other existing systems and might be validated in the future when more samples would be available. The experiment demonstrated a good alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 for medical staff.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Providers working in our ED perceived an increase in severity and frequency of these types of presentations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A retrospective list of frequent attenders (FA) presenting five or more times to the ED between two 122-day periods were examined: 01 Mar to 30 Jun 2019 (Control) and 2020 (COVID-19). The FA group were then examined to identify patients presenting with MUS (FA-MUS). Results The total number of ED attendances during the control period was n=42,785 which reduced to n=28,806 in the COVID-19 period, a decrease of 32.7%. The control FA cohort had n=44 FA-MUS patients with 149 ED visits. This increased to n=65 FA-MUS patients with 267 visits during COVID-19, p=0.44. There was a significant increase in the proportion of all ED visits that were FA-MUS: 0.3% (control) compared to 0.9% (COVID-19); OR 2.7, p<0.001. There was a significant increase in shortness of breath amongst MUS during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the control period (p<0.01), with no significant difference in any other MUS category. Conclusion Whilst the total number of ED attendances reduced by almost one third during COVID-19, the actual number of all visits by frequent attenders with MUS increased and the proportion of attendances by these tripled during the same period. This presents an increasing challenge to ED clinicians who may feel underprepared to manage these patients effectively.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natasha Faye Daniels","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Raiiq Ridwan","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Edward BG Barnard","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Talha Muneer Amanullah","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Catherine Hayhurst","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ivanova Maltseva","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Siquan Chen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vlad Nicolaescu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Steve Dvorkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kevin Furlong","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rahul S Kathayat","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mason R Firpo","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mastrodomenico","author_inst":"Loyoloa University"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Madaline M Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Munoz-Alia","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Brooke Schuster","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Nair","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20181453","rel_title":"Phosphate levels and pulmonary damage in COVID-19 patients based on CO-RADS scheme: is there any link between parathyroid gland and COVID-19?","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20181453","rel_abs":"Background: Preliminary studies of COVID-19 have provided some evidence that electrolyte disturbances may also be present in patients. In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of the arrival electrolytes and symptoms in prediction of Lung damage in CT scan based on the CO-RADS system. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analytical study. We included patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection, June 15 to July 7. Patients were included in study if there were no previous history of kidney disease. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and CO-RADS High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of lung report were collected. Univariate logistic regression was employed first to identify the effective, correlated items. All statistics were performed with SPSS version 18.0. Results: In the current study, 36 (20 male- 16 female) patients with mean age of the 54.7 (STD:17.5) years old were studied. Most common symptom at the arrival was the Fever (52.8%), followed by Fatigue (18%), and dyspnea (44.4%). Computed tomography assessment revealed CO-RADS 2 in 4 (11.1%) patients, CO-RADS 3 in 1 (2.8%), CO-RADS 4 in 20 (55.6%), and CO-RADS 5 in 11 (30.6%) patients.

Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that only one factors was associated with HRCT damage status (Phosphorus, P=0.040). Phosphorus upper than 4.5 was associated with better HRCT results with OR ratio of 3.71 (X2(1)=5.69; p=0.017). Conclusion: Our study illustrates that higher phosphate levels may be associated with better CT scan of lung outcomes in COVID-19; while hypophosphatemia is associated with severe lung injuries. This could help clinicians to manage hospitalized patients and may link the COVID-19 and parathyroid gland.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farshid Javdani","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Shima Parsa","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Heshmatollah Shakeri","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Naser Hatami","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Navid Kalani","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Marzieh Haghbeen","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Rahim Raufi","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alireza Abbasi","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Pouyan Keshavarz","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran"},{"author_name":"Seyyed Abbas Hashemi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."},{"author_name":"Amin shafiee","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mason R Firpo","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mastrodomenico","author_inst":"Loyoloa University"},{"author_name":"Emily A Bruce","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Madaline M Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Munoz-Alia","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Brooke Schuster","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Nair","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20182048","rel_title":"Twitter Interaction to Analyze Covid-19 Impact in Ghana, Africa from March to July","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20182048","rel_abs":"Present pandemic generated by Coronavirus Covid-19 has stopped the world, from Tourism, Business, Education and more.

Disparities in social and structural determinants of health disproportionately affect those experiencing incarceration, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. Additionally, prisons are sites of congregate living, making it impossible to practice social distancing, and most prisons have relied only on incremental measures to reduce risk and spread of COVID-19. To more fully understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on incarcerated populations, it is critical to have systematic data on testing, test positivity, cases, and case fatality. Using data from the COVID Prison Project, we present data on 53 prison systems COVID-19 testing, test positivity, case, and case fatality by state and compare these data with each state's general population. Results: Many states are not reporting full information on COVID testing with some also not reporting on case fatality. Among those reporting data, there is a wide variation between testing, test positivity, and case rates within prison systems and as compared to the general population. However, when more tests are deployed more cases are identified with the majority of state prisons having higher case rates than their general population. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for the implementation and study of COVID-19 mitigation and surveillance strategies to flatten the COVID-19 curve in prisons across the country. We call for future research to build on this data from the COVID Prison Project to protect the health of our nations' often forgotten residents.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine LeMasters","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Erin McCauley","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Nowotny","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Yao Yao","author_inst":"Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies, National School of Development, Peking University, Beijing"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Vedanthan","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chenkai Wu","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Lijing L.

Methods: Seven online, text-based focus groups were conducted with a total of 42 participants. Eligible participants included adults living in Canada that prepared meals at home at least once per week. Focus groups took place from May-June 2020 and followed a semi-structured question guide. Participants were asked about their practices relating to food preparation habits at home; food purchasing, handling, and storage; hand hygiene and sanitation; and information sources about food safety concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. A thematic analysis was conducted using the Theoretical Domains Framework as a coding guide. Results: The most notable changes in behaviour since the onset of the pandemic were seen in participants' hand washing, sanitation, and grocery shopping practices. Participants tended to perceive grocery store employees, shoppers, and food service staff as having inadequate sanitation precautions and, therefore, as a source of COVID-19 transmission risk. They heavily relied on public health, medical, and government officials as sources of information. Feelings of stress and anxiety appeared to be linked to certain sanitation behaviours. Many participants displayed a general apathy toward routine food safety practices such as safe food storage at home. Conclusion: This work supports the need for clear and concise messaging for hand hygiene and food safety behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future times of crisis. It also highlights a need for ongoing food safety messaging.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robyn Haas","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Fatih Sekercioglu","author_inst":"Ryerson University"},{"author_name":"Richard Meldrum","author_inst":"Ryerson University"},{"author_name":"Ian Young","author_inst":"Ryerson University"},{"author_name":"Yao Yao","author_inst":"Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies, National School of Development, Peking University, Beijing"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Vedanthan","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chenkai Wu","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Lijing L.

Methods Epidemiological information and clinical data were collected from 35 children patients. Viral RNAs in respiratory and fecal samples were detected. Plasma of 11 patients were collected and measured for 48 cytokines. Results 40% (14\/35) of the children COVID-19 patients showed asymptomatic infections, while pneumonia shown by CT scan occurred in most of the cases (32\/35, 91.43%). Elevated LDH, AST, CRP, neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in some cases, and CD4 and CD8 counts were normal. A total of 22 cytokines were significantly higher than the healthy control, and IP-10, IFN-2 of them in children were significantly lower than the adult patients. Meanwhile, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1, and IL-1ra were similar or lower than healthy control, while significantly lower than adult patients. Viral RNAs were detected as early as the first day after illness onset (d.a.o) in both the respiratory and fecal samples. Viral RNAs decreased as the disease progression and mostly became negative in respiratory samples within 18 d.a.o, while maintained relatively stable during the disease progression and still detectable in some cases during 36~42 d.a.o. Conclusion COVID-19 in children was mild, and asymptomatic infection was common. Immune responses were relatively normal in children COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm also occurred in children patients, while much weaker than adult patients. Positive rate of viral RNAs in fecal samples was high, and profile of viral shedding were different between respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haixia Zheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Peng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinli Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanrong Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaohe Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Peng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shisong Fang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yanjie Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kai Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Xing","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengli Cao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20182170","rel_title":"Transfer learning to detect COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images, using convolutional neural networks","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20182170","rel_abs":"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that has already caused thousands of deaths and infected millions of people worldwide. Thus, all technological gadgets that allow the fast detection of COVID- 19 infection with high accuracy can offer help to healthcare professionals. This study is purposed to explore the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and reliable detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray imaging. In this study, reliable pre-trained deep learning algorithms were applied to achieve the automatic detection of COVID-19-induced pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images. Moreover, the study aims to evaluate the performance of advanced neural architectures proposed for the classification of medical images over recent years. The data set used in the experiments involves 274 COVID-19 cases, 380 viral pneumonia, and 380 healthy cases, which was derived from several open sources of X-Rays, and the data available online. The confusion matrix provided a basis for testing the post-classification model. Furthermore, an open-source library PYCM was used to support the statistical parameters. The study revealed the superiority of Model vgg16 over other models applied to conduct this research where the model performed best in terms of overall scores and based-class scores. According to the research results, deep Learning with X-ray imaging is useful in the collection of critical biological markers associated with COVID-19 infection. The technique is conducive for the physicians to make a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, the high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mundher Taresh Sr.","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Ningbo Zhu Sr.","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Talal Ahmed Ali Ali Sr.","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Jinli Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanrong Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaohe Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Peng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shisong Fang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yanjie Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kai Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Xing","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengli Cao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jason W Botten","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Susan C Baker","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Mounce","author_inst":"Loyola University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke"},{"author_name":"Bryan C Dickinson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180877","rel_title":"Interplay of antibody and cytokine production reveals CXCL-13 as a potential novel biomarker of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180877","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to impact the global population. This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the systemic cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production to Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), and Spike S1 subunit (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 develops over the first 10 to 20 days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219\/255 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient specimens, 86%) suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age were all associated with differences in antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 antigens which may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the production of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients over the course of infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-18) and chemotactic markers (IP-10, SDF-1, MIP-1{beta}, MCP-1, and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, RANTES, TNF-, GRO-, and MIP-1 relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients that succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production. Furthermore, patients that succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and also tended to have high ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies. This study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 immunity implicating the magnitude and specificity of response in relation to patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander M.

This study was aimed at the preliminary operative assessment of changes in the structure and collective dose from CT examinations in several representative hospitals, regions and on the level of the Russian Federation. The results of the study indicate that during the transformation of hospitals from general medical practice into dedicated COVID-19 facilities, the number of CT examinations increased up to 30%; the collective dose from CT exams increased up to a factor of 1.5. During a partial transformation of a medical facility into the hospital with separate COVID-19 departments, the increase in the number of CT examinations in the facility was more significant (up to a factor of 2 or more). These numbers correspond to 1.5 - 2.5 chest CT examinations (from 1 to 6) per patient admitted to hospital with COVID-19 diagnosis; and 1.2 chest CT examinations per patient in outpatient facilities, including a mandatory CT scan for the staging of COVID-19. The collective dose from CT examinations in the Russian Federation for March-June period of 2020 increased by the factor of 2 (from 16k man-Sv to 32k man-Sv); the collective dose of COVID-19 patients was about 12k man-Sv. For a more detailed and reliable assessment of the dynamics of changes in the structure of diagnostic radiology and levels of radiation exposure of patients in the Russian Federation, data collection in the regions of the Russian Federation and individual medical facilities will continue.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksandr Vodovatov","author_inst":"St-Petersburg Research Institute of Radiation Hygiene after prof.

We performed 25-color flow cytometry-analysis focusing on MNP lineages in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. While redistribution of monocytes towards intermediate subset and decrease in circulating DCs occurred in response to infection, severe disease associated with appearance of Mo-MDSC-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2. Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineage specific and in select cases associated with severe disease. Finally, unsupervised analysis revealed that the MNP profile, alone, could identify a cluster of COVID-19 non-survivors.

As of 17 August 2020, there is no specific drug or biologic agent which have been approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological findings of 211 COVID-19 in-patients that were treated between March - August 2020. Confirmation of a COVID-19 diagnosis was made according to a positive RT-PCR result with a consistent high-resolution-CT (HRCT) finding. Radiological images and the rate of clinical response of patients were investigated. Result: While 128 patients (58.7) did not develop pneumonia, the mild, moderate and severe pneumonia ratios were 28(13.2%), 31(18.7%) and 27(22.9%). 72 patients (34.1%) whose PCR tests were positive did not show any symptom and they were followed in isolation without treatment. 52 patients (24.6%) received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 57 patients (27%) received favipiravir and 30 patients (14.2%) received favipiravir plus dexamethosone as the first line of treatment. 63.1% of pneumonia patients who received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 28.3% of patients who received favipravir and 10% of patients who received favipravir plus dexamethasone showed a failure of treatment. Conclusion: The pulmonary infiltrates of COVID-19 are not infective; therefore, the characteristic of the disease should be described as COVID-19 pneumonitis instead of pneumonia. The favipiravir plus dexamethasone seems to be the only drug combination to achieve the improvement of radiological presentation and clinical symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adem Dirican","author_inst":"Samsun Medicalpark Hospital, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Samsun, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Tugce Uzar","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Irem Karaman","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aziz Uluisik","author_inst":"Samsun Liv Hospital, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Samsun, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Sevket Ozkaya","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University,Faculty of Medicine,Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Magdalini Lourda","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Majda Dzidic","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mira Akber","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Klingstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rao Muvva","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Puran Chen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Susanna Brighenti","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Norrby-Teglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Lars I.

Therefore there is great concern about the susceptibility to the outcome of COVID-19 infected patients with multiple myeloma. This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID-19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders (98 outpatinets and 538 hospitilized patinets) , collected from 10 countries by the International Myeloma Society to understand the initial challenges faced by Myeloma patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics, univariate logistic regression, and multivariate analysis were performed for hospitalized MM patinets. The median age was 69 years, and nearly all patients (96%) had MM. Approximately 36% were recently diagnosed (2019-2020), and 54% of patients were receiving first-line therapy. Thirty-three percent of patients have died, with significant geographic variability, ranging from 27% to 57% of hospitalized patients. Univariate analysis identified age, ISS3, high-risk disease, renal disease, suboptimal myeloma control (active or progressive disease), and one or more comorbidities as risk factors for higher rates of death. Neither history of transplant, including within a year of COVID-19 diagnosis nor other anti-MM treatments were associated with outcomes. Multivariate analysis found that only age, high-risk MM, renal disease, and suboptimal MM control remained independent predictors of adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. The management of MM in the era of COVID-19 requires careful consideration of patient and disease-related factors to decrease the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, while not compromising the disease control through appropriate MM treatment. This study provides the data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients at risk of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehmet K Samur","author_inst":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Martinez-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Octubre, i+12, CNIO, Complutense University, Madrid, Comunidad de Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gordon Cook","author_inst":"Leeds Institute of Clinical Trial Research & Leeds Cancer Centre, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Noa Biran","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Kwee Yong","author_inst":"Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Vania Hungria","author_inst":"Clinica Sao Germano, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Monika Engelhardt","author_inst":"Medical Department, Hematology, Oncology & Stem Cell Transplantation, Clinical Cancer Research Group, Freiburg, Faculty of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Francesca Gay","author_inst":"Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Torino, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ana Garcia-Feria","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hospital de Manises, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Stefania Oliva","author_inst":"Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Torino, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rimke Oostvogels","author_inst":"Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Gozzetti","author_inst":"University of Siena, Department of Hematology, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cara Rosenbaum","author_inst":"Center for Myeloma, New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shaji Kumar","author_inst":"The Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward A Stadtmauer","author_inst":"Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hermann Einsele","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Meral Beksac","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Katja Weisel","author_inst":"II.

Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of face mask use in a community setting and to predict the effectiveness of wearing a mask. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCISEARCH, The Cochrane Library and pre-prints from inception to 22 April 2020 without restriction by language. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane and GRADE approach. Findings: Our search identified 35 studies, including 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (4017 patients), 10 comparative studies (18984 patients), 13 predictive models, 9 laboratory experimental studies. For reducing infection rates, the estimates of cluster-RCTs were in favour of wearing face masks versus no mask, but not at statistically significant levels (adjusted OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.78-1.05). Similar findings were reported in observational studies. Mathematical models indicated an important decrease in mortality when the population mask coverage is near-universal, regardless of mask efficacy. In the best-case scenario, when the mask efficacy is at 95%, the R0 can fall to 0.99 from an initial value of 16.90. Levels of mask filtration efficiency were heterogeneous, depending on the materials used (surgical mask: 45-97%). One laboratory study suggested a viral load reduction of 0.25 (95%CI 0.09-0.67) in favour of mask versus no mask. Interpretation: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the use of face masks in a community setting. Robust randomised trials on face mask effectiveness are needed to inform evidence-based policies.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Coclite","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonello Napoletano","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Gianola","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Unita' di Epidemiologia Clinica"},{"author_name":"Andrea Del Monaco","author_inst":"Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research, Bank of Italy, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniela D'Angelo","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alice Fauci","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Iacorossi","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Latina","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe La Torre","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudio Mastroianni","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Renzi","author_inst":"University College London-UCL, Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Primiano Iannone","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cara Rosenbaum","author_inst":"Center for Myeloma, New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shaji Kumar","author_inst":"The Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward A Stadtmauer","author_inst":"Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hermann Einsele","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Meral Beksac","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Katja Weisel","author_inst":"II.

A better comprehension of SARS-CoV-2-induced monocytes death is essential for the identification of therapies capable to control the hyper-inflammation and reduce viral replication in patients with COVID-19. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis in human monocytes, experimentally infected and in patients under intensive care. Pyroptosis was dependent on caspase-1 engagement, prior to IL-1beta production and inflammatory cell death. Monocytes exposed to SARS-CoV-2 downregulate HLA-DR, suggesting a potential limitation to orchestrate the immune response.

Present study aimed to investigate the lymphocyte subset alterations with disease severity, imaging manifestation, and delayed hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Lymphocyte subsets was classified using flow cytometry with peripheral blood collected from 106 patients. Results: Multivariate logistic regression showed that chest tightness, lymphocyte count, and {gamma}-glutamyl transpeptidase were the independent predictors for severe COVID-19. The T cell, CD4+ T cell and B cell counts in severe patients were significantly lower than that in mild patients (p = 0.004, 0.003 and 0.046, respectively). Only the T cell count was gradually decreased with the increase of infiltrated quadrants of lesions in computed tomography (CT) (p = 0.043). The T cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell counts were gradually decreased with the increase of infiltrated area of the maximum lesion in CT (p = 0.002, 0.003, 0.028; respectively). The T cell count, as well as CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and NK cell counts were gradually decreased with the increased delayed hospitalization (p = 0.003, 0.002, 0.013, and 0.012; respectively). The proportion of T cell was gradually decreased but B cell was gradually increased with the increased delayed hospitalization (p = 0.031 and 0.003, respectively). Conclusion: T cell and CD4+ T cell counts negatively correlated with disease severity, CT manifestation and delayed hospitalization. CD4+ T cell was mainstay of immunity response in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Da Xian Wu","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Ping Wu","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Jian Sheng Huang","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Qun Fang Rao","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wen Feng Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Mayara Mattos","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline S Freitas","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Jairo R Temerozo","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Livia Teixeira","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Eugenio D Hottz","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute, UFJF"},{"author_name":"Ester Barreto","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Camila RR Pao","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Lohanna Palhinha","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Milene Miranda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Dumith C Bou-Habib","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"INI, D'or Institute"},{"author_name":"Patricia T Bozza","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Lopes e Souza","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute, CDTS"},{"author_name":"Kenneth C Anderson","author_inst":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria-Victoria Mateos","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca-Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain"},{"author_name":"Philippe Moreau","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, University Hospital Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM)"},{"author_name":"Jesus San-Miguel","author_inst":"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), Centro de Investigacio"},{"author_name":"Nikhil C Munshi","author_inst":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School and VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Herve Avet-Loiseau","author_inst":"25.\tCentre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Toulouse INSERM U1037, Toulouse, France, and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM)"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20182030","rel_title":"The urgent need for phased university reopenings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and conserve institutional resources: A modeling study","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20182030","rel_abs":"Introduction: Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in universities across the United States highlight the difficulties in containing the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses. While research has shown that mitigation strategies such as frequent student testing, contact tracing, and isolation of confirmed and suspected cases can detect early outbreaks, such mitigation strategies may have limited effectiveness if large outbreaks occur. A phased reopening is a practical intervention to limit early outbreaks, conserve institutional resources, and ensure proper safety protocols are in place before the return of additional students to campus. Methods: We develop dynamic compartmental transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 to assess the impact of a phased reopening and pre-arrival testing on minimizing outbreaks (measured by daily infections) and conserving university resources (measured by isolation bed capacity). We assume that one-third of the student population returns to campus each month as part of the phased reopening, and that pre-arrival testing removes 90% of infections at the semester start. We assume an on-campus population of N = 7500, an active COVID-19 prevalence of 2% at baseline, and that 60% of infected students require isolation for an average period of 11 days. We vary the reproductive number (Rt) between 1.25 and 4 to represent the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies throughout the semester, where Rt is constant or improving throughout the semester (ranging from 4 to 1.25). Results: Compared to pre-arrival testing only or neither intervention, phased reopening with pre-arrival testing reduced peak daily infections by 6% and 18% (Rt=1.25), 44% and 48% (Rt=2.5), 63% and 64% (Rt=4), and 72% and 74% (improving Rt), respectively, and reduced the proportion of on-campus beds needed for isolation from 10%-25% to 5%-9% across different values of Rt. Conclusion: Phased reopening with pre-arrival testing substantially reduces the peak number of daily infections throughout the semester and conserves university resources compared to strategies involving the simultaneous return of all students to campus. Phased reopenings allow institutions to improve safety protocols, adjust for factors that drive outbreaks, and if needed, preemptively move online before the return of additional students to campus, thus preventing unnecessary harm to students, institutional faculty and staff, and local communities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lior Rennert","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Corey Kalbaugh","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Christopher McMahan","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Lu Shi","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Christopher C Colenda","author_inst":"Wake Forest University"},{"author_name":"Wen Feng Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Mayara Mattos","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline S Freitas","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Jairo R Temerozo","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Livia Teixeira","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Eugenio D Hottz","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute, UFJF"},{"author_name":"Ester Barreto","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Camila RR Pao","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Lohanna Palhinha","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Milene Miranda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Dumith C Bou-Habib","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"INI, D'or Institute"},{"author_name":"Patricia T Bozza","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Lopes e Souza","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Institute, CDTS"},{"author_name":"Kenneth C Anderson","author_inst":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria-Victoria Mateos","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca-Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain"},{"author_name":"Philippe Moreau","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, University Hospital Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM)"},{"author_name":"Jesus San-Miguel","author_inst":"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), Centro de Investigacio"},{"author_name":"Nikhil C Munshi","author_inst":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School and VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Herve Avet-Loiseau","author_inst":"25.\tCentre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Toulouse INSERM U1037, Toulouse, France, and Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM)"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Jaochimiak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20171595","rel_title":"Multiple introductions followed by ongoing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 at one of the largest metropolitan areas in the Northeast of Brazil","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20171595","rel_abs":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population has caused a huge pandemic that is still unfolding in many countries around the world.

Although the Pernambuco state, located in the Northeast Region, is the sixth most affected brazilian state and the second considering lethality rate, there is a lack of high quality genomic sequences from the strains circulating in this region. Here, we sequenced 38 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from patients presenting Covid-19 symptoms. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that three lineages were circulating in the state and 36 samples belong to B1.1 lineage. We detected two introductions from European countries and five clades, corroborating the community spread of the virus between different municipalities of the state. Finally, we detected that all except one strain showed the D614G spike protein amino acid change that may impact virus infectivity in human cells.

This mirrors the exponential decline of thymus volume and T-cell production (decreasing by 4.5% per year). COVID-19 can therefore be added to the list of other diseases with this property, including those caused by MRSA, West Nile virus, Streptococcus Pneumonia and certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukemia and brain cancers. In addition, incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women. For under 20s, COVID-19 incidence is remarkably low. A Bayesian analysis of daily hospitalisations, accounting for contact-based and environmental transmission, indicates that non-adults are the only age group to deviate significantly from the exponential relationship. Our model fitting suggests under 20s have 53-77% additional immune protection beyond that predicted by strong thymus function alone. We found no evidence for differences between age groups in susceptibility to overall infection, or, relative infectiousness to others. The simple inverse relationship between risk and thymus size we report here suggests that therapies based on T-cell mechanisms may be a promising target.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sam Palmer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nik Cunniffe","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ruairi Donnelly","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Matheus Filgueira Bezerra","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Filipe Zimmer Dezordi","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Lais Ceschini Machado","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Larissa Krokovsky","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Elisama Helvecio","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Freitas da Silva","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Luydson Richardson Silva Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Antonio Mauro Rezende","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Severino Jefferson Ribeiro da Silva","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Kamila Gaudencio da Silva Sales","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Bruna Santos Lima Figueiredo de Sa","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Derciliano Lopes da Cruz","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Claudio Eduardo Cavalcanti","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Armando de Menezes Neto","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Caroline Targino Alves da Silva","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Renata Pessoa Germano Mendes","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Maria Almerice Lopes da Silva","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Michelle da Silva Barros","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Wheverton Ricardo Correia do Nascimento","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Moraes Loyo Arcoverde","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Luciane Caroline Albuquerque Bezerra","author_inst":"Secretaria de Saude de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Sinval Pinto Brandao Filho","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Constancia Flavia Junqueira Ayres","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Luz Wallau","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Sava\u015f Tay","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.25.20154252","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2-RNA viremia is associated to hypercytokinemia and critical illness in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.25.20154252","rel_abs":"Background: Severe COVID-19 is characterized by clinical and biological manifestations typically observed in sepsis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is commonly detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, however viral RNA can be found also in peripheral blood and other tissues. Whether systemic spreading of the virus or viral components plays a role in the pathogenesis of the sepsis like disease observed in severe COVID-19 is currently unknown. Methods: We determined the association of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the biological responses and the clinical severity of patients with COVID-19. 250 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalised ward patients, and 100 critically ill). The association between plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA and laboratory parameters was evaluated using multivariate GLM with a gamma distribution. The association between plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severity was evaluated using multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analysis with a binomial distribution. Results: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA viremia was independently associated with a number of features consistently identified in sepsis: 1) high levels of cytokines (including CXCL10, CCL-2, IL-10, IL-1ra, IL-15, and G-CSF); 2) higher levels of ferritin and LDH; 3) low lymphocyte and monocyte counts 4) and low platelet counts. In hospitalised patients, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA viremia was independently associated with critical illness: (adjusted OR= 8.30 [CI95%=4.21-16.34], p < 0.001). CXCL10 was the most accurate identifier of SARS-CoV-2-RNA viremia in plasma (area under the curve (AUC), [CI95%], p) = 0.85 [0.80 0.89), <0.001]), suggesting its potential role as a surrogate biomarker of viremia. The cytokine IL-15 most accurately differentiated clinical ward patients from ICU patients (AUC: 0.82 [0.76 0.88], <0.001). Conclusions: systemic dissemination of genomic material of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a sepsis-like biological response and critical illness in patients with COVID-19. RNA viremia could represent an important link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, host response dysfunction and the transition from moderate illness to severe, sepsis-like COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":63,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesus F Bermejo-Martin","author_inst":"Group for Biomedical Research in Sepsis (BioSepsis).

The State of Michigan reports over 80,000 positive COVID-19 tests between March 1, 2020 and July 29, 2020. We surveyed 8,047 Michigan Medicine biorepository participants in late June 2020. We found that 58% of COVID-19 cases reported no known exposure to family members or to someone outside the house diagnosed with COVID-19. A significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases were employed as essential workers (45% vs 19%, p=3x10-11). COVID-19 cases reporting a fever were more likely to require hospitalization (categorized as severe; OR = 4.6 [95% CI: 1.7-13.0, p=0.004]) whereas respondents reporting rhinorrhea was less likely to require hospitalization (categorized as mild-to-moderate; OR = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.04-0.70, p=0.016]). African-Americans reported higher rates of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR = 4.0 [95% CI: 2.2-7.2, p=1x10-4]), as well as higher rates of exposure to family or someone outside the household diagnosed with COVID-19, an annual household income < $40,000, living in rental housing, and chronic diseases. During the Executive Order in Michigan, African Americans, women, and the lowest income group reported worsening health behaviors and higher overall concern for the potential detrimental effects of the pandemic. The higher risk of contracting COVID-19 observed among African Americans may be due to the increased rates of working as essential employees, lower socioeconomic status, and exposure to known positive cases. Continued efforts should focus on COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies, as well as address the inequality gaps that result in higher risks for both short-term and long-term health outcomes.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kuan-Han H Wu","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Whitney E Hornsby","author_inst":"Michigan Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bethany Klunder","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Amelia Krause","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Anisa Driscoll","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"John Kulka","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryan Bickett-Hickok","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Austin Fellows","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sarah Graham","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Erin O Kaleba","author_inst":"eokaleba@med.umich.edu"},{"author_name":"Salim S Hayek","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Xu Shi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nadia R Sutton","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Douville","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Jamerson","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chad M Brummett","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Cristen J Willer","author_inst":"cristen@umich.edu"},{"author_name":"Gregoria Megias","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Hospital Universitario de Burgos, Spain."},{"author_name":"Montserrat Gonzalez-Estecha","author_inst":"Biochemistry Service, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Demetrio Carriedo","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit.

Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United States. Methods Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients. Results Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 49.5-71.5]; 35.1% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1%), and diabetes (54; 41.2%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2%) required MV and 9 (6.9%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p= 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p< 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p< 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p < 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8% and 23.8% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality rates were 21.6% and 26.5% respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrates an important improvement in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 who required ICU admission and MV in comparison to previous observational reports and emphasize the importance of standard of care measures in the management of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eduardo Oliveira","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Amay Parikh","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Arnaldo Lopez-Ruiz","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Maria Carrillo","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Joshua Goldberg","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Martin Cearras","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Khaled Fernainy","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Sonja Andersen","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Luis Mercado","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Jian Guan","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Hammad Zafar","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Patricia Louzon","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Amy Carr","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Natasha Baloch","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Richard Pratley","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Scott Silvestry","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Vincent Hsu","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Jason Sniffen","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Victor Herrera","author_inst":"Adventhealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Neil Finkler","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Demetrio Carriedo","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the cases admitted in our high dependency and Intensive care unit and tried to pinpoint the major cause of mortality in our cases. Methods: This is a single center retrospective study carried out at Bahria International Hospital Lahore over a 3 month period (May 10th to July 10th 2020) in which we analyzed the clinical and biochemical profiles of the COVID-19 patients who died during this period. Results: A total of 108 patients were admitted during this period out of which 11 patients died. 7 of them were men and 4 women. Majority of them had sudden cardiac arrest due to acute coronary syndrome followed by multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusion: Acute coronary syndrome due to hypercoagubility was the leading cause of death in our patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Asim Rana","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Ahad Qayyum","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Mubashar Sultan Hashmi","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muneeb Ullah Saif","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Faisal Munir","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Mansoor Hafeez","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan, Lahore, PAK"},{"author_name":"Khaled Fernainy","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Sonja Andersen","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Luis Mercado","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Jian Guan","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Hammad Zafar","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Patricia Louzon","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Amy Carr","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Natasha Baloch","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Richard Pratley","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Scott Silvestry","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Vincent Hsu","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Jason Sniffen","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Victor Herrera","author_inst":"Adventhealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Neil Finkler","author_inst":"AdventHealth Orlando"},{"author_name":"Demetrio Carriedo","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit.
