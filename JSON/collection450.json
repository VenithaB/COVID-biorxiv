We performed longitudinal immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 patients and healthy donors. We observed a dynamic immune landscape of innate and adaptive immune cells in disease progression and absolute changes of lymphocyte and myeloid cells in severe versus mild cases or healthy controls. Intubation and death were coupled with selected natural killer cell KIR receptor usage and IgM+ B cells and associated with profound CD4 and CD8 T cell exhaustion. Pseudo-temporal reconstruction of the hierarchy of disease progression revealed dynamic time changes in the global population recapitulating individual patients and the development of an eight-marker classifier of disease severity. Estimating the effect of clinical progression on the immune response and early assessment of disease progression risks may allow implementation of tailored therapies.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre F Rendeiro","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Joseph Casano","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Charles Kyriakos Vorkas","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Harjot Singh","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Ayana Morales","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert A DeSimone","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Grant B Ellsworth","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Soave","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shashi N Kapadia","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kohta Saito","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Brown","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"JingMei Hsu","author_inst":"Division of Hematology\/Oncology, Department of Medicine Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10065, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Kyriakides","author_inst":"Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Steven Chui","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Luca Cappelli","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Cacciapuoti","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Wayne Tam","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Galluzzi","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Paul D Simonson","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190496","rel_title":"Systematic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG epitopes at single amino acid resolution","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190496","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG responses play critical roles for patients to recover from COVID-19, in-depth dissecting of the IgG responses on systems level is of great interest.

Understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance to be able to respond to outbreaks and take action against spread of the disease. Transmission within the household is a concern, especially because infection control is difficult to apply within the household domain. Methods We used comprehensive administrative register data from Denmark, comprising the full population and all COVID-19 tests, to estimate household transmission risk and attack rate. Results We studied the testing dynamics for COVID-19 and found that the day after receiving a positive test result within the household, 35% of potential secondary cases were tested and 13% of these were positive. After a primary case in 6,782 households, 82% of potential secondary cases were tested within 14 days, of which 17% tested positive as secondary cases, implying an attack rate of 17%. Among primary cases, those aged 0-24 were underrepresented when compared with the total population. We found an approximately linearly increasing relationship between attack rate and age. We investigated the transmission risk from primary cases by age, and found an increasing risk with age of primary cases for adults, while the risk seems to decrease with age for children. Conclusions Although there is an increasing attack rate and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 with age, children are also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 within the household.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederik Plesner Lyngse","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Carsten Thure Kirkeby","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Tariq Halasa","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Viggo Andreasen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Robert Leo Skov","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Frederik Trier M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Tyra Grove Krause","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"K\u00e5re M\u00f8lbak","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Zi-wen Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Chuang-sheng Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20188961","rel_title":"Effect of Screen time on Glycaemic control of Type 2 Diabetes patients during COVID-19 Outbreak: A Survey based Study","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20188961","rel_abs":"Introduction: Decreased workout during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a serious issue for the patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), since their glycaemic control is very much related to that. COVID-19 has posed a severe health issue that is playing havoc on the aged patients with existing comorbidities. Studies have shown mixed reports of social media on T2DM, with some showing positive results due to increased use of apps and adherence to lifestyle, while others have shown adiposity and glycaemic control related to hours spent on-screen time in children. Data on adult T2DM patients screen time activity and prevailing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and, post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) is sparse. Aim: To study the effect of screen-time spent on social media per day on glycaemic parameters of T2DM patients. Materials and methods: Data was collected for T2DM patients giving informed written consent and meeting a set of pre-specified inclusion criteria. Through two rounds of surveys done from May 15 to June 26, the authors collected the answers to a set of questionnaires from a total of 344 patients sent via email. Due to the non-availability of data from a few patients, a total of 229 patients data were finally analyzed. SPSS software version V21 was used to perform Binary logistic regression for calculating the odds ratio (OR) of the categorical variables. The outcomes, looked for in the analysis, were poor control of glycaemic parameters like HbA1c (defined by >7%), FBS (defined by >150 mg\/dL) and, PPBS (defined by >200 mg\/dL) and the exposure variables were Screen time spent by the person per day for all the three glycaemic parameters and, doctors visit and, daily exercise for HbA1c outcome. Results: A total of 173 patients had a screen time (henceforth, it means time spent on social media) of less than 2 hours\/day in the study sample. Among the 173 patients, 73 (42.2%) had achieved HbA1c less than 7%, whereas the remaining 100 (57.8%) had HbA1c more than 7%. On the other hand, 56 patients had a screen time of more than 2 hours, of which 44 (72.73%) had HbA1c more than 7%. Among the 173 patients, only 89 (51.44%) had an FBS value of more than 150 mg\/dL as compared to 46 (82.12%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. Out of these 173 patients, only 43 (24.86%) had a PPBS value of more than 200 mg\/dL as compared to 41 (73.21%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. It was found that the odds of having a poor glycaemic control as per HbA1c, FBS and PPBS is 2.67 times higher (95%CI: 1.91-6.95), 4.34 times higher (95%CI: 1.52-4.76) and, 8.26 times higher (95%CI: 4.26-11.83) in the cohort with a screen time of more than 2 hours as compared to the cohort with a screen time of less than 2 hours, respectively. Conclusion: There seems to be an increased risk of uncontrolled glycaemic indices with increased screen time and, decreased work out. This is a small study and the findings need to be corroborated with larger sample size.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sayak Roy","author_inst":"Medica Superspeciality Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kingshuk Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Medwes Pvt LTD, Kolkata, Wb, India"},{"author_name":"Tariq Halasa","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Viggo Andreasen","author_inst":"Roskilde University"},{"author_name":"Robert Leo Skov","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Frederik Trier M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Tyra Grove Krause","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"K\u00e5re M\u00f8lbak","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Zi-wen Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Chuang-sheng Hu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190421","rel_title":"Massachusetts General Hospital Covid-19 Registry reveals two distinct populations of hospitalized patients by race and ethnicity","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190421","rel_abs":"Objective: To evaluate differences by race\/ethnicity in clinical characteristics and outcomes among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Methods: The MGH Covid-19 Registry includes confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized at MGH and is based on manual chart reviews and data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs). We evaluated differences between White\/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N=866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020 - May 4, 2020. Results: Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black\/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White\/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)]. Hispanic patients were symptomatic longer before presenting to care (median 5 vs 3d, p=0.039) but were more likely to be sent home with self-quarantine than be admitted to hospital (29% vs 16%, p<0.001). Hispanic patients had fewer comorbidities yet comparable rates of ICU or death (34% vs 36%). Nonetheless, a greater proportion of Hispanic patients recovered by 14 days after presentation (62% vs 45%, p<0.001; OR = 1.99, p = 0.011 in multivariable adjusted model) and fewer died (2% versus 18%, p<0.001). Conclusions: Hospitalized Hispanic patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities compared to White\/non-Hispanic patients; despite comparable rates of ICU care or death, a greater proportion recovered. These results have implications for public health policy and the design and conduct of clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ingrid V Bassett","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Virgina A Triant","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bridget A Bunda","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caitlin A Selvaggi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Shinnick","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Frances Lu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bianca C Porneala","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tingyi Cao","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven A Lubitz","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"James B Meigs","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Hsu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea S Foulkes","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-dong Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hua Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Olivier Elemento","author_inst":"Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Inghirami","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.289892","rel_title":"Initial insights into the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala suggest local spread from limited introductions","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.289892","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread from a city in China to almost every country in the world, affecting millions of individuals. Genomic approaches have been extensively used to understand the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 across the world. Kerala is a unique state in India well connected with the rest of the world through a large number of expatriates, trade, and tourism. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported in Kerala in January 2020, during the initial days of the pandemic. The rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases in the state of Kerala has necessitated the understanding of the genetic epidemiology of circulating virus, evolution, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2. We sequenced a total of 200 samples from patients at a tertiary hospital in Kerala using COVIDSeq protocol at a mean coverage of 7,755X. The analysis identified 166 unique high-quality variants encompassing 4 novel variants and 89 new variants identified for the first time in SARS-CoV-2 samples isolated from India. Phylogenetic and haplotype analysis revealed that the circulating population of the virus was dominated (94.6% of genomes) by three distinct introductions followed by local spread, apart from identifying polytomies suggesting recent outbreaks. The genomes formed a monophyletic distribution exclusively mapping to the A2a clade. Further analysis of the functional variants revealed two variants in the S gene of the virus reportedly associated with increased infectivity and 5 variants that mapped to five primer\/probe binding sites that could potentially compromise the efficacy of RT-PCR detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive report of genetic epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chandni Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Medical College PO, Kozhikode Kerala, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Mohit Kumar Divakar","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Jain","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Prasanth Viswanathan","author_inst":"Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Medical College PO, Kozhikode Kerala, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Rahul C.

Here, we identified host cell membrane protein candidates that were present in proximity to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins through the use of proximity labeling and proteomics analysis. The identified proteins represent candidate key factors that may be required for viral entry. Our results indicated that a number of membrane proteins, including DPP4, Cadherin-17, and CD133, were identified to co-localize with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2 cells that were used to expand the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine\/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.\n\nAuthor summaryIncreased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 particularly in minority groups.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Holcomb","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Aikaterini Alexaki","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Nancy Hernandez","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Kyle Laurie","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Jacob Kames","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Nobuko Hamasaki-Katagiri","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Anton A.

Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8\/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8\/A9 and noncanonical neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qirui Guo","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yingchi Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Junhong Li","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese"},{"author_name":"Jiangning Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese"},{"author_name":"Fuping You","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xuefei Guo","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Zeming Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Lili Cao","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yujie Luo","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Wei","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Luoying Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Systems Biomedicine, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tumor Systems Biology, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Hua Zhu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Ran Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Ilayda Tolu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Esra Ayan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Busra Yuksel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ayse Buket Peksen","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oktay Gocenler","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls.\n\nMethodsWe used two publicly available gene expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were also determined.\n\nResultsWe found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription.

Virus utilizes multiple receptors for attachment, entry, or specific host responses. However, other than ACE2, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Furthermore, ACE2 cannot easily interpret the multi-organ tropisms of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To identify host cell receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 interactions, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen almost all human membrane proteins, with SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein as the target. Twelve receptors were identified, including ACE2. Most receptors bind at least two domains on S protein, the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and the N-terminal-domain (NTD), suggesting both are critical for virus-host interaction. Ectopic expression of ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient to enable entry of SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Analyzing single-cell transcriptome profiles from COVID-19 patients revealed that virus susceptibility in airway epithelial ciliated and secretory cells and immune macrophages highly correlates with expression of ACE2, KREMEN1 and ASGR1 respectively, and ACE2\/ASGR1\/KREMEN1 (ASK) together displayed a much better correlation than any individual receptor. Based on modeling of systemic SARS-CoV-2 host interactions through S receptors, we revealed ASK correlation with SARS-CoV-2 multi-organ tropism and provided potential explanations for various COVID-19 symptoms. Our study identified a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptors with diverse binding properties, biological functions, and clinical correlations or implications, including ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as the alternative entry receptors, providing insights into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with host, as well as a useful resource and potential drug targets for COVID-19 investigation.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunqing Gu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Cao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinyu Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hai Gao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jia Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jinlan Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guanghui Shen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xichen Zheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianqing Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Lan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Min Luo","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Khatendra Reang","author_inst":"Hislop College, Biochemistry Department, Chitnavis Centre, Temple Rd, Dobhi Nagar, Civil Lines, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440001."},{"author_name":"Akadiri Olalekan","author_inst":"Biotechnology, Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi Lagos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

Given the panoply of potential COVID-19 diagnostic tools and therapeutic candidates that require purified spike protein and its importance for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research, we have explored new approaches for spike production and purification. Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHOBRI\/rcTA cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated\/stabilized form (to favor expression of the full-length spike in prefusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg\/L. The speed and productivity of this method support further development of CHO-based approaches for recombinant spike protein manufacturing.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Stuible","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Simon Lord-Dufour","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Perret","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Joseph Schrag","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Gilles St-Laurent","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Yves Durocher","author_inst":"National Research Council Canada"},{"author_name":"Guanghui Shen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xichen Zheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianqing Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Lan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Min Luo","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Khatendra Reang","author_inst":"Hislop College, Biochemistry Department, Chitnavis Centre, Temple Rd, Dobhi Nagar, Civil Lines, Nagpur, Maharashtra 440001."},{"author_name":"Akadiri Olalekan","author_inst":"Biotechnology, Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi Lagos, Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike\/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these results with the current mutational status of these amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 10 distinct patients: N439K, G476S, S477N and N501Y. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V.\n\nSignificance StatementWe developed a method to identify key amino acids responsible for the initial interaction between SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and human cells, through the analysis of Spike\/ACE2 complexes. We further identified which of these amino acids show variants in the viral and human populations. Our results will facilitate scientists and clinicians alike in identifying the possible role of present and future Spike and ACE2 sequence variants in cell entry and general susceptibility to infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Ortuso","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University \"Magna Graecia\" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Mercatelli","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Hiram Guzzi","author_inst":"Department of Surgical and Medical Sciences, University \"Magna Graecia\" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Manuel Giorgi","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sai D Prasad","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Srinivas Vellimudu","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Krishna M Ella","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Rajaram Ravikrishnan","author_inst":"RCC Labs"},{"author_name":"Amit Awasthi","author_inst":"THSTI"},{"author_name":"Jomy Jose","author_inst":"RCC Labs"},{"author_name":"Panduranga Rao","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kumar","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Raches Ella","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech International Limited"},{"author_name":"Priya Abraham","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology, Pune"},{"author_name":"Pragya Yadav","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Gajanan N Sapkal","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Anita Shete","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Gururaj Rao Desphande","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Sreelekshmy Mohandas","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Atanu Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

We pre-registered our hypothesis that the intense experience of the outbreak potentially induced stress-related brain modifications5-8. Volumetric changes in n = 50 participants scanned before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, were compared with n = 50 control participants that were scanned twice prior to the pandemic. The pandemic provided a rare opportunity to examine brain plasticity in a natural experiment. We found volumetric increases in bilateral amygdalae, putamen, and the anterior temporal cortices. Changes in the amygdalae diminished as time elapsed from lockdown relief, suggesting that the intense experience associated with the pandemic outbreak induced volumetric changes in brain regions commonly associated with stress and anxiety9-11.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Salomon","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Adi Cohen","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gal Ben-Zvi","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rani Gera","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shiran Oren","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dana Roll","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gal Rozic","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Saliy","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Niv Tik","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Galia Tsarfati","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, affiliated to the Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ido Tavor","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tom Schonberg","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yaniv Assaf","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Priya Abraham","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology, Pune"},{"author_name":"Pragya Yadav","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Gajanan N Sapkal","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Anita Shete","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Gururaj Rao Desphande","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Sreelekshmy Mohandas","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Atanu Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to show that ACE2 orthologs from 24, 21, and 16 of 46 phylogenetically diverse bat species - including those in close and distant contact with humans - do not support entry of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and both of these coronaviruses, respectively. Furthermore, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify genetic changes in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions.

Efficient replication of the virus relies on the activity of nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), a major virulence factor shown to facilitate suppression of host gene expression through promotion of host mRNA degradation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Here, we report the crystal structure of the globular domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, encompassing residues 13 to 127, at a resolution of 1.65 [A]. Our structure features a six-stranded, capped {beta}-barrel motif similar to Nsp1from SARS-CoV and reveals how variations in amino acid sequence manifest as distinct structural features. Through comparative analysis of structural homologues, we identified a topological signature associated with this protein fold that facilitated modeling of Nsp1 from MERS-CoV. Combining our high-resolution crystal structure with existing data on the C-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, we propose a model of the full-length protein. Our results provide unparalleled insight into the molecular structure of a major pathogenic determinant of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cameron Semper","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Nobihiko Watanabe","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Alexei Savchenko","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ming Guo","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bing-Jun Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan university"},{"author_name":"Huabin Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ido Tavor","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tom Schonberg","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yaniv Assaf","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Priya Abraham","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology, Pune"},{"author_name":"Pragya Yadav","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Gajanan N Sapkal","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Anita Shete","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Gururaj Rao Desphande","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Sreelekshmy Mohandas","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Atanu Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

The statistical relationships of total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths per million populations in these countries with 10 demographic, economic and social indicators (indices) were studied. These indicators are Life Expectancy, Median Age, Growth Rate, Population Density, GDP PPP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), Gini index of income equality, Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and Democracy Index. Statistically significant relationships were found with all indicators excluding Gini index and Population Density. We have found that the closest is the relationship of Deaths per million population and total Cases per million population with correlation coefficient R = 0.926. Therefore, it is clear statistically that the more are Cases per million in a country the more are Deaths per million. This confirms the correctness of the timely and effective introduction of the necessary pandemic restrictions in the countries. It is interesting that the close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a purely economic index like GDP PPP per capita, where R = 0.687 and R = 0.660, respectively. Even more close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a composite index HDI, where the correlation coefficients reach 0.724 and 0.680, respectively. This paradoxical results show that the richest and well-being countries are most seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most probable reason for this is the large percentage of aging population, comorbidity of population with severe chronic diseases and obesity in countries with high GDP and HDI. No less important reason appears the delayed and\/or insufficiently effective pandemic restrictions in these countries, which have underestimated the danger of a pandemic in early stage. Other indicators (excluding Gini index and Population Density) also show statistically significant correlations with Cases and Deaths per 1 million with correlation coefficients from 0.432 to 0.634. The countries that deviates the most from the regression lines were shown. Surprisingly, there was no statistically significant correlation between Cases and Deaths with Population Density. The statistical significance of the found correlations determined using Student's t-test was p <0.0001. The countries that deviate the most from both sides of the regression line were shown. It has been shown that the correlations of COVID-19 cases and Deaths with the studied indicators decrease with time.

Proactive testing of asymptomatic individuals is therefore a powerful, and probably necessary, tool for preventing widespread infection in many settings. This paper explores the effectiveness of alternative testing regimes, in which the frequency, the accuracy, and the delay between testing and results determine the time path of infection. For a simple model of disease transmission, we present analytic formulas that determine the effect of testing on the expected number of days of during which an infectious individual is exposed to the population at large. This allows us to estimate the frequency of testing that would be required to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks, and to explore the trade-offs between frequency, accuracy, and delay in achieving this objective. We conclude by discussing applications to outbreak control on college and university campuses.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ted Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Carl T.

This picture contrasts with the discrete representation of n and t underlying the real epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for which a description based on finite difference equations would be more adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position Tc1\/2 obtained within the continuous time representation is systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position Td1\/2 predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift {tau} {equiv} Tc1\/2 - Td1\/2 < 0 is basically insensitive to changes in infection rate {kappa}. For a broad range of {kappa} values deduced from COVID-19 data at extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we found a rather robust estimate {tau} {approx} -2.65 day-1. Being obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results apply to logistic growth in general without any limitation to a specific real system.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioan Baldea","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Carl T.

Aim: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG among COVID-19 Thai patients with different severity. Methods: We used plasma from 118 adult patients who have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 49 patients under investigation without infection, 20 patients with other respiratory infections, and 102 healthy controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from Euroimmun. The optical density ratio cut off for positive test was 1.1 for IgA and 0.8 for IgG. The association of antibody response with the severity of diseases and the day of symptoms was performed. Results: From Mar 10 to May 31, 2020, 289 participants were enrolled, and 384 samples were analyzed. Patients were categorized by clinical manifestations to mild (n=59), moderate (n=27) and severe (n=32). The overall sensitivity of IgA and IgG from samples collected after day 7 is 87.9% (95% CI 79.8-93.6) and 84.8% (95% CI 76.2-91.3), respectively. The severe group had a significantly higher level of specific IgA and IgG to S1 antigen compared to the mild group. All moderate to severe patients have specific IgG while 20% of the mild group did not have any IgG detected after two weeks. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was significantly higher in males compared to females among the severe group (p=0.003). Conclusion: The serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 has high sensitivity after the second week after onset of illness. Serological response differs among patients with different severity and different sex.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ekasit Kowitdamrong","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Thanyawee Puthanakit","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Watsamon Jantarabenjakul","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Eakachai Prompetchara","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Pintip Suchartlikitwong","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Opass Putcharoen","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Nattiya Hirankarn","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan university"},{"author_name":"Huabin Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ido Tavor","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tom Schonberg","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yaniv Assaf","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Priya Abraham","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology, Pune"},{"author_name":"Pragya Yadav","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Gajanan N Sapkal","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Anita Shete","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Gururaj Rao Desphande","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Sreelekshmy Mohandas","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Atanu Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

Objective To determine whether the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality are associated with ethnicity. Data Sources We searched all English language articles published 1st December 2019 - 30th June 2020 within MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROSPERO and the Cochrane library using indexing terms for COVID-19 and ethnicity, as well as manuscripts awaiting peer review on MedRxiv during the same period. Study Selection Included studies reported original clinical data, disaggregated by ethnicity, on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. We excluded correspondence, area level, modelling and basic science articles. Two independent reviewers screened articles for inclusion. Of 926 identified articles, 35 were included in the meta-analyses. Data Extraction and Synthesis The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Reviewers independently extracted data using a piloted form on: (1) rates of infection, ICU admission and mortality by ethnicity; and (2) unadjusted and adjusted data comparing ethnic minority and White groups. Data were pooled using random effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were: (1) infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed on molecular testing; (2) ICU admission; and (3) mortality in COVID-19 confirmed and suspected cases. Results 13,535,562 patients from 35 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Black, Asian and Hispanic individuals had a greater risk of infection compared to White individuals (Black: pooled adjusted RR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.59-2.67; Asian: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59; Hispanic: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.39-2.25). Black individuals were significantly more likely to be admitted to ICU than White individuals (pooled adjusted RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02-2.55). Risk of mortality was similar across ethnicities among hospitalised patients, but increased among Asian and Mixed ethnic groups in the general population. Conclusions Black, Asian and Hispanic ethnic groups are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Black individuals may be more likely to require ICU admission for COVID-19. There may also be disparities in risk of death from COVID-19 at a population level. Our findings are of critical public health importance and should inform policy on minimising SARS-CoV-2 exposure in ethnic minority groups.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shirley Sze","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Daniel Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Laura J Gray","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Clareece R Nevill","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Christopher A Martin","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Joshua Nazareth","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Jatinder S Minhas","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Pip Divall","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Keith Abrams","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Laura B Nellums","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Yaniv Assaf","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Priya Abraham","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology, Pune"},{"author_name":"Pragya Yadav","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Gajanan N Sapkal","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Anita Shete","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Gururaj Rao Desphande","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Sreelekshmy Mohandas","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Atanu Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Virology-Indian Council of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

As immune responses are in part regulated by metabolites, we examined whether the serum metabolome has sex-specificity for immune responses in COVID-19. In males with COVID- 19, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA to kynurenine (K) ratio was positively correlated with age, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and was negatively correlated with T cell responses, revealing that KA production is linked to immune responses in males. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K ratio than those that stabilized. In females with COVID-19, this ratio positively correlated with T cell responses and did not correlate with age or clinical severity. KA is known to inhibit glutamate release, and we observed that serum glutamate is lower in patients that deteriorate from COVID-19 compared to those that stabilize, and correlates with immune responses. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data revealed that expression of kynurenine aminotransferase, which regulates KA production, correlates most strongly with cytokine levels and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes, in COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuping Cai","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Kim","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takehiro Takahashi","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David I Broadhurst","author_inst":"Centre for Integrative Metabolomics & Computational Biology, School of Science, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, 6027, Australia"},{"author_name":"Shuangge Ma","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J.W Rattray","author_inst":"Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow G4 0RE, UK."},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine;Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale University School of Medic"},{"author_name":"Jon Klein","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Lucas","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Mao","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Moore","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Catherine M Muenker","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Julio Silva","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wong","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Yale IMPACT Research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Albert J Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

We hypothesized that they might be of particular relevance to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Objectives: To assess the involvement of the Activin-Follistatin-axis in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Methods: Levels of Activins -A, -B and their physiological inhibitor Follistatin, were retrospectively analyzed in 314 serum samples from 117 COVID-19 patients derived from two independent centers and compared with common demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Optimal-scaling with ridge-regression was used to screen variables and establish a prediction model. Main Results: The Activin\/Follistatin-axis was significantly deregulated during the course of COVID-19 and was independently associated with severity and in-hospital mortality. FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel disease scoring system, adding one point for each of Follistatin >6235 pg\/ml, Activin-A >591 pg\/ml, Activin-B >249 pg\/ml, CRP >10.3 mg\/dL, LDH >427 U\/L, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, Neutrophil\/Lymphocyte-Ratio >5.6, Years of Age >61, Comorbidities >1 and D-dimers >1097 ng\/ml, efficiently predicted and monitored fatal outcome independently of multiplicity and timing of sampling (AUC: 0.951{+\/-}0.032, p<10-6). Validation in 35 samples derived from a third hospital indicated comparable AUC (0.958{+\/-}0.086, p=0.032). Conclusion: This study unravels the link between Activin\/Folistatin-axis and COVID-19 mortality and introduces FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel pathophysiology-based tool that copes with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of COCVID-19, predicts disease outcome and supports clinical decision making. Prospective large-scale validation of this calculator, as well as investigation of the mechanisms linking Activin\/Folistatin-axis to COVID-19 pathogenesis is warranted.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evgenia Synolaki","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vasileios Papadopoulos","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Georgios Divolis","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Efstratios Gavriilidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Georgia Loli","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Arriana Gavriil","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace,  Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Olga Tsachouridou","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Eleni Sertaridou","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Petros Rafailidis","author_inst":"Second Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Arja Pasternack","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Boumpas","author_inst":"4th Department of Medicine, \"Attikon\" University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Olli Ritvos","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Symeon Metalidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine , AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Skendros","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Sideras","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sajid A Khan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine;Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline H Johnson","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nievedita Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, India"},{"author_name":"Krishna Vadrevu Mohan","author_inst":"Bharat Biotech"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Carl","author_inst":"Scailyte AG, Industriestrasse 12, 6210 Sursee, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Ali Doga Yucel","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Ozgur Can","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Serena Ozabrahamyan","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Alpsu Olkan","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Ece Erdemoglu","author_inst":"Bahcesehir University"},{"author_name":"Fulya Aksit","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Haci Tanisali","author_inst":"Koc University"},{"author_name":"Oleksandr M.

Purpose: To summarize evidence about the effect of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19. Data sources: PubMed (via MEDLINE), Scopus, and medRxiv repository databases from 1 January to 21 August 2020. Study Selection: Observational studies in any language reporting efficacy and safety outcomes of TCZ use in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Data Extraction: Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments. Data synthesis: Of 57 eligible studies, 27 were controlled and 30 were not. The overall included patients were 8,128: 4,021 treated with TCZ, in addition to standard of care (SOC), and 4,107 only receiving SOC. The pooled mortality was lower in the TCZ-group vs. the control group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.73 (95%CI 0.57-0.93; p=0.010). The overall NNT to avoid one death was 20. In hospital wards, patients in the TCZ-group were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) in a higher proportion than those in the control group; however, ICU mortality of the TCZ-group was lower than in the control group. Secondary infections occurred in a higher proportion in TCZ-treated patients. Among survivors, the length of stay was similar in both groups. Limitations: Conclusions should be considered as weak evidence since they are based on observational studies, most of them retrospective. A variety of factors influencing the indication and effect of TCZ could not be evaluated in-depth. Conclusions: TCZ seems beneficial in preventing in-hospital mortality in severe, non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Conversely, patients receiving TCZ appear to be at higher risk for secondary infections, especially those admitted to ICU.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Bellvitge University Hospital, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute-IDIBELL, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose M.

This study aimed to examine the characteristic of repositive COVID-19 cases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase and gray literature up to August 17, 2020. A random-effects model was applied to obtain the pooled prevalence of RNA repositive among recovered patients and the prevalence of subjects underlying comorbidity among recurrence cases. The other characteristics were calculated based on the summary data of individual studies. Results: A total of 37 studies were included in the final analysis, we have described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence cases. Of 2,436 patients recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged, an estimate of 16% (95% CI, 12% to 20%) patients was repositive with SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up. This proportion was 15% (95% CI, 11% to 18%) for China and 31% (95% CI, 26% to 37%) for Korea. Among recurrence cases, it was estimated 43% (95% CI, 31% to 55%) subjects underlying at least one comorbidity. The estimates for times from disease onset to admission, from admission to discharge, and from discharge to RNA positive conversion were 17.3, 16.7, and 10.5 days, respectively. Conclusions: This study summarized up-to-date evidence from case reports, case series, and observational studies for the characteristic of COVID-19 recurrence cases after discharge. It is recommended to pay attention to follow-up patients after discharge, even if they have been in quarantine.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tung Hoang","author_inst":"Duy Tan University"},{"author_name":"Jose M.
