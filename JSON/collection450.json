The use of appropriate experimental animal models remains central in the in-vivo exploration of the physiopathology of infection and antiviral strategies. This study describes SARS-CoV-2 intra-nasal infection in ferrets and hamsters with low doses of low-passage SARS-CoV-2 clinical French isolate UCN19, describing infection levels, excretion, immune responses and pathological patterns in both animal species. Individual infection with 103 pfu SARS-CoV-2 induced a more severe disease in hamsters than in ferrets. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of hamsters but not of ferrets and in the brain (olfactive and\/or spinal bulbs) of both species. Overall, the clinical disease remained mild, with serological responses detected from 7 days and 10 days post inoculation in hamsters and ferrets respectively. Virus became undetectable and pathology resolved within 14 days. The kinetics and levels of infection can be used in ferrets and hamsters as experimental models for understanding the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, and testing the protective effect of drugs.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elodie Monchatre-Leroy","author_inst":"Anses"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Lesellier","author_inst":"Anses"},{"author_name":"Marine Wasniewski","author_inst":"Anses Laboratoire de la rage et de la faune sauvage de Nancy"},{"author_name":"Evelyne Picard-Meyer","author_inst":"Anses"},{"author_name":"Celine Richomme","author_inst":"Anses"},{"author_name":"Franck Boue","author_inst":"Anses"},{"author_name":"Sandra Lacote","author_inst":"Anses"},{"author_name":"Severine Murri","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Coralie Pulido","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Johann Vulin","author_inst":"ANSES"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Salguero","author_inst":"PHE"},{"author_name":"Meriadeg Ar Legouilh","author_inst":"Normandie Universite Chu de Caen"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Servat","author_inst":"Anses"},{"author_name":"Philippe Marianneau","author_inst":"Anses"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"confirmatory results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.24.285940","rel_title":"Resveratrol And Pterostilbene Potently Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Infection In Vitro","rel_date":"2020-09-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.24.285940","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has an enormous impact on human health and economy1.

Here, we provide evidence that both resveratrol and its metabolically more stable structural analog, pterostilbene, exhibits potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Resveratrol and pterostilbene showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells and in human primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface system. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that both compounds actively interfere with the post-entry steps of virus replication cycle and their antiviral activity is long-lasting. Collectively, our data indicate that resveratrol and pterostilbene are promising antiviral compounds to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and advocate evaluation of these compounds in clinical trials","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B.

Global sequencing of thousands of genomes has revealed many common genetic variants, which are the key to unraveling the early evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 and tracking its global spread over time. However, our knowledge of fundamental events in the genome evolution and spread of this coronavirus remains grossly incomplete and highly uncertain. A deep understanding of the contemporary evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed not only for a retrospective on how, when, and why COVID-19 has emerged and spread, but also for creating remedies through efforts of science, technology, medicine, and public policy. Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history, phylogeny, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of tens of thousands of high-quality genomes. The reconstructed mutational progression is highly concordant with the timing of coronavirus sampling dates. It predicts the genome sequence of the progenitor virus whose earliest offspring, without any non-synonymous mutations, were still spreading worldwide months after the report of COVID-19. Over time, mutations of the progenitor gave rise to seven dominant lineages that spread episodically over time, some of which likely arose in Europe and North America after the genesis of the ancestral lineages in China. Mutational barcoding establishes that North American coronaviruses harbor genome signatures different from coronaviruses prevalent in Europe and Asia, which have converged over time. These spatiotemporal patterns continue to evolve as the pandemic progresses and can be viewed live online.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sudhir Kumar","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Qiqing Tao","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Steven Weaver","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Maxwell D Sanderford","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Marcos Caraballo","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Sudip Sharma","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Sergei L Kosakovsky Pond","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Sayaka Miura","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"M. van den Berge","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Diseases, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, GRIAC Research Institute, Groningen, The Netherlands."},{"author_name":"M.

Here, we conducted parallel genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E) and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we discovered phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle as well as the potential development of host-directed therapies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruofan Wang","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA"},{"author_name":"Camille R.

In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM) harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/312355v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16be58forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac31ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fdd5c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc55b0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Gregorio Marchan","author_inst":"Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Camille R.

In addition to a role in cancer, NRP-1 is a reported entry point for several viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The furin cleavage product of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein takes advantage of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) binding site on NRP-1 which accommodates a polybasic stretch ending in a C-terminal arginine. This site has long been a focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer therapeutics. We recently showed that interruption of the VEGF-A\/NRP-1 signaling pathway ameliorates neuropathic pain and hypothesize that interference of this pathway by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interferes with pain signaling. Here, we report hits from a small molecule and natural product screen of nearly 0.5 million compounds targeting the VEGF-A binding site on NRP-1. We identified nine chemical series with lead- or drug-like physico-chemical properties. Using an ELISA, we demonstrate that six compounds disrupt VEGF-A-NRP-1 binding more effectively than EG00229, a known NRP-1 inhibitor. Secondary validation in cells revealed that almost all tested compounds inhibited VEGF-A triggered VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Two compounds displayed robust inhibition of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus protein that utilizes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike for entry and fusion. These compounds represent a first step in a renewed effort to develop small molecule inhibitors of the VEGF-A\/NRP-1 signaling for the treatment of neuropathic pain and cancer with the added potential of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus entry.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha Perez-Miller","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Marcel Patek","author_inst":"Brightrockpath LLC"},{"author_name":"Aubin Moutal","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Carly R Cabel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Curtis A.

Such consequences are well established in the influenza and flavivirus fields. A first step to establish whether pre-existing responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. We compared serum antibody and memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike (S) proteins from pre-pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using a series of binding and functional assays. We found weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we found stronger evidence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells that were activated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the donors showed varying degrees of cross-reactivity with betacoronaviruses, including SARS and endemic coronaviruses. None of the cross-reactive mAbs were neutralizing except for one that targeted the S2 subunit of the S protein. The results suggest that pre-existing immunity to endemic coronaviruses should be considered in evaluating antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ge Song","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Wan-ting He","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Sean Callaghan","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Fabio Anzanello","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Deli Huang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"James Ricketts","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Jonathan L.

We hope that our reverse genetics system will contribute to the further understanding of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiho Torii","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Chikako Ono","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Rigel Suzuki","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yuhei Morioka","author_inst":"Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Itsuki Anzai","author_inst":"Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yuzy Fauzyah","author_inst":"Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Maeda","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Wataru Kamitani","author_inst":"Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Takasuke Fukuhara","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Yoshiharu Matsuura","author_inst":"Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Bryn Tennant","author_inst":"SRUC Veterinary Services"},{"author_name":"Darcy Herrity","author_inst":"Fareham Creek Veterinary Surgery"},{"author_name":"Ana C Filipe","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel G Streicker","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Brian J Willett","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Pablo R Murcia","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Ruth F Jarrett","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"David L Robertson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"William Weir","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Raiees Andrabi","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.23.309294","rel_title":"A proof of concept for neutralizing antibody-guided vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.23.309294","rel_abs":"Mutations and transient conformational movements of receptor binding domain (RBD) that make neutralizing epitopes momentarily unavailable, present immune escape routes to SARS-CoV-2.

Objective: to present the preliminary psychometric properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) and its association with important outcomes, i.e., moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: The BBES has 4 Likert-type items and was tested as part of a cross-sectional study that included 401 medical students. Reliability analysis and validity studies were performed. Results: In the parallel analysis, two factors were extracted, explaining 84.4% of the variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78, showing high internal consistency. Considering a cut-off point of 12, the odds ratio for moderate to severe depression was 3.01 (CI 1.7-5.22; p<0.001) and for last month suicidal ideation 2.96 (CI 1.6-5.48). Conclusion: The results suggest good psychometric characteristics for the BBES, thus reinforcing its utility as an assessment tool for evaluating the well-being or distress of health professionals. It carries with it the potential to implement early interventions and to prevent the descent into burnout so common today in the health care task force during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tamires Martins Bastos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Rogerio Boff Borges","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Carolina Meira Moser","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Daniel Luccas Arenas","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Ana Margareth Bassols","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Pricilla Braga Laskoski","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Zhen Cui","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Geng Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kui-Kui Lu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yin Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu-Tao Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hong-Xing Pan","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bao-Li Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.20.20198531","rel_title":"Puerto Rico Health System Resilience After Hurricane Maria: Implications for Disaster Preparedness in the COVID-19 Era","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.20.20198531","rel_abs":"Background: Every year, Puerto Rico faces a hurricane season fraught with potentially catastrophic structural, emotional and health consequences. In 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria, the largest natural disaster to ever affect the island. Several studies have estimated the excess morbidity and mortality following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, yet no study has comprehensively examined the underlying health system weaknesses contributing to the deleterious health outcomes. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted to assess the ability of the UPR health system to provide patient care in response to Hurricane Maria. An established five key resilience framework and inductive analysis was used to identify factors that affected health system resilience. Thirteen Emergency Medicine Physicians, Family Medicine Physicians, and Hospital Administrators in a University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Community Hospital were interviewed as part of our study. Results: Of the five key resiliency components, three domains were notably weak with respect to UPR resiliency. Prior to the Hurricane, key personnel at the UPR hospital were unaware of the limited capacity of back-up generators at hospitals and were ill-prepared to transfer ICU patients to appropriate hospitals. Post Hurricane, the hospital faced self-regulation challenges when triaging the provision of Hurricane-related emergency services with delivering core health services, in particular for patients with chronic conditions. Finally, during and after the Hurricane, integration of patient care coordination between the UPR hospital ambulances, neighboring hospitals, and national and state government was suboptimal. The two remaining resiliency factors, addressing diverse needs and system adaptiveness in a time of crisis, were seen as strengths. Conclusions: Hurricane Maria exposed weaknesses in the Puerto Rican health system, notably the lack of awareness about the limited capacity of backup generators, poor patient care coordination, and interruption of medical care for patients with chronic conditions. As in other countries, the current COVID epidemic is taxing the capacity of the Puerto Rico health system, which could increase the likelihood of another health system collapse should another hurricane hit the island. Therefore, a resilience framework is a useful tool to help health systems identify areas of improvement in preparation for possible natural disasters.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Rios","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Emilia Ling","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ralph Rivera Gutierrez","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico Medical Science Campus"},{"author_name":"Juan Gonzalez","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico Medical Science Campus"},{"author_name":"Janine Bruce","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Barry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vinicio de Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Zhen Cui","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Geng Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kui-Kui Lu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yin Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu-Tao Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hong-Xing Pan","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bao-Li Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.20198887","rel_title":"The effect of COVID-19 on the economy: evidence from an early adopter of localized lockdowns","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.20198887","rel_abs":"Background. Governments worldwide have implemented large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing or school closures, to prevent and control the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies, implemented with varying stringency, have imposed substantial social and economic costs to society. As some countries begin to reopen and ease mobility restrictions, lockdowns in smaller geographic areas are increasingly being considered as an attractive policy intervention to mitigate societal costs while controlling epidemic growth. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support these decisions. Methods. Drawing from a rich dataset of localized lockdowns in Chile, we used econometric methods to measure the reduction in local economic activity from lockdowns when applied to smaller or larger geographical areas. We measured economic activity by tax collection at the municipality-level. Findings. Results show lockdowns were associated with a 10-15% drop in local economic activity, a two-fold reduction compared to municipalities not under lockdown. A three-to-four-month lockdown had a similar effect on economic activity than the year of the 2009 great recession. We found that costs are proportional to the population under lockdown, without differences when lockdowns were measured at the municipality or city-wide levels. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that localized lockdowns have a large effect on local economic activity, but these effects are proportional to the population under lockdown. Our results suggest that epidemiological criteria should guide decisions about the optimal size of lockdown areas; the proportional effects of lockdowns on the economy seem to be unchanged by scale.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenzo Asahi","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eduardo A Undurraga","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Valdes","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Wagner","author_inst":"Universidad Adolfo Ibanez"},{"author_name":"Janine Bruce","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Barry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vinicio de Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Zhen Cui","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Geng Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kui-Kui Lu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yin Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu-Tao Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hong-Xing Pan","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bao-Li Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.20198911","rel_title":"Environmental impact of Personal Protective Equipment supplied to health and social care services in England in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.20198911","rel_abs":"Objectives Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been central to controlling spread of SARS-CoV2. This study aims to quantify the environmental impact of this, and to model strategies for its reduction. Methods Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE supplied to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use, air freighted, and disposed via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of 1) switching mode of, or eliminating, international travel during supply, 2) reducing glove use 3) using reusable alternatives, 4) maximal recycling. Results The carbon footprint of PPE supplied during the study period totalled 158,838 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields, and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 314 DALYs (disability adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.67 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion costing US $ 20.4 million. Scenario modelling indicated one-third of the carbon footprint could be avoided through switching to shipping, and by 41% through manufacturing PPE in the UK. The carbon footprint was reduced by 83% compared with the base scenario through a combination of UK manufacturing, reducing glove use, using reusable gowns and reuse of face shields, and maximal recycling, estimated to save 259 DALYS, 0.54 species.year, and US $ 15 million due to resource depletion. Conclusions The environmental impact of PPE could be reduced through shipping supplies or domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible, and optimising waste management.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chantelle Rizan","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Reed","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mahmood F Bhutta","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Wagner","author_inst":"Universidad Adolfo Ibanez"},{"author_name":"Janine Bruce","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Barry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vinicio de Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Zhen Cui","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Geng Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kui-Kui Lu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yin Chen","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu-Tao Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hong-Xing Pan","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bao-Li Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.22.20199471","rel_title":"Delayed viral clearance and exacerbated airway hyperinflammation in hypertensive COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.22.20199471","rel_abs":"In COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have emerged as major risk factors for critical disease progression. Concurrently, the impact of the main anti-hypertensive therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), on COVID-19 severity is controversially discussed. By combining clinical data, single-cell sequencing data of airway samples and in vitro experiments, we assessed the cellular and pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 driven by cardiovascular disease and its treatment options. Anti-hypertensive ACEi or ARB therapy, was not associated with an altered expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and thus presumably does not change susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we observed a more critical progress in COVID-19 patients with hypertension associated with a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells. While ACEi treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and intrinsic anti-viral responses, under ARB treatment enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions were observed. Macrophages and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of CCL3, CCL4, and its receptor CCR1, which associated with critical COVID-19 progression. Overall, these results provide a potential explanation for the adverse COVID-19 course in patients with cardiovascular disease, i.e. an augmented immune response in critical cells for the disease course, and might suggest a beneficial effect of clinical ACEi treatment in hypertensive COVID-patients.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saskia Trump","author_inst":"Molecular Epidemiology Unit, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin I"},{"author_name":"Soeren Lukassen","author_inst":"Center for Digital Health, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Ins"},{"author_name":"Markus S Anker","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology and Metabolism and Department of Cardiology, Charite -  Universitaetsmedizin Berlin;

Aim: To cross-validate manual and automated high-throughput (Roche-cobas6800-Target1\/Target2) testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, to describe detection rates following lockdown and relaxation, and to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-loads in different specimens. Method: The validation cohort prospectively compared Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas6800-Target1\/Target2 in 1344 naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) taken in calendar week 13 using Basel-ORF8-gene-assay for confirmation. Follow-up-cohort-1 and -2 comprised 12363 and 10207 NOPS taken over 10 weeks until calendar week 24 and 34, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-loads were compared in follow-up NOPS, lower respiratory fluids, and plasma. Results: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%) including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman r>0.95; p<0.001) for all assays. Discordant samples (N=36) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2-loads (p<0.001). Following lockdown, weekly detection rates declined to <1% reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% with similarly high SARS-CoV-2-loads, but patients were significantly younger than during lockdown (34 vs 52 years, p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in follow-up NOPS declined by 3log10 copies\/mL within 10 days post-diagnosis (p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in NOPS correlated weakly with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids and plasma, but remained detectable in 14 and 7 cases of NOPS with undetectable SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Conclusion: Evaluated manual and automated assays are highly concordant and correlate quantitatively. Following successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require dual-target-assays for clinical and epidemiologic assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be considered within <5 days, using lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karoline Leuzinger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Rainer Gosert","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Kirstine Soegaard","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Klaudia Naegele","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Julia Bielicki","author_inst":"University Children Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Serological tests monitored across the course of the second wave can provide insights into the population-level prevalence and dynamic patterns of COVID-19 infection. Objective: To assess changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees working in Tokyo during the second wave. Design: We conducted an observational cohort study. Healthy volunteers working for a Japanese company in Tokyo were enrolled from disparate locations to determine seropositivity against COVID19 from May 26 to August 25, 2020. COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined by a rapid COVID19 IgM\/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. Across the company, tests were performed and acquired weekly. For each participant, serology tests were offered twice, separated by approximately a month, to provide self-reference of test results and to assess for seroconversion and seroreversion. Setting: Workplace setting within a large company. Participants: Healthy volunteers from 1877 employees of a large Japanese company were recruited to the study from 11 disparate locations across Tokyo. Participants having fever, cough, or shortness of breath at the time of testing were excluded. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Seropositivity rate (SPR) was calculated by pooled data from each two-weeks window across the cohort. Either IgM or IgG positivity was defined as seropositive. Changes in immunological status against SARS-CoV-2 were determined by comparing results between two tests obtained from the same individual. Results: Six hundred fifteen healthy volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0; range 19-69; 45.7 % female) received at least one test. Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over the course of the summer. The most dramatic increase in SPR occurred in late June and early July, paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo, which peaked on August 4. Out of the 350 individuals (mean + SD 42.5 + 10.0; range 19-69; 46.0 % female) who completed both offered tests, 21.4 % of those individuals who tested seronegative became seropositive and seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants. 81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo despite the very low fatality rate. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases that occurred without a shut-down, herd immunity may be implicated. Sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population-level.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sawako Hibino","author_inst":"Y's Science Clinic Hiroo, Medical Corporation Koshikai"},{"author_name":"Kazutaka Hayashida","author_inst":"Boston children's hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrew C Ahn","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yasutaka Hayashida","author_inst":"Y's Science Clinic Hiroo, Medical Corporation Koshikai"},{"author_name":"Julia Bielicki","author_inst":"University Children Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate perceived levels of heat stress and its consequences in HCWs required to wear PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method: An anonymous online survey was distributed to HCWs required to wear Type 1 or 2 PPE in NHS settings to evaluate the perceived impact of PPE on: (1) physical and cognitive performance; (2) heat stress and heat-related symptoms; (3) frequency of removing PPE due to discomfort caused by heat stress; and (4) general working-life and well-being. Results: The survey received 224 responses from 192 (85.7%) women and 32 (14.3%) men. Even though 71.9% of respondents wore the less thermally challenging PPE (i.e. Type 2), a median of 3 (IQR: 2,5) heat-related symptoms were reported including syncope (7.7%). A median of 1 (IQR: 0-3) cognitive task was adversely affected with attentional focus being the most affected. To relieve discomfort, 32.6% reported removing PPE on five or more occasions in a shift. Ninety two percent reported PPE made their job more difficult and 76.2% advised that physical performance was impaired. Respondents also highlighted concerns of dermatitis and pressure sores in the facial region (22.3%) amongst other factors. Conclusion: Heat stress experienced when PPE is worn negatively impacts the performance, safety and well-being of HCWs and patients. Therefore, modification to current working practices and current design of PPE is urgently required to improve HCWs resilience to pandemics of infectious diseases. Results suggest modifications to the design of the protective face mask and strict enforcement of specific work\/rest ratios to limit the duration of PPE use would be immediate impactful interventions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Lee Davey","author_inst":"Occupational and Environmental Physiology Group, Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences,  (CSELS), Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry Universit"},{"author_name":"Ben James Lee","author_inst":"Occupational and Environmental Physiology Group, Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences,  (CSELS), Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry Universit"},{"author_name":"Timothy Robbins","author_inst":"University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Harpal Randeva","author_inst":"University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Charles Doug Thake","author_inst":"Occupational and Environmental Physiology Group, Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences,  (CSELS), Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry Universit"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

A recent in silico study found the therapeutic efficacy of Guduchi against SARS-CoV-2. Based on available evidence, we conducted a feasibility study of the safety and efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic patients with covid-19. Patients and methods: An open label, feasibility trial was conducted on 46 patients in the hospital setting. A single-arm study with no control group and blinding was executed in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. All patients orally received 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks. Clinical parameters were collected at baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. Patients were continuously monitored for side effects and adverse reactions during the study period. . Results: Out of 46 asymptomatic patients included in the study, 40 completed the 14-day follow-up period. None developed any Covid-19 symptoms after admission to the hospital. On day 3 post-treatment, viral clearance was reported in 16 (32.5%) patients. By the end of D-7, 38 (95%) patients had viral load disappearance. Follow-up at D-14 showed that all participants tested negative. Conclusion: In adult patients with asymptomatic Covid-19, Gudhuchi Ghan Vati could be effective. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes in patients with Covid-19 are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with Ayurveda.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhimanyu Kumar","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Govind Prasad","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Srivastav","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Vinod Kumar Gautam","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Neha Sharma","author_inst":"Aarogyam (UK) CIC, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

We applied novel approaches to analyze T cell reactivity and showed that T anergy is already present in non-ventilated COVID-19 patients, very pronounced in ventilated patients, strongly associated with virus persistence and reversible with clinical recovery. T cell activation was measured by downstream effects on responder cells like basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils in whole blood and proved to be much more meaningful than classical readouts with PBMCs. Monocytes responded stronger in males than females and IL-2 partially reversed T cell anergy. Downstream markers of T cell anergy were also found in fresh blood samples of critically ill patients with severe T cell anergy. Based on our data we were able to develop a score to predict fatal outcomes and to identify patients that may benefit from strategies to overcome T cell anergy.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kerstin Renner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Mueller","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Tiefenboeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Jan-Niklas Salewski","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frederike Winter","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Simone Buchtler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Maximilian V Malfertheiner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across socio-demographic groups is a crucial public policy challenge given that (1) vaccine supply will be highly constrained for the first several months of the vaccination campaign (2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from SARS-CoV-2 across groups, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 differs markedly from previous pandemic diseases like influenza. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited vaccine supply in the U.S. across groups differentiated by age and also essential worker status, which constrains opportunities for social distancing. We model transmission dynamics using a compartmental model parameterized to capture current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate trade-offs between three alternative policy objectives: minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths. Moreover, we model a dynamic strategy that responds to changes in the population epidemiological status. Because contacts are concentrated within age groups, there is diminishing marginal returns as vaccination coverage increases in a given group, increasing the group's protective immunity against infection and mortality. We find that optimal prioritization typically targets older essential workers first. However, depending on the policy objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to control spread or seniors to control mortality. When the objective is minimizing deaths, relative to a non-targeted approach, vaccine prioritization averts 15,000 deaths in our baseline model, with a range of 7,000-37,000 across alternative scenarios.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack Hoyt Buckner","author_inst":"Graduate Group in Ecology, University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael R Springborn","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jan-Niklas Salewski","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frederike Winter","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Simone Buchtler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Maximilian V Malfertheiner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

This was an observational study with a cross-sectional and time series design based on data from the information system of the State Department of Health of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The microdata from the epidemiological bulletin is open and in the public domain; consultation was carried out from March to July 2020. The incidences were stratified per 100,000 inhabitants. The cross-section study was conducted to describe COVID-19 cases, and the trend analysis was performed using polynomial regression models for time series, with R-Studio software and a significance level of 5%. There was a predominance of women among the cases, and of men in terms of deaths. The presence of comorbidities was statistically related to mortality, particularly lung disease and diabetes, and the mean age of the deaths was 67.7 years. Even though the macro-region of the state capital, Campo Grande, had a higher number of cases, the most fatalities were in the macro-region of Corumba. The trend curve demonstrated discreet growth in the incidence of cases between epidemiological weeks 11 and 19, with a significant increase in week 20 throughout the state. The trend for COVID-19 in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul was upward and regular, but there was an important and alarming exponential increase. The health authorities should adopt the necessary measures to enforce health precautions and encourage social distancing of the population so that health services will be able to care for those afflicted by the disease, especially older people, those with comorbidities, and vulnerable sectors of the population.

This study's objective was to analyze the factors associated with MSM's low psychological well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted online in the entire Brazilian territory (26 states and federal district) in April and May 2020. The participants were recruited using an adapted version of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS). Data were collected using social media and MSM dating apps. We estimated the prevalence, crude prevalence ratio (PR), and respective confidence intervals (CI95%). Results: Only 44.4% of the sample presented high levels of well-being. Low psychological well-being appeared associated with the youngest age group (PR: 2.76; CI95%: 1.90-4.01), polyamorous relationships (PR: 2.78; CI95%: 1.51-5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR: 6.27; CI95%: 4.42-8.87), not using the social media to find partners (PR: 1.63; CI95%: 1.06-2.53), having multiple sexual partners (PR: 1.80; CI95%: 1.04-3.11), having reduced the number of partners (PR: 2.67; CI95%: 1.44-4.95), and group sex (PR: 1.82; CI95%: 1.23-2.69) Conclusion: The well-being of MSM living in Brazil was negatively affected during the social distancing measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19. Policy Implications: Planning and implementing public policies and actions to promote psychological well-being are needed to improve MSM's resilience through the adoption of safe strategies and behavior.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emerson Lucas Silva Camargo","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribei\u00e3ro Preto"},{"author_name":"Bruna Isabela Adolpho de Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"},{"author_name":"Igor  Fessina Siffoni","author_inst":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Anderson Reis de Sousa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal da Bahia"},{"author_name":"Jules Ramon Brito Teixeira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal da Bahia"},{"author_name":"Isabel Amelia Costa Mendes","author_inst":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Francisco Lopes de Sousa","author_inst":"Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Its emergence has warranted the need to reorganize maternity services for childbirth. However, it is not known if this comes at an additional cost to women. We conducted a hospital-based cost analysis to estimate the out-of-pocket cost of spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) and caesarean delivery (CD). Specifically, we collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 who were managed between 1st April and 30th August 2020 at the largest teaching hospital in Lagos, the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria. We compared the mean facility-based costs for the cohort with costs paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying major cost drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. Findings showed that total utilization cost ranged from US$494 (N190,150) for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US$4,553 (N1,751,165) for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32-66% of facility-based cost has been subsidized, cost of SVD and CD have doubled and tripled respectively during the pandemic compared to those paid pre-COVID. Out of the facility-based costs paid, cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) was the major cost driver (50%) for SVD and CD. Supplemental oxygen was a major cost driver when women had severe COVID-19 symptoms and required long admission (48%). Excluding treatment costs specifically for COVID-19, mean facility-based costs for SVD and CD are US$228 (N87,750) and US$948 (N364,551) respectively. Our study demonstrates that despite cost exemptions and donations, utilization costs remain prohibitive. Regulation of the PPE and medical oxygen supply chain can help drive down utilization cost and reduce mark-ups being passed to users. The pandemic offers an opportunity to expand advocacy for subscription to health insurance schemes in order to avoid any catastrophic health expenditure.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Christian Chigozie Makwe","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mobolanle Balogun","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bosede Bukola Afolabi","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Theresa Amaogechukwu Alex-Nwangwu","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Charles Anawo Ameh","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Francisco Lopes de Sousa","author_inst":"Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Design: Rapid review with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Methods: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and Google Scholar up to 26th August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. Results: We identified 1,908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.93, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.59-2.34) compared to people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalised cohorts (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.05-2.24) and studies of PLWH across all settings (HR 2.08, 95%CI: 1.69-2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower-quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF)-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by comorbidities. Conclusion: Evidence is emerging that suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst PLWH. Further investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and CD4+ T cell count, HIV viral load, ART and the use of TDF is warranted.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maya Mellor","author_inst":"Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Anne Bast","author_inst":"Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Jones","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia Roberts","author_inst":"Outreach Librarian Knowledge Centre, Bodleian Health Care Libraries, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Jose Ordonez-Mena","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Found"},{"author_name":"Alastair Reith","author_inst":"Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher C Butler","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Founda"},{"author_name":"Jienchi Dorward","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University "},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.
