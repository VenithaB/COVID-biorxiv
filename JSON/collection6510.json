Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and informs public health interventions. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort. Results: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DR{beta}1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Human Herpes virus 7, (HHV7) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci associated with viral antibody response (P<5.0x10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, as well as CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for human herpesvirus 7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P=5.0x10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P=1.1x10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P=1.1x10-8 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen). We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, such as C4A expression in varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia. Conclusions: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linda Kachuri","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Stephen S Francis","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Maike Morrison","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"George Wendt","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yohan Boss\u00e9","author_inst":"Laval University"},{"author_name":"Taylor B Cavazos","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sara R Rashkin","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elad Ziv","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John S Witte","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.081497","rel_title":"A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model for the evaluation of COVID-19 medical countermeasures","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.081497","rel_abs":"Coronaviruses are prone to emergence into new host species most recently evidenced by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2. We used reverse genetics to remodel the S and mACE2 binding interface resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB\/c mice. Importantly, disease was more severe in aged mice, and showed more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in hACE2 transgenic mice. We then demonstrated the utility of this model through vaccine challenge studies in immune competent mice with native expression of mACE2. Lastly, we show that clinical candidate interferon (IFN) lambda-1a can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro, and both prophylactic and therapeutic administration diminished replication in mice. Our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of IFN lambda-1a treatment in human COVID-19 infections.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth H.

These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD\/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX\/P). The GD\/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD\/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX\/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD\/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD\/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD\/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD\/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD\/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth H.

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]20 {micro}M, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clarisse Salgado-Benvindo","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Thaler","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ali Tas","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Natacha S.

With initial death rates around 4%, COVID-19 patients at longer distances from Wuhan showed reduced mortality as was previously observed for the SARS coronavirus. However, the new coronavirus spreads more strongly, as it sheds long before onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms. Rapid development of a protective vaccine against COVID-19 is therefore of paramount importance. Here we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein homologous to SARS binds to ACE2, the viral receptor. Higly repetitive display of RBD on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus resulted in a vaccine candidate (RBD-CuMVTT) that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ACE2 and potently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisha Zha","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"},{"author_name":"Hongxin Zhao","author_inst":"High Magnetic Field Laboratory, CAS, 350 Shushan Hu Road, Hefei, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Mona O Mohsen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Liang Hong","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"},{"author_name":"Yuhang Zhou","author_inst":"Shandong H&Z lifescience Gmbh, Yantai, China"},{"author_name":"Zehua Li","author_inst":"International Immunology centre, Anhui agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Chuankai Yao","author_inst":"Shandong H&Z lifescience Gmbh, Yantai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongquan Chen","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"},{"author_name":"Xuelan Liu","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China; Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, "},{"author_name":"Xinyue Chang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing key laboratory of monoclonal antibody research and development, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Beijing key laboratory of monoclonal antibody research and development, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Ke Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Risk Analysis, Prediction and Management, Academy of Interdisciplinary and Advanced Studies, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhe"},{"author_name":"Monique Vogel","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Martin F Bachmann","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China; Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, "},{"author_name":"Junfeng Wang","author_inst":"High Magnetic Field Laboratory, CAS, 350 Shushan Hu Road, Hefei, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Lisa E.

We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We find that CpG relative abundance, which we characterize by an adequate force parameter taking into account statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels is, on the overall, low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses. However, the CpG force widely fluctuates along the genome, with particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the Spike protein (S) coding region and high value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside (N) coding regions, whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven, in the N protein coding region, both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG content, leading to a loss in CpG. Sequence motifs preceding these CpG-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc finger Anti-viral Protein.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Di Gioacchino","author_inst":"Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL and CNRS"},{"author_name":"Petr Sulc","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Anastassia V Komarova","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Greenbaum","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Remi Monasson","author_inst":"Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL and CNRS"},{"author_name":"Simona Cocco","author_inst":"Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL and CNRS"},{"author_name":"Chuankai Yao","author_inst":"Shandong H&Z lifescience Gmbh, Yantai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongquan Chen","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China"},{"author_name":"Xuelan Liu","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China; Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, "},{"author_name":"Xinyue Chang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing key laboratory of monoclonal antibody research and development, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Beijing key laboratory of monoclonal antibody research and development, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Ke Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Risk Analysis, Prediction and Management, Academy of Interdisciplinary and Advanced Studies, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhe"},{"author_name":"Monique Vogel","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Bern"},{"author_name":"Martin F Bachmann","author_inst":"International Immunology Centre, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China; Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Bern, "},{"author_name":"Junfeng Wang","author_inst":"High Magnetic Field Laboratory, CAS, 350 Shushan Hu Road, Hefei, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Lisa E.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.\n\nMethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nThe 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.\n\nResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.\n\nConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Messina","author_inst":"National Instritute for Infectious Diseases \"L.

In order to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suite of ribosome profiling techniques 3-8, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORF)s and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral translated ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts.

Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic.

Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. We observe similar gene expression changes from a COVID-19 patient ex vivo. In addition, we developed a new computational method termed CONditional DENSity Embedding (CONDENSE) to characterize and compare temporal gene dynamics in response to infection, which revealed genes relating to endothelin, angiogenesis, interferon, and inflammation-causing signaling pathways. In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HBECs and a COVID-19 patient and revealed genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with infection.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neal G Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mia Madel Alfajaro","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Victor Gasque","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Wei","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renata B Filler","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C Huston","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Han Wan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bao Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruth R Montgomery","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephanie C Eisenbarth","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam Williams","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamas L Horvath","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090761","rel_title":"Scaling COVID-19 against inequalities: should the policy response consistently match the mortality challenge?","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090761","rel_abs":"Background The mortality impact of COVID-19 has thus far been described in terms of crude death counts. We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially-determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. Methods We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. Results Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths, and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. Conclusion Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to build back better.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerry McCartney","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Alastair Leyland","author_inst":"MRC\/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"David Walsh","author_inst":"Glasgow Centre for Population Health"},{"author_name":"Ruth Dundas","author_inst":"MRC\/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Renata B Filler","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C Huston","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Han Wan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Klara Szigeti-Buck","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bao Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruth R Montgomery","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephanie C Eisenbarth","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam Williams","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamas L Horvath","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090878","rel_title":"The disproportionate rise in COVID-19 cases among Hispanic\/Latinx in disadvantaged communities of Orange County, California: A socioeconomic case-series","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090878","rel_abs":"Background: Recent epidemiological evidence has demonstrated a higher rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among minorities. This pattern of race-ethnic disparities emerging throughout the United States raises the question of what social factors may influence spread of a highly transmissible novel coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to describe race-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities associated with COVID-19 in patients in our community in Orange County, California and understand the role of individual-level factors, neighborhood-level factors, and access to care on outcomes. Methods: This is a case-series of COVID-19 patients from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) across six-weeks between 3\/12\/2020 and 4\/22\/2020. Note, California's shelter-in-place order began on 3\/19\/2020. Individual-level factors included race-ethnicity status were recorded. Neighborhood-level factors from census tracts included median household income, mean household size, proportion without a college degree, proportion working from home, and proportion without health insurance were also recorded. Results: A total of 210-patients tested were COVID-19 positive, of which 73.3% (154\/210) resided in Orange County. Hispanic\/Latinx patients residing in census tracts below the median income demonstrated exponential growth (rate = 55.9%, R2 = 0.9742) during the study period. In addition, there was a significant difference for both race-ethnic (p < 0.001) and income bracket (p = 0.001) distributions prior to and after California's shelter-in-place. In addition, the percentage of individuals residing in neighborhoods with denser households (p = 0.046), lower levels of college graduation (p < 0.001), health insurance coverage (p = 0.01), and ability to work from home (p < 0.001) significantly increased over the same timeframe. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study examines the race-ethnic disparities in Orange County, CA, and highlights vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19. Our descriptive case series illustrates that we also need to consider socioeconomic factors, which ultimately set the stage for biological and social disparities.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel S Chow","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Soun","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Justin Gavis-Bloom","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Brent Weinberg","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter Chang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Simukayi Mutasa","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Edwin Monuki","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jung In Park","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Xie","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bota","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jie Wu","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090746","rel_title":"Urban Air Pollution May Enhance COVID-19 Case-Fatality and Mortality Rates in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090746","rel_abs":"Background: The novel human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 240,000 lives worldwide, causing tremendous public health, social, and economic damages. While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, sociodemographic, socioeconomic status, behavior risk factors, and meteorological factors. Results: 1,027,799 COVID-19 cases and 58,489 deaths were reported in 3,122 US counties from January 22, 2020 to April 29, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 5.8%. Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values<0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM2.5 or O3 and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values>0.05), although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.4 ug\/m3) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate. Discussions and Conclusions: Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Donghai Liang","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Liuhua Shi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Zhao","author_inst":"American Cancer Society"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Liu","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Joel Schwartz","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Song Gao","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Sarnat","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stefanie T Ebelt","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Noah C Scovronick","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Howard Chang","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090670","rel_title":"Projection of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US as Individual States Re-open May 4,2020","rel_date":"2020-05-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090670","rel_abs":"In March and April 2020, control measures enforcing social distancing and restricting individual movement and contact were adopted across the United States in an effort to slow the spread and growth of COVID-19.

We found that cooperativity was important to capture country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective containment of COVID-19. Finally, in the USA we find that by the summer of 2021, a difference of about 1.5 million deaths may be observed depending on whether the interventions are to be maintained strictly or lifted in entirety.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziwei Dai","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Jason W Locasale","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sasikiran Kandula","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joel Schwartz","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Song Gao","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeremy A Sarnat","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stefanie T Ebelt","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Noah C Scovronick","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Howard Chang","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088781","rel_title":"Updated estimates of comorbidities associated with risk for COVID-19 complications based on US data","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088781","rel_abs":"We updated previous estimates (wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/26\/8\/20-0679_article) of adults with any underlying condition increasing risk of complications from COVID-19 using recent US hospitalization data instead of mortality data from China.

The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in children remains low to date. In just a few months, COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide, and as of the date of this publication, the pandemic continues. Based on the current available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than adults. However, children with neurological and neuromuscular conditions are vulnerable to the respiratory complications of other viral infections. Objectives. To assess whether children with brain-based developmental disabilities were more likely to develop COVID-19 and have complications or poorer outcomes following infection. Methods. We conducted a two-week rapid review on studies with primary data regarding children aged between zero and 18 years old with brain-based developmental disabilities, or who were at risk of developing such disabilities, with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. We performed our literature searches on April 18, 2020. Results. Our search strategy identified 538 individual records, of which four were included in our review. Of the 50 COVID-19 pediatric patients reported in the included studies, a total of seven children were at risk of developing brain-based disabilities. Symptoms ranged in severity. However, generally, patients were discharged or saw improvements in their symptoms by the end of the study period. No deaths were reported. Discussion. Our study highlights a knowledge gap regarding the impact of COVID-19 in children with brain-based developmental disabilities.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michele Dugas","author_inst":"VITAM Centre de recherche en sante durable, CIUSSS de la Capitale Nationale, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Valerie Carnovale","author_inst":"VITAM Centre de recherche en sante durable, CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Andree-Anne Poirier","author_inst":"VITAM Centre de recherche en sante durable, CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada; Institut national d'excellence en sante et servic"},{"author_name":"Benoit Mailot","author_inst":"VITAM Centre de recherche en sante durable, CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Becky Skidmore","author_inst":"Independent Information Specialist, Ottawa, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lena Faust","author_inst":"Patient-partner (youth) with the CHILD-BRIGHT Network; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Carrie Costello","author_inst":"Patient-partner (caregiver) with the CHILD-BRIGHT Network"},{"author_name":"Donna Thomson","author_inst":"Patient-partner (caregiver) with the CHILD-BRIGHT Network"},{"author_name":"Annette Majnemer","author_inst":"School of Physical & Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dan Goldowitz","author_inst":"Department of Medical Genetics, Centre of Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"},{"author_name":"Steven Miller","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Annie LeBlanc","author_inst":"VITAM Centre de recherche en sante durable, CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ellen F Foxman","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard W Pierce","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088997","rel_title":"Predictive Model with Analysis of the Initial Spread of COVID-19 in India","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088997","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has currently ravaged through the world, resulting in over three million confirmed cases and over two hundred thousand deaths, a complete change in daily life as we know it, worldwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, as well as heightened hygiene measures and physical distancing.

Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing the efficacy of serostatus on future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Kahn","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing performance across countries or territories (such as states in the USA), and could inform policy decisions about COVID-19 mitigation strategies. But comparing cases and fatality across territories is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across countries or US states. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity-of-COVID-19-case-incidence. We found a 10% increase in testing yielded ~9% (95% CI:4.2-13.4%; p<0.001) increase in reported cases across countries, and ~2% (95%CI:0.1-3.4%; p=0.03) increase across US states during the week ending April 10th, 2020. We found comparable negative elasticities for fatality rates (across countries: beta;=-0.77, 95%CI:-1.40- -0.14; p=0.02; US states: beta;=-0.15, 95%CI:-0.30-0.01; p=0.06). Our results were robust to various model specifications. Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio (PTR) growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth. We hope these results can help support evidence-based decisions by public health officials as more consistent data hopefully becomes available.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenzo Asahi","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eduardo A.

Minimizing human and socioeconomic costs of SARS-CoV-2 and future global pandemics requires data-driven and context-specific integrative modeling of detection-tracing, healthcare, and non-pharmaceutical interventions for decision-processes and reopening strategies. Traditional population-based epidemiological models cannot simulate temporal infection dynamics for individual human behavior in specific geolocations. We present an integrated geolocalized and demographically referenced spatio-temporal stochastic network- and agent-based model of COVID-19 dynamics for human encounters in real-world communities. Simulating intervention scenarios, we quantify effects of protection and identify the importance of early introduction of test-trace measures. Critically, we observe bimodality in SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics so that the outcome of reopening can flip between good and poor outcomes stochastically. Furthermore, intervention effectiveness depends on strict execution and temporal control i.e. leaks can prevent successful outcomes. Schools are in many scenarios hubs for transmission, reopening scenarios are impacted by infection chain stochasticity and subsequent outbreaks do not always occur. This generalizable geospatial and individualized methodology is unique in precision and specificity compared to prior COVID-19 models [6, 16, 17, 19] and is applicable to scientifically guided decision processes for communities world-wide.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bjoern Goldenbogen","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Stephan O.

We examined the associations of stay-at-home order (SAHO) and face-masking recommendation with epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the United States. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, we modeled the temporal trends in daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) in the United States between March 1 and April 20, 2020, and conducted simulation studies. Results: The number and proportion of U.S. residents under SAHO increased between March 19 and April 7, and plateaued at 29,0829,980 and 88.6%, respectively. Trends in COVID-19 daily cases and Rt reduced after March 23 (P<0.001) and further reduced on April 3 (P<0.001), which was associated with implementation of SAHO by 10 states on March 23, and face-masking recommendation on April 3, respectively. The estimates of Rt eventually fell below\/around 1.0 on April 13. Similar turning points were identified in the trends of daily deaths with a lag time. Early implementation and early-removal of SAHO would be associated with significantly reduced and increased daily new cases and deaths, respectively.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Ninth Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Sabiha Hussain","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Guanzhu Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Ninth Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kai Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA"},{"author_name":"Shi Wei","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL"},{"author_name":"Wei Bao","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Lanjing Zhang","author_inst":"Princeton Medical Center\/Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Johanna E L Haffner","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maria Krantz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maxim Karnetzki","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Ivo Maintz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mallis","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rafael U Moran Torres","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hannah Prawitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Patrick Segelitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Seeger","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rune Linding","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Edda Klipp","author_inst":"Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088591","rel_title":"Predictive mathematical models for the number of individuals infected with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088591","rel_abs":"We model the time-evolution of the number N(t) of individuals reported to be infected in a given country with a specific virus, in terms of a Riccati equation. Although this equation is nonlinear and it contains time-dependent coefficients, it can be solved in closed form, yielding an expression for N(t) that depends on a function (t). For the particular case that (t) is constant, this expression reduces to the well-known logistic formula, giving rise to a sigmoidal curve suitable for modelling usual epidemics. However, for the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the long series of available data shows that the use of this simple formula for predictions underestimates N(t); thus, the logistic formula only provides a lower bound of N(t). After experimenting with more than 50 different forms of (t), we introduce two novel models that will be referred to as 'rational' and 'birational'. The parameters specifying these models (as well as those of the logistic model), are determined from the available data using an error-minimizing algorithm. The analysis of the applicability of the above models to the cases of China and South Korea suggest that they yield more accurate predictions, and importantly that they may provide an upper bound of the actual N(t). Results are presented for Italy, Spain, and France.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Athanasios S Fokas","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Dikaios","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"George A Kastis","author_inst":"Academy of Athens"},{"author_name":"Kai Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA"},{"author_name":"Shi Wei","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL"},{"author_name":"Wei Bao","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Lanjing Zhang","author_inst":"Princeton Medical Center\/Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Johanna E L Haffner","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maria Krantz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maxim Karnetzki","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Ivo Maintz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mallis","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rafael U Moran Torres","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hannah Prawitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Patrick Segelitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Seeger","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rune Linding","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Edda Klipp","author_inst":"Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087809","rel_title":"Time-adjusted Analysis Shows Weak Associations Between BCG Vaccination Policy and COVID-19 Disease Progression","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087809","rel_abs":"In this study, we ascertain the associations between BCG vaccination policies and progression of COVID-19 through analysis of various time-adjusted indicators either directly extracted from the incidence and death reports, or estimated as parameters of disease progression models.

With most diagnostic infrastructure dependent on specialised instruments, their exclusive reagent supplies quickly become bottlenecks in times of peak demand, creating an urgent need for novel approaches to boost testing capacity. We address this challenge by refocusing the full synthetic biology stack available at the London Biofoundry onto the development of alternative patient sample testing pipelines. We present a reagent-agnostic automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that can be quickly deployed and scaled, and that accepts a diverse range of reagents. Using an in-house-generated, open-source, MS2-virus-like-particle-SARS-CoV-2 standard, we validate RNA extraction and RT-qPCR workflows as well as two novel detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas and Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) approaches. In collaboration with an NHS diagnostic testing lab, we report the performance of the overall workflow and benchmark SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples via RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas, and LAMP against clinical test sets. The validated RNA extraction and RT-qPCR platform has been installed in NHS diagnostic labs with a testing capacity of 1000 samples per day and now contributes to increased patient sample processing in the UK while we continue to refine and develop novel high-throughput diagnostic methods. Finally, our workflows and protocols can be quickly implemented and adapted by members of the Global Biofoundry Alliance and the wider scientific and medical diagnostics community.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael A Crone","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Miles Priestman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marta Ciechonska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Jensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"David J Sharp","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Marko Storch","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Freemont","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Krantz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Maxim Karnetzki","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Ivo Maintz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mallis","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rafael U Moran Torres","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Hannah Prawitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Patrick Segelitz","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Martin Seeger","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Rune Linding","author_inst":"Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Edda Klipp","author_inst":"Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Craig Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
