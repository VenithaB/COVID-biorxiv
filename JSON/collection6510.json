In each subpopulation, representing a locality, disease propagates according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) dynamics. We assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. We also assume that susceptible and exposed (pre-symptomatic and infectious) individuals can travel between localities. To investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities, we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre-symptomatic individuals. We establish a lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin as a function of the speed of spread. We associate the behavior change at the disease-importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality. Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for low mobility regimes. We show the accuracy of the bounds in determining critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from becoming endemic at neighboring localities. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates. Our results highlight the importance of preparedness at localities where cases are beginning to rise, and demonstrate the benefits of increase in contact reduction by considering the outbreaks in neighboring localities with severe, rather than weak, outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ceyhun Eksin","author_inst":"Texas A&M"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"Texas A&M"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078493","rel_title":"Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078493","rel_abs":"Abstract In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived. When R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conghui Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yongguang Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"YangQuan Chen","author_inst":"University of California Merced"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhen Lu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078485","rel_title":"On the reliability of model-based predictions in the context of the current COVID epidemic event: impact of outbreak peak phase and data paucity","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078485","rel_abs":"The pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus has, as of 20th of April 2020, reached most countries of the world. In an effort to design informed public health policies, many modelling studies have been performed to predict crucial outcomes of interest, including ICU solicitation, cumulated death counts, etc... The corresponding data analyses however, mostly rely on restricted (openly available) data sources, which typically include daily death rates and confirmed COVID cases time series. In addition, many of these predictions are derived before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet (as is still currently the case for many countries). In this work, we show that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions. Although we focus on a recent model of the COVID pandemics, our conclusions most likely apply to most existing models, which are variants of the so-called 'Susceptible-Infected-Removed' or SIR framework. Our results highlight the need for performing systematic reliability evaluations for all models that currently inform public health policies.

The EDI has not been independently evaluated, and other proprietary models have been shown to be biased against vulnerable populations. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to non-ICU care at a large academic medical center from March 9 through May 20, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite outcome of ICU-level care, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. Results: Among 392 COVID-19 hospitalizations meeting inclusion criteria, 103 (26%) met the composite outcome. Median age of the cohort was 64 (IQR 53-75) with 168 (43%) African Americans and 169 (43%) women. Area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of the EDI was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84). EDI predictions did not differ by race or sex. When exploring clinically-relevant thresholds of the EDI, we found patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 68.8 made up 14% of the study cohort and had a 74% probability of experiencing the composite outcome during their hospitalization with a median lead time of 24 hours from when this threshold was first exceeded. Among the 286 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) never exceeded an EDI of 37.9, with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity above this threshold of 91%. Conclusion: We found the EDI identifies small subsets of high- and low-risk COVID-19 patients with fair discrimination. We did not find evidence of bias by race or sex. These findings highlight the importance of independent evaluation of proprietary models before widespread operational use among COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karandeep Singh","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thomas S.

The chest computed tomography (CT) could be serve as an effective tool in detection of COVID-19. Its valuable to develop automatic detection of COVID-19. Material and Methods: The collected dataset consisted of 521 COVID-19 chest CT images, 397 normal chest CT images, 76 bacterial pneumonia chest CT images and 48 SARS chest CT images obtained by exhaustively searching available data on the Internet. Then, these data are divided into three sets, referred to training set, validation set and testing set. Sixteen data augmentation operations are designed to enrich the training set in deep learning training phase. Multiple experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the model in the detection of COVID-19 both in case of no noisy labels and noisy labels. The performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Results: The data augmentation operations on the training set is effective for improvement of the model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9689 with (95% CI: 0.9308, 1) in case of no noisy labels, while the per-exam sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting COVID-19 in the independent testing set are 90.52%, 91.58% and 91.21%, respectively. Besides, the model is robust when part of the training samples is marked incorrectly. The AUC is 92.23% in the case of noisy labels of 10% in the training set. Conclusion A deep learning model with insufficient samples can be developed by using data augmentation in assisting medical workers in making quick and correct diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Runwen Hu","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Guanqi Ruan","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Shijun Xiang","author_inst":"The School of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Minghui Huang","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Qiaoyi Liang","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Li","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Wiens","author_inst":"University of Michigan College of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Erkin Otles","author_inst":"University of Michigan College of Engineering"},{"author_name":"John P.

Considering that a vaccine for COVID-19 is will not be available soon, it is important to identify populations with high risk from COVID-19 and take measures to prevent outbreaks and build healthcare infrastructure at the local level. Methods We used data from two large nationally representative household surveys, administrative sources, and published studies to estimate the risk of COVID-19 at the district level in India. We employed principal component analysis to create an index of the health risk of COVID-19 from demographic and comorbidity indicators such as the proportions of elderly population and rates of diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory illnesses. Another principal component index examined the socioeconomic and healthcare access risk from COVID-19, based on the standard of living, proportion of caste groups, and per capita access to public healthcare in each district. Results Districts in northern, southern and western Indian states such as Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra were at the highest health risk from COVID-19. Many of these districts have been designated as COVID-19 hotspots by the Indian government because of emergent outbreaks. Districts in eastern and central states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh have higher socioeconomic and healthcare access risk as compared with other areas. Interpretation Districts at high risk of COVID-19 should prioritize policy measures for preventing outbreaks, and improving critical care infrastructure and socioeconomic safety nets.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arindam Nandi","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ruchita Balasubramanian","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ramanan Laxminarayan","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Michele Higa Froes","author_inst":"Public Hospital of the Government Employees of Sao Paulo (HSPM)"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kanda Abe","author_inst":"Public Hospital of the Government Employees of Sao Paulo (HSPM)"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Li","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Wiens","author_inst":"University of Michigan College of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Erkin Otles","author_inst":"University of Michigan College of Engineering"},{"author_name":"John P.

For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of quarantine in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed quarantine duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the quarantine can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration quarantine is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the quarantine is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing quarantine duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different quarantine durations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Konstantin B Blyuss","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Yuliya N Kyrychko","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Pamela Mancini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Giusy Bonanno Ferraro","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Carolina Veneri","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bonadonna","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"John P.

DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until April 23, 2020 (one day before submission). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomised trials evaluating the effect of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomised trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. RESULTS: We screened 1,043 records but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomised trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision makers in the near future.

However, it remains unclear if the disparity in mortality is due to gender differences in high-risk characteristics. Objective To study the clinical characteristics of a large and diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients stratified by gender and determine the outcomes after matching for age and other high-risk characteristics. Design Retrospective cohort between January 20, 2020, and April 15, 2020 Setting TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network consisting of multiple healthcare organizations (HCOs) predominantly in the United States Participants and Exposure A cohort of male and female patients > 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19 identified with real-time analyses of electronic medical records of patients from participating HCOs. A 1:1 propensity score matching of cohorts was performed for age, race, nicotine use, and all possible confounding comorbidities. Main Outcome Risk of mortality, hospitalization and mechanical ventilation within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 Results A total of 5980 males and 7730 females diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified. Males were significantly older than females (54.9 (18.3) vs. 50.9 (18.4), p-value <0.0001). There were significant differences in patient characteristics, but after propensity matching, both groups (N=5350 each group) were balanced. Males had a significantly higher risk for mortality both before (Risk Ratio (RR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4) and after matching (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7). Similarly, the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4) and mechanical ventilation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) was significantly higher in males even after matching. On subanalysis, males age > 50 had higher mortality than matched females of similar age (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8), whereas the risk of mortality in matched groups < 40 years was similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.4-2.4). Conclusion In conclusion, males are more severely affected and have higher mortality from COVID-19. This gender-specific risk is especially more pronounced in advanced age. Gender disparity in poor outcomes can only be partially explained by differences in high-risk behavior and comorbidities. Further research is needed to understand the causes of this disparity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shailendra Singh","author_inst":"Charleston Area Medical Center, Charleston WV"},{"author_name":"Monica Chowdhry","author_inst":"West Virginia University Health Sciences Center Charleston Division, Charleston, WV"},{"author_name":"Arka Chatterjee","author_inst":"Division of Cardiovascular Disease, University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Khan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center Charleston Division, Charleston, WV"},{"author_name":"Carolina Veneri","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bonadonna","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"John P.

However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19 disease Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Results: Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] x109 cells\/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) x109 cells\/L and -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells\/l, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg\/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg\/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng\/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg\/ml). Conclusions and Relevance: Relative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jude Moutchia","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Pratik Pokharel","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aldiona Kerri","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kaodi McGaw","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shreeshti Uchai","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miriam Nji","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Goodman","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"John P.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting select genes of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been the main diagnostic tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not been studied systematically outside of the laboratory setting. The aim of this study is to provide estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR test developed by China CDC. Methods. The study design is a secondary analysis of published findings on 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, of whom 601 tested positive and 413 were negative for COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach from probabilistic knowledge of the diagnostic errors. Predictive values of the test were calculated, resulting in estimates for the number of confirmatory tests that are needed for establishing the presence or absence of COVID-19, depending on the prior probability of a patient having the disease. Results. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was estimated to be 0.777 (95% CI: 0.715, 0.849), while the specificity was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.933, 1.000). The confidence intervals include sampling error in addition to the error due to probabilistic knowledge of the data. Discussion. The Chinese version of the RT-PCR test had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID-19. For a patient with a prior probability of COVID-19 greater than 18%, at least two negative test results would be needed to lower the chances of COVID-19 below 5%. Caution is advised in generalizing these findings to other versions of the RT-PCR test that are being used in diverse geographic regions.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil S Padhye","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Pratik Pokharel","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aldiona Kerri","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kaodi McGaw","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shreeshti Uchai","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miriam Nji","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Goodman","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"John P.

Novel methods like pooling of samples are the need of the hour. Method: Extracted RNA samples were randomly placed in pools of 8 on a 96 well plate. Both individual RNA (ID) and pooled RNA RT-qPCR for the screening E gene were done in the same plate and the positivity for the E gene was seen. Results: The present study demonstrated that pool testing with 8 RNA samples can easily detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 38. The present study also showed that the results of pool testing is not affected by number of positive samples in a pool. Conclusion: Pooling of 8 RNA samples can reduce the time and expense by one eighth, and can help expand diagnostic capabilities, especially during constrained supply of reagents and PCR kits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ekta Gupta","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Padhi","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Arvind Khodare","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reshu Aggarwal","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Krithiga Ramachandran","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vibha Mehta","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mousumi Kilikdar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Dubey","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Jonathon P.

Here, we quantify and characterize intra-host variation in SARS-CoV-2 raw sequence data uploaded to SRA as of 14 April 2020, and compare results between two sequencing methods (amplicon and RNA-Seq). Raw fastq files were quality filtered and trimmed using Trimmomatic, mapped to the WuhanHu1 reference genome using Bowtie2, and variants called with bcftools mpileup. To ensure sufficient coverage, we only included samples with 10X coverage for >90% of the genome (n=406 samples), and only variants with a depth >=10. Derived (i.e. non-reference) alleles were found at 408 sites. The number of polymorphic sites (i.e. sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295\/406) having at least one polymorphic site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R2 < 0.1, p < 0.05). Polymorphisms were observed >1 sample at 66 sites (range: 2-38 samples). The minor allele frequency (MAF) at each shared polymorphic site was 0.03% - 48.5%. 33\/66 sites occurred in ORF1a1b, and 37\/66 changes were non-synonymous. At 10\/66 sites, derived alleles were found in samples sequenced using both methods. Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at 10\/10 positions, while polymorphic RNA-Seq samples were found at 7\/10 positions. In conclusion, our results suggest that intra-host variation is prevalent among clinical samples. While mutations resulting from amplification and\/or sequencing errors cannot be excluded, the observation of shared polymorphic sites with high MAF across multiple samples and sequencing methods is consistent with true underlying variation. Further investigation into intra-host evolutionary dynamics, particularly with longitudinal sampling, is critical for broader understanding of disease progression.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Rose","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"David J Nolan","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Samual Moot","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Amy Feehan","author_inst":"Ochsner Clinic Foundation"},{"author_name":"Sissy Cross","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Julia Garcia-Diaz","author_inst":"Ochsner Clinic Foundation"},{"author_name":"Susanna L Lamers","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Dubey","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Jonathon P.

In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked cou-pling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, in-fected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during in-cubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numer-ical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stim-ulated by using the real-data from 23 January to 18 - m March, 2020 where m is equal to the number of predic-tion days. Compared with integer-order system ( = 0), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case with-out network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure.

We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: 1. amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? 2. Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? 3. What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection, or pre-symptomatic? METHODS AND FINDINGS We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020 and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up, or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% CI 17-25) with a prediction interval of 3-67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26-37%, prediction interval 24-38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is pre-symptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was slightly lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10-1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases, we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections, and that the database does not include all sources. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this living systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggest that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection. The contribution of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diana C Buitrago-Garcia","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland; Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dianne Egli-Gany","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Michel J Counotte","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Hossmann","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hira Imeri","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Aziz Mert Ipekci","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern,, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Georgia Salanti","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Jonathon P.

The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Methodology: Data were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with [&ge;]50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020. Results: Brazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates. Conclusions: The COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine Simbana-Rivera","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad de las Americas, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Lenin Gomez-Barreno","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research group, Universidad de las Americas, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Jhon Guerrero","author_inst":"Scientific Association of Medical Students, Universidad Central del Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Simbana-Guaycha","author_inst":"Scientific Association of Medical Students, Universidad Central del Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Raul Fernandez","author_inst":"One Health Global research group, Universidad de las Americas, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Andres Lopez-Cortes Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad UTE"},{"author_name":"Alex Lister","author_inst":"University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Esteban Ortiz-Prado","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad De Las Americas"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Jonathon P.

This study aimed to compare the effect of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK) governments on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic as predicted by a mathematical model. Method: Data on the numbers of cases, deaths and government measures were collected from Saudi Ministry of Health and Public Health England. A prediction of the trend of cases, deaths and days to peak was then modelled using the mathematical technique, Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model. The measures taken by the governments and the predicted outcomes were compared to assess effectiveness. Result: We found over three months that 22 fast and extreme measures had been taken in Saudi Arabia compared to eight slow and late measures in the UK. This resulted in a decline in numbers of current infected cases per day and mortality in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK. Based on the SIR model, the predicted number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi as of 31st of March was 2064, while the predicted number of cases was 63012 in the UK. In addition, the pandemic is predicted to peak earlier on the 27th of March in Saudi Arabia compared to the 2nd of May 2020 in the UK. The end of transition phases for Saudi and UK according to the model, were predicted to be on 18th of April and 24th of May, respectively. These numbers relate to early and decisive measures adopted by the Saudi government. Conclusion: We show that early extreme measures, informed by science and guided by experience, helped reduce the spread and related deaths from COVID-19 in Saudi. Actions were taken by Saudi Arabia under the national slogan (We are all responsible) resulted in the observed reduced number of current and predicted cases and deaths compared to the UK approach (keep calm and carry on).","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saleh Komies","author_inst":"Faculty of Engineering, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdulelah M Aldhahir","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mater Almehmadi","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Saeed M Alghamdi","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ali Alqarni","author_inst":"Centre of Host Microbe Interaction (CHMI), Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences, Kings College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tope Oyelade","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaber S Alqahtani","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Esteban Ortiz-Prado","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad De Las Americas"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Jonathon P.

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laurel Kroo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Anesta Kothari","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Melanie Hannebelle","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"George Herring","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Thibaut Pollina","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ray Chang MD","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Samhita P.

Along with hemodynamic changes such as prolonged clotting time, high fibrin degradation products and D-dimers, increased levels of monocytes with disturbed morphology have also been identified. In this study, through an integrated analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data from Covid-19 patients with data from single-cell sequencing studies on lung tissues, we found that most of the cell-types that contributed to the altered gene expression were of hematopoietic origin. We also found that differentially expressed genes in Covid-19 patients formed a significant pool of the expressing genes in phagocytic cells such as Monocytes and Platelets. Interestingly, while we observed a general enrichment for Monocytes in Covid-19 patients, we found that the signal for FCGRA3+ Monocytes was depleted. Further, we found evidence that age-associated gene expression changes in Monocytes and Platelets, associated with inflammation, mirror gene expression changes in Covid-19 patients suggesting that pro-inflammatory signalling during aging may worsen the infection in older patients. We identified more than 20 genes that change in the same direction between Covid-19 infection and aging cells that may act as potential therapeutic targets. Of particular interest were IL2RG, GNLY and GMZA expressed in Platelets, which facilitates cytokine signalling in Monocytes through an interaction with Platelets. To understand whether infection can directly manipulate the biology of Monocytes and Platelets, we hypothesize that these non-ACE2 expressing cells may be infected by the virus through the phagocytic route. We observed that phagocytic cells such as Monocytes, T-cells, and Platelets have a significantly higher expression of genes that are a part of the Covid-19 viral interactome. Hence these cell-types may have an active rather than a reactive role in viral pathogenesis to manifest clinical symptoms such as coagulopathy. Therefore, our results present molecular evidence for pursuing both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation therapy for better patient management especially in older patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shreya Johri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Deepali Jain","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ishaan Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"George Herring","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Thibaut Pollina","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ray Chang MD","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Samhita P.

Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poor outcome. Results. Among enrolled 114 patients, 94 (82.5%) had good outcome while 20 (17.5%) had poor outcome. No significant differences were showed in age, gender and the prevalence of coexisting disorders between outcome groups. Results of multivariate Cox analyses indicated that higher levels of oxygen saturation (HR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.041-0.369), albumin (HR, 0.060; 95% CI, 0.008-0.460) and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (HR, 0.321; 95% CI, 0.106-0.973) were associated with decreased risk of developing poor outcome within 28 days. In the other hand, higher levels of leucocytes (HR, 5.575; 95% CI, 2.080-14.943), neutrophils (HR, 2.566; 95% CI, 1.022-6.443), total bilirubin (HR, 6.171; 95% CI, 2.458-15.496), globulin (HR, 2.526; 95% CI, 1.027-6.211), blood urea nitrogen (HR, 5.640; 95% CI, 2.193-14.509), creatine kinase-MB (HR, 3.032; 95% CI, 1.203-7.644), lactate dehydrogenase (HR, 4.607; 95% CI, 1.057-20.090), hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (HR, 5.023; 95% CI, 1.921-13.136), lactate concentration (HR,15.721; 95% CI, 2.099-117.777), Interleukin-10 (HR, 3.551; 95% CI, 1.280-9.857) and C-reactive protein (HR, 5.275; 95% CI, 1.517-18.344) were associated with increased risk of poor outcome development. We also found that traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the patient's condition, which is conducive to the transformation from severe to mild. Conclusion. In summary, we firstly reported this single-centered, prospective and observational study for short-term outcome in severe patients with COVID-19. We found that cytokine storm and uncontrolled inflammation responses, liver, kidney, cardiac dysfunction may play important roles in final outcome of severe ill patients with COVID-19. Our study will provide clinicians to be benefit to rapidly estimate the likelihood risk of short-term poor outcome for severe patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaobo Feng Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peiyun Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liang Ma","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hang Liang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Lei","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenqiang Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kun Wang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Song","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuai Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Cao Yang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Emma Pan","author_inst":"Olin College"},{"author_name":"Khang Vu","author_inst":"Olin College"},{"author_name":"Kelly Yen","author_inst":"Olin College"},{"author_name":"James Dale","author_inst":"Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Patrick Kolbay","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Simon Ellgas","author_inst":"Waymo"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Konte","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Rozhin Hajian","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Grace Zhong","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noah Jacobs","author_inst":"Mountain View, CA"},{"author_name":"Amit Jain","author_inst":"Mountain View, CA"},{"author_name":"Filip Kober","author_inst":"Poznan, Poland"},{"author_name":"Gerry Ayala","author_inst":"WildHorn Outfitters, Utah"},{"author_name":"Quentin Allinne","author_inst":"Decathlon"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cucinelli","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dave Kasper","author_inst":"iSnorkel"},{"author_name":"Luca Borroni","author_inst":"Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrick Gerber","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Ross Venook","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter Baek MD","author_inst":"US.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine centre for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Results: Between March 10th and April 4th, 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8\/13 (62%) vs. 17\/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20\/27 (74%) available saliva; 7\/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13\/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P<0.001 for difference over first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts. Conclusions: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS. NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but they appear able to transmit the virus to others.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nguyen Van Vinh Chau","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Vo Thanh Lam","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Ngo Ngoc Quang Minh","author_inst":"Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nghiem My Ngoc","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Tri Dung","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Dinh Nguyen Huy Man","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Lam Anh Nguyet","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Le Thanh Hoang Nhat","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Le Nguyen Truc Nhu","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Han Ny","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Thu Hong","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Evelyne Kestelyn","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Phuong Dung","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Phong","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tran Chan Xuan","author_inst":"Cu Chi Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Ronald B.
