The sequencing was carried out by the Child Health Research Foundation and provided the first insight into the genetic details of the viral strain responsible for the SARS-CoV-2 infections in Bangladesh. Here we carried out a comparative study were we explored the phylogenetic relationship between the Bangladeshi isolate with other isolates from different parts of the world. Afterwards we identified single nucleotide variants in the Bangladeshi isolate, using the Wuhan virus reference sequence. We found a total of 9 variants in the Bangladeshi isolate using 2 separate tools. Barring 2, the rest of these variants were also observed in other isolates from different countries. Most of the variants occurred in the ORF1ab gen. Another noteworthy finding was a sequence of three consecutive variants in the N protein gene that were observed in other isolates as well. Lastly the phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between the Bangladeshi isolate and those from Taiwan, Kazakhstan, Greece, California, Spain, Israel, and Sri Lanka.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saam Hasan","author_inst":"North South University"},{"author_name":"Salim Khan","author_inst":"BCSIR, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Gias U.

Vaccines are an essential countermeasure urgently needed to control the pandemic4. Here, we show that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice, eliciting a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was not Th2 dominated, as demonstrated by IgG subclass and cytokine expression profiling. A single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced a humoral and cellular immune response in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated rhesus macaques. Importantly, no evidence of immune-enhanced disease following viral challenge in vaccinated animals was observed. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is currently under investigation in a phase I clinical trial. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomised controlled human clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Teresa Lambe","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alex Spencer","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sandra Belij-Rammerstorfer","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jyothi Purushotham","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Julia Port","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Victoria Avanzato","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Trenton Bushmaker","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Amy Flaxman","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marta Ulaszewska","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Friederike Feldmann","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Allen","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hannah Sharpe","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Schulz","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Myndi Holbrook","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.090324","rel_title":"Infection Groups Differential (IGD) Score Reveals Infection Ability Difference between SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.090324","rel_abs":"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that began in late December 2019 has resulted in millions of cases diagnosed worldwide. Reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 shows extremely higher infection rates than other coronaviruses. This study conducted a phylogenetics analysis of 91 representative coronaviruses and found that the functional spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which interacts with the human receptor ACE2, is actually not undergoing distinct selection pressure compared to other coronaviruses. Furthermore, we define a new measurement, infection group differential (IGD) score, in assessing the infection ability of two human coronavirus groups. There are nine extremely high IGD (ehIGD) sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) out of 40 high IGD (hIGD) sites that exhibit a unique infection-related pattern from the haplotype network and docking energy comparison. These 40 hIGD sites are basically conserved among the SARS-CoV-2, i.e. there are only two hIGD sites mutated in four out of 1,058 samples, defined as rare-mutation hIGD (rhIGD) sites. In conclusion, ehIGD and rhIGD sites might be of great significance to the development of vaccines.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziwei Song","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines,   School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Xingchen Zhou","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Cai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Shou Feng","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Tingting Zhang","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Yun Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Maode Lai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Amy Flaxman","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marta Ulaszewska","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Friederike Feldmann","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Allen","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hannah Sharpe","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Schulz","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Myndi Holbrook","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.092163","rel_title":"A Computational Toolset for Rapid Identification of SARS-CoV-2, other Viruses, and Microorganisms from Sequencing Data","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.092163","rel_abs":"In this paper, we present a toolset and related resources for rapid identification of viruses and microorganisms from short-read or long-read sequencing data. We present fastv as an ultra-fast tool to detect microbial sequences present in sequencing data, identify target microorganisms, and visualize coverage of microbial genomes. This tool is based on the k-mer mapping and extension method. K-mer sets are generated by UniqueKMER, another tool provided in this toolset. UniqueKMER can generate complete sets of unique k-mers for each genome within a large set of viral or microbial genomes. For convenience, unique k-mers for microorganisms and common viruses that afflict humans have been generated and are provided with the tools. As a lightweight tool, fastv accepts FASTQ data as input, and directly outputs the results in both HTML and JSON formats. Prior to the k-mer analysis, fastv automatically performs adapter trimming, quality pruning, base correction, and other pre-processing to ensure the accuracy of k-mer analysis. Specifically, fastv provides built-in support for rapid SARS-CoV-2 identification and typing. Experimental results showed that fastv achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from sequencing data; and can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS, MERS, and other coronaviruses.

In response to the present crisis, understanding the molecular basis of comorbidity is essential to accelerate the development of potential drugs. To address this, we have measured the genetic association between COVID19 and various lung disorders and observed a remarkable resemblance. 141 lung disorders directly or indirectly linked to COVID19 result in a high-density disease-disease association network that shows a small-world property. The clustering of many lung diseases with COVID19 demonstrates a greater complexity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our results show that the functional protein-protein interaction modules involved RNA and protein metabolism, substantially hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, are connected to several lung disorders. Therefore we recommend targeting the components of these modules to inhibit the viral growth and improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asim Bikas Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Warangal"},{"author_name":"Changshou He","author_inst":"HaploX Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yingqiang Li","author_inst":"HaploX Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Charles E Melancon III","author_inst":"HaploX Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yun Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Maode Lai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Amy Flaxman","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marta Ulaszewska","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Friederike Feldmann","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Allen","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hannah Sharpe","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Schulz","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Myndi Holbrook","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.092379","rel_title":"Comparison of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 Test with a Laboratory-Developed Assay for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Clinical Nasopharyngeal Specimens","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.092379","rel_abs":"BackgroundSeveral point-of-care (POC) molecular tests have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use.\n\nObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nStudy designThe performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohens kappa coefficient.\n\nResultsOverall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI 53.3 to 80.5%) and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).\n\nConclusionCompared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine A.

Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAnalysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and\/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nNext, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nComparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population.\n\nIn conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristel Klaassen","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Biljana Stankovic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Branka Zukic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Nikola Kotur","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Gasic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Sonja Pavlovic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Maja Stojiljkovic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

The comparisons of Mpro in different states reveal that substrate binding site and the active site are more flexible in the inactive conformation than that in the active conformations. Notably, compared with the active conformation of the apo state structure in pH7.6 of SARS, the SARS-CoV-2 apo state is in the inactive conformation under condition close to physiological state (pH7.5). Two water molecules are present in the oxyanion hole in our apo state structure, whereas in the ligand-bound structure, water molecular is absence in the same region. This structure provides novel and important insights that have broad implications for understanding the structural basis underlying enzyme activity, and can facilitate rational, structure-based, approaches for the design of specific SARS-CoV-2 ligands as new therapeutic agents.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuelan Zhou","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Fanglin Zhong","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR, China."},{"author_name":"Cheng Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Crystalo Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518118, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Hu","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Affliated Hospital Of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Bing Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Medicinal Chemistry , Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica,Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road , Shanghai 201203 , China."},{"author_name":"Xiushan Yin","author_inst":"Shenyang University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jinheng Fu","author_inst":"Jiangxi-OAI Joint Research Institution, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330047, China."},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094151","rel_title":"The British Thoracic Society survey of rehabilitation to support recovery of the Post Covid -19 population.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094151","rel_abs":"Objectives Those discharged from hospital after treatment for Covid-19 are likely to have significant and ongoing symptoms, functional impairment and psychological disturbances. There is an immediate need to develop a safe and efficient discharge process and recovery programme. Pulmonary rehabilitation is well placed to deliver a rehabilitation programme for this group but will most likely need to be adapted for the post Covid-19 population. The purpose of this survey was to rapidly identify the components of a post-Covid-19 rehabilitation assessment and elements of a successful rehabilitation programme that would be required to deliver a comprehensive service for those post Covid-19 to inform service delivery. Design A survey comprising a series of closed questions and a free text comments box allowing for a qualitative analysis. Setting Online survey. Participants British Thoracic Society members and multi-professional clinicians, across specialities were invited to take part. Results 1031 participants responded from a broad range of specialities over 6 days. There was overwhelming support for early post discharge from hospital phase of the recovery programme to advise patients about the management of fatigue (95% agreed\/ strongly agreed), breathlessness (94%), and mood disturbances (including symptoms of anxiety and depression) 92%. At the 6-8-week time point an assessment was considered important, focusing on the assessment of a broad range of possible symptoms and the need to potentially return to work. Recommendations for the intervention described a holistic programme focusing on symptom management, return of function and return to employment. The free text comments added depth to the survey and the need not to reinvent the wheel rather adapt well established (pulmonary rehabilitation) services to accommodate the needs of the post Covid-19 population. Conclusion The responses indicate the huge interest and the urgent need establish a programme to support and mitigate the long term impact of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sally J Singh","author_inst":"University of Leicester; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Amy C Barradell","author_inst":"University of Leicester; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil J Greening","author_inst":"University of Leicester, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Charlotte E Bolton","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Louise Preston","author_inst":"British Thoracic Society"},{"author_name":"John R Hurst","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jinheng Fu","author_inst":"Jiangxi-OAI Joint Research Institution, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330047, China."},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rehabilitation medicine and physical therapy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095364","rel_title":"Capsid integrity quantitative PCR to determine virus infectivity in environmental and food applications; a systematic review","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095364","rel_abs":"Capsid integrity quantitative PCR (qPCR), a molecular detection method for infectious viruses combining azo dye pretreatment with qPCR, has been widely used in recent years; however, variations in pretreatment conditions for various virus types can limit the efficacy of specific protocols. By identifying and critically synthesizing 42 recent peer-reviewed studies employing capsid integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its derivates between 10 and 200 uM; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 to 25C) for 5 to 120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 to 800 Watts) exposure for periods ranging from 5 to 20 min. These simple steps can benefit the investigation of infectious virus transmission in routine (water) monitoring settings and during viral outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 pandemic or endemic diseases like dengue fever.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mats Leifels","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Life Science Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cheng Dan","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Life Science Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Sozzi","author_inst":"Gillings School of Global Public Health, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA"},{"author_name":"David C Shoults","author_inst":"Civil and Resource Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Singapore Centre for Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Skorn Mongkolsuk","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"},{"author_name":"Kwanrawee Sirikanchana","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"},{"author_name":"Jinheng Fu","author_inst":"Jiangxi-OAI Joint Research Institution, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330047, China."},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094748","rel_title":"COVID-19 Outbreak, Social Response, and Early Economic Effects: A Global VAR Analysis of Cross-Country Interdependencies","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094748","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of countries' interconnections in understanding and reacting to the spread of the virus. This paper uses a global model with a sample of 41 countries to study the interdependencies between COVID-19 health shocks, populations' risk perceptions about the disease, and their social distancing responses; it also provides some early evidence about potential economic effects. Social networks are a central component in understanding the international transmission. We exploit a dataset on existing social connections across country borders, made available by Facebook, and show that social networks help explain not only the spread of the disease, but also cross-country spillovers in risk perceptions and in social behavior. Social distancing responses across countries are measured based on aggregated mobility tracking indicators, obtained from Google Mobility Reports. We estimate a Global VAR (GVAR) model, which allows for endogeneity of each health, social, and economic, domestic variable, and for a dependence of domestic variables on country-specific foreign aggregates, which depend in turn on the matrix of social connections. Our empirical results highlight the importance of cross-country interdependencies and social networks. Risk perceptions and social responses are affected by experiences abroad, with Italy and the U.S. playing large roles in our sample. The social distancing responses to domestic health shocks are heterogeneous across countries, but they share some similarities: they adjust only gradually and with delay, hence displaying adaptive behavior. Early indicators are suggestive of unemployment consequences that vary widely across countries, depending on their labor market characteristics. Unemployment is particularly responsive to health shocks in the U.S. and Spain, while the fluctuations are attenuated almost everywhere else.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabio Milani","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Cheng Dan","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Life Science Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Sozzi","author_inst":"Gillings School of Global Public Health, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA"},{"author_name":"David C Shoults","author_inst":"Civil and Resource Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Singapore Centre for Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Skorn Mongkolsuk","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"},{"author_name":"Kwanrawee Sirikanchana","author_inst":"Research Laboratory of Biotechnology, Chulabhorn Research Institute and Center of Excellence on Environmental Health and Toxicology, CHE, Ministry of Education,"},{"author_name":"Jinheng Fu","author_inst":"Jiangxi-OAI Joint Research Institution, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330047, China."},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094573","rel_title":"Development and validation of the COVID-19 severity index (CSI): a prognostic tool for early respiratory decompensation","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094573","rel_abs":"Objective: The goal of this study was to create a predictive model of early hospital respiratory decompensation among patients with COVID-19. Design: Observational, retrospective cohort study. Setting: Nine-hospital health system within the Northeastern United States. Populations: Adult patients ([&ge;] 18 years) admitted from the emergency department who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) up to 24 hours after initial presentation. Patients meeting criteria for critical respiratory illness within 4 hours of arrival were excluded. Main outcome and performance measures: We used a composite endpoint of respiratory critical illness as defined by oxygen requirement beyond low-flow nasal cannula (e.g., non-rebreather mask, high-flow nasal cannula, bi-level positive pressure ventilation), intubation, or death within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. We developed predictive models using patient demographic and clinical data collected during those first 4 hours. Eight hospitals were used for development and internal validation (n=932) and 1 hospital for model external validation (n=240). Predictive variables were identified using an ensemble approach that included univariate regression, random forest, logistic regression with LASSO, Chi-square testing, gradient boosting information gain, and gradient boosting Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values prior to manual curation. We generated two predictive models, a quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) that uses only exam and vital sign measurements, and a COVID-19 severity index (CSI) machine learning model. Using area under receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC), precision-recall curves (AU-PRC) and calibration metrics, we compare the qCSI and CSI to three illness scoring systems: Elixhauser mortality score, qSOFA, and CURB-65. We present performance of qCSI and CSI on an external validation cohort. Results: During the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19. Six-hundred and twenty patients were excluded based on age or critical illness within the first 4 hours, yielding 1172 patients in the final cohort. Of these patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours. The qCSI (AU-ROC: 0.90 [0.85-0.96]) comprised of nasal cannula flow rate, respiratory rate, and minimum documented pulse oximetry outperformed the baseline models (qSOFA: 0.76 [0.69-0.85]; Elixhauser: 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; CURB-65: AU-ROC 0.66 [0.58-0.77]) and was validated on an external cohort (AU-ROC: 0.82). The machine learning-based CSI had superior performance on the training cohort (AU-ROC: 0.91 [0.86-0.97]), but was unlikely to provide practical improvements in clinical settings. Conclusions: A significant proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients decompensate within 24 hours of hospital presentation and these events are accurately predicted using respiratory exam findings within a simple scoring system.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Haimovich","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Neal G Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Stoytcho Stoytchev","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"H Patrick Young","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francis P Wilson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20092080","rel_title":"SELF-POLICING COVID-19 AND CIVIC RESPONSIBILITIES IN LAGOS METROPOLIS, NIGERIA","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20092080","rel_abs":"This study investigated self-policing COVID-19 and civic responsibilities in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria adopting an online qualitative interview due to the current lockdown that denied field (face to face) interview.

There could be a crisis (such as hunger) and the breakdown of law and order if the government does not increase their capacity to mitigate the hardship which the ongoing lockdown has imposed on the people.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayomide Ilori","author_inst":"University of Ibadan"},{"author_name":"Neal G Ravindra","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Stoytcho Stoytchev","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"H Patrick Young","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francis P Wilson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095521","rel_title":"Expected impact of reopening schools after lockdown on COVID-19 epidemic in Ile-de-France","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095521","rel_abs":"As several countries around the world are planning exit strategies to progressively lift the rigid social restrictions implemented with lockdown, different options are being chosen regarding the closure or reopening of schools. We evaluate the expected impact of reopening schools in lIe-de-France region after the withdrawal of lockdown currently scheduled for May 11, 2020. We explore several scenarios of partial, progressive, or full school reopening, coupled with moderate social distancing interventions and large-scale tracing, testing, and isolation. Accounting for current uncertainty on the role of children in COVID-19 epidemic, we test different hypotheses on children's transmissibility distinguishing between younger children (pre-school and primary school age) and adolescents (middle and high school age). Reopening schools after lifting lockdown will likely lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the following 2 months, even with lower transmissibility of children, yet protocols exist that would allow maintaining the epidemic under control without saturating the healthcare system. With pre-schools and primary schools in session starting May 11, ICU occupation would reach at most 72% [55,83]% (95% probability ranges) of a 1,500-bed capacity (here foreseen as the routine capacity restored in the region post-first wave) if no other school level reopens before summer or if middle and high schools reopen one month later through a progressive protocol (increasing attendance week by week). Full attendance of adolescents at school starting in June would overwhelm the ICU system (138% [118,159]% occupation). Reopening all schools on May 11 would likely lead to a second wave similar to the one recently experienced, except if maximum attendance is limited to 50% for both younger children and adolescents. Based on the estimated situation on May 11, no substantial difference in the epidemic risk is predicted between progressive and prompt reopening of pre-schools and primary schools, thus allowing full attendance of younger children mostly in need of resuming learning and development. Reopening would require however large-scale trace and testing to promptly isolate cases, in addition to moderate social distancing interventions. Full attendance in middle and high schools is instead not recommended. Findings are consistent across different assumptions on the relative transmissibility of younger children and for small increase of the reproductive number possibly due to decreasing compliance to lockdown.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Di Domenico","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Chiara E.

Methods We thus challenged environmental versus genetic evolution models of COVID-19 spreading, in the largest epidemiological analysis conducted as yet. This was performed over 168,089 laboratory-confirmed infection cases in Italy, Spain and Scandinavia. Landmark dates were set for each of the countries analyzed at peak diffusion rates this date, and the doubling time versus cumulative number of diagnoses was computed. Diffusion data in Germany, France and UK constituted the validation dataset of our model, over 210,239 additional cases. Mutations and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 versus COVID-19 spreading were analyzed at nextstrain.org\/ncov\/europe. Results The mean doubling time of COVID-19 was 6.63 days in northern Italy, 5.87 days in central areas, and 5.38 days in southern Italy, for shorter COVID-19 doubling time in warmer regions. Spain extended this trend, with a mean COVID-19 doubling time of 4.2 days. Slower diffusion across progressively colder regions was observed in Scandinavia, with 9.4 days COVID-19 doubling time in Sweden, 10.8 days in Finland and 12.95 days in Norway. Such diffusion model was supported by SARS-CoV-2 mutation strings upon sequential diffusion across the North\/South gradient. Conclusions Our findings indicate COVID-19 association to a sharp North\/South climate gradient, with faster spreading in southern regions. Thus, warmer climate conditions may not limit SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. Very cold regions may be better spared by recurrent courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saverio Alberti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Roberta Di Pietro","author_inst":"University of Chieti-Pescara"},{"author_name":"Mariangela Basile","author_inst":"University of Chieti-Pescara"},{"author_name":"Laura Antolini","author_inst":"University of Milano Bicocca"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095273","rel_title":"Evolution of the COVID Pandemic: A Technique for Mathematical Analysis of Data","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095273","rel_abs":"The analysis of COVID-19 statistics in different regions of the world with the intention of understanding the trend of progression of the pandemic is a task of paramount importance.

Methods: We report preliminary results from the Vall dHebron prospective cohort study at Vall dHebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others. Results: 82 patients with COVID19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean (SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) ageadjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1 to 4) points.

It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 meeting the criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) have experienced recurrent PCR positivity. However, the clinical course and risk factors for these patients have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR from the Guanggu Branch of Hubei Province Maternity and Childcare Hospital from February 24, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were enrolled. The epidemiological, radiographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from medical records. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to elucidate risk factors for patients with recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results 1087 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Of these, 20 (1.8%) died and 1067 (98.2%) were discharged from the hospital. Among the discharged cases, there were 81 (7.6%) patients found to develop a repeat positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA result. Older age was obviously associated with death. For patients with recurrent RT-PCR positivity, the median duration from illness onset to onset of complete RNA negative was 33.0 days (range, 6.0-82.0 days; IQR, 20.0-41.0 days), while that from illness onset to recurrence was 50.0 days (range, 21.0-95.0 days; IQR, 36.5-59.5 days). Multivariate regression analysis identified recurrence of positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA was associated with elevated IL-6 levels (P=0.004, OR=3.050; 95% CI, 1.432-6.499), increased lymphocyte count (P=0.038, OR=2.321; 95% CI, 1.048-5.138) and CT imaging features of lung consolidation (P=0.038, OR=1.641; 95% CI, 1.028-2.620) during hospitalization. Conclusion Elevated lymphocyte counts and IL-6 levels in blood, and consolidation features on CT imaging are useful risk factors for clinicians to identify patients at risk of developing recurrent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This is speculated to be caused by a balance in immune regulation when fighting virus toxicity. For patients with a high risk of recurrent positivity, a prolonged observation and additional preventative measures should be implemented for at least 50 days after illness onset to prevent future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Chen","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Xu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jing Hu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Qiangda Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Fengfeng Xu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hui Liang","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Nanmei Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hengmei Zhu","author_inst":"Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Naval Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinlong Lan","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Lan Zhou","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jiajun Xing","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ning Pu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Cai","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Salvador Augustin","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Hepatology Department"},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094839","rel_title":"Compassionate drug (mis)use during pandemics: lessons for COVID-19 from 2009.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094839","rel_abs":"Background: New emerging infections have no known treatment. Assessing potential drugs for safety and efficacy enables clinicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions, and contributes to overall outbreak control. However, it is difficult to launch clinical trials in the unpredictable environment of an outbreak. We conducted a bibliometric systematic review for the 2009 influenza pandemic to determine the speed, and quality of evidence generation for treatments. This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. Methods: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. Results: 33869 treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. 592 patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results were available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. Conclusion: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture. The result was a reliance on use under compassionate circumstances, resulting in continued uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and harms of anti-viral treatment. Rapid scaling of clinical trials is critical for generating a quality evidence base during pandemics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Rojek","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Martin","author_inst":"Alfred Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Qiangda Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Fengfeng Xu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hui Liang","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Nanmei Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Hengmei Zhu","author_inst":"Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Naval Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinlong Lan","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Lan Zhou","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jiajun Xing","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ning Pu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Cai","author_inst":"Naval Medical Center of PLA"},{"author_name":"Salvador Augustin","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Hepatology Department"},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094805","rel_title":"Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces and in human excreta","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094805","rel_abs":"At room temperature, SARS-CoV-2 was stable on environmental surfaces and remained viable up to 7 days on smooth surfaces.

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 has been reported; however, there are limited researches that investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the Middle East. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID19 in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study is a retrospective single-centre case series study. We extracted data for patients who were admitted to the Al-Noor Specialist hospital with a PCR confirmed SARS-COV-2 between 12th and 31st of March 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patients characteristics. Continuous data were reported as mean (SD). Chi-squared test\/Fisher test were used as appropriate to compare proportions for categorical variables. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were hospitalised for COVID-19 during the study period. The mean age was 46.1 years (SD: 15.3 years). Around 61.0% (n= 90) were males and six patients (3.9%) reported working in the healthcare sector. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (28.8%, n= 42) and diabetes mellitus (26.0%, n= 38). The majority of the patients, 64.4% (n = 96) had a recent contact history with a COVID patient. Regarding the severity of the hospitalised patients, 105 patients (70.0%) were mild, 29 (19.3%) were moderate, and 16 patients (10.7%) were severe or required ICU care. From the 105 mild patients, around 31.3% (n= 47) were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This case series provides clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed Shabrawishi","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Manal M Al-Gethamy","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Abdallah Y Naser","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman, Jordan."},{"author_name":"Mahe A Ghazawi","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ghaidaa F Alsharif","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Elaf F Obaid","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Haitham A Melebari","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, King Faisal General Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095042","rel_title":"Lactate arterial-central venous gradient among COVID-19 patients in ICU: a potential tool in the clinical practice.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095042","rel_abs":"Objective. In physiological conditions arterial blood lactate concentration is equal or lower than central venous. The aim of this study was to explore if the COVID-19 induced lung cells damage was mirrored by an arterial lactatemia higher than the central venous one; then if the administration of immunosuppressant drugs (i.e. canakinumab) could normalize such abnormal lactate a-cv difference. Methods. Prospective cohort study started on March 25th 2020 for a duration of 10 days, enrolling 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation consecutively admitted to the ICU of the Rimini Hospital, Italy. Arterial and central venous blood samples were contemporary collected to calculate the difference between arterial and central venous lactate (Delta a-cv lactate) concentration within 24 h from tracheal intubation (T0), and 24 hours after canakinumab administration (T1). Results. At the T0 19\/21 (90.5%) patients showed a pathologic Delta a-cv lactate (median 0.22 mmol\/L; IQR 0.07-0.36), suggesting severe inflammation. In the 13 patients undergoing canakinumab administration, at the T1 Delta a-cv lactate decreased in 92.3% of cases, being the decrease statistically significant (T0: median 0.15, IQR 0.07-0.25 mmol\/L; T1: median -0.01, IQR -0.09-0.04 mmol\/L; p=0.002). Conclusion. A reversed Delta a-cv lactate is likely to be one of the effects of COVID-19 related cytokine storm, that could reflect a derangement in the lung cells mitochondrial metabolism induced by inflammation or other uncoupling mediators. Delta a-cv lactate decrease may reflect the anti-inflammatory activity of canakinumab. Our preliminary findings need to be confirmed by larger outcome studies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe Nardi","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Sanson","author_inst":"University of Trieste (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Lucia Tassinari","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Guiotto","author_inst":"AORN San Pio, Benevento (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20094979","rel_title":"Estimation of the number of general anesthesia cases based on a series of nationwide surveys on Twitter during COVID-19 in Japan: A statistical analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20094979","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has since spread to more than 200 other countries at the time of writing.

Social networks such as Twitter are becoming a part of society, as various information is accumulated on the web. One of the services provided by Twitter is a voting function-Twitter Polls-through which anonymous surveys can be conducted. We analyzed the results of a series of surveys on Twitter on the status of operating restrictions using a mathematical model, and public data provided by the Japanese Government were used to estimate the current and future changes in the number of general anesthesia performed in Japan.

The new virus is rapidly spreading in humans and cases of severe acute respiratory syndromes are being reported worldwide. Health authority advisors and governments from small towns to large countries need to quickly manage and deal with growing epidemiological data on a daily basis. In this work, current available data from reported cases and deaths over time were analyzed and treated. Lethality has been calculated by finding linearization of death cases against reported ones, using a time-delayed data transposition. A two-wave statistical model, 2WM, based on the superposition of normal distributions was used to fit current data and to estimate the evolution of infections and deaths, using Microsoft Excel(R). The model showed good agreement even for apparent single wave behavior in some countries and can easily be extended to any number of waves. A gamma distribution was used as a risk function to estimate death probability from patient admission to reported death. Evolution of fatality cases over time can then be estimated from the model with reasonable accuracy. Data from South Korea, China, Australia, Germany, Italy and Spain were used to validate the model. Data from The United States, United Kingdom and Brazil were used to study the epidemiology as the pandemic progresses. Additionally, the 2WM was applied to world data and to the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The model was implemented in MS-Excel, a popular and easy to use analytical tool. A template spreadsheet is provided as supplementary material. Constant lethality can be determined from the initial stage of the pandemic wave. Values ranged from 1.7% to 15.3%, depending on the degree of possible sub notification cases. Even for places with low testing, a linear relationship can be found. The two-wave model can be fine-tuned to properly adjust the data. The second wave pattern was estimated according to the first wave parameter. The accuracy for estimating COVID-19 evolution was compared to the classic SIR model with good agreement. According to the model, based on current trends, health protocols and policies, approximately 10,000,000 cases and 860,000 deaths will be recorded worldwide. Approximately 99% of that number would be reached by the end of July 2020 given constant conditions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agenor De Noni Jr.","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Bernando Araldi da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Felipe Dal-Pizzol","author_inst":"University of the Extreme South of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Luismar Marques Porto","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095505","rel_title":"Significant Relaxation of SARS-CoV-2-Targeted Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Will Result in Profound Mortality: A New York State Modelling Study","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095505","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) is the most significant global health crisis of the 21st century.

Simulations revealed dramatic infectivity driven by undocumented infections, and a peak basic reproductive number in NYS of 5.7. NPIs have been effective, and relaxation >50% will result in tens-of-thousands more deaths. Endemic infection is likely to occur in the absence of profound sustained immunity.

By supplementing the Greek data for deaths with the data for the number of individuals reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, we estimated the effect on deaths and infections in the case that the easing of the lockdown measures is different for these two subpopulations. We found that if the lockdown measures are eased only for the young subpopulation, then the effect on deaths and infections is small; however, if the easing is substantial for the older population, this effect may be catastrophic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Athanasios S.

We developed a Bayesian framework for the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model (Bayesian SIR), and estimated its underlying parameters based on day-by-day timeseries of the cumulative number of infectious individuals. The new Bayesian framework extends the deterministic SIR model to a probabilistic form, which provides an accurate estimation of the underlying system by a short and noisy data. We applied it to the data reported on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and made a month long prediction on its evolution. Our simulated test using past timeseries to predict the current data gives a reasonable reliability of the proposed method. Our analysis of the current data detected and warned a rising trend in the countries in Central Asia, Middle East, and South America, while United States or European countries, which have already experienced large numbers of infected cases, are predicted to slow down in the increase.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shohei Hidaka","author_inst":"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Takuma Torii","author_inst":"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Panayotis G.

The number of cases follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion; we chose as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and we used 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth. We looked then for linear correlations of the exponents with other variables, for a sample of 126 countries. We find a positive correlation, faster spread of COVID-19 , with high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low Temperature (4x10 -7), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3x10 -6), life expectancy (8x10 -6), number of international tourists (1x10 -5), earlier epidemic starting date (2x10 -5), high level of physical contact in greeting habits (6x10 -5), lung cancer prevalence (6x10 -5), obesity in males (1x10 -4), share of population in urban areas (2x10 -4), cancer prevalence (3x10 -4), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), UV index (0.004, smaller sample, 73 countries), low Vitamin D serum levels (0.002-0.006, smaller sample, 50 countries). There is highly significant correlation also with blood type: positive correlation with types RH- (2x10 -5) and A+ (2x10 -3), negative correlation with B+ (2x10 -4). We also find positive correlation with moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02-0.03) with: CO2\/SO emissions, type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). Several of the above variables are correlated with each other and so they are likely to have common interpretations. Other variables are found to have a counterintuitive negative correlation, which may be explained due their strong negative correlation with life expectancy: slower spread of COVID-19 is correlated with high death-rate due to pollution, prevalence of anemia and hepatitis B, high blood pressure in females. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per capita, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessio Notari","author_inst":"Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Torrieri","author_inst":"Unicamp, Campinas, SP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"George A Kastis","author_inst":"Academy of Athens"},{"author_name":"Luismar Marques Porto","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095356","rel_title":"Global analysis of daily new COVID-19 cases reveals many static-phase countries including US and UK potentially with unstoppable epidemics","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095356","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 epidemics are differentially progressing in different countries.

In particular, the 12 static-phase countries including US and UK are characterized by largely constant numbers of daily new cases in the past over 14 days. Furthermore, these static-phase countries are overall significantly lower in testing density but higher in the level of positive COVID-19 tests than downward countries. These findings suggest that the testing capacity in static-phase countries is lagging behind the spread of the outbreak, i.e., daily new cases (confirmed) are likely less than daily new infections and the remaining undocumented infections are thus still expanding, resulting in unstoppable epidemics. As such, increasing the testing capacity and\/or reducing the COVID-19 transmission are urgently needed to stop the severing crisis in static-phase countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"XINMIAO FU","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Torrieri","author_inst":"Unicamp, Campinas, SP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"George A Kastis","author_inst":"Academy of Athens"},{"author_name":"Luismar Marques Porto","author_inst":"Federal University of Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Antonella Potalivo","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Montomoli","author_inst":"Infermi Hospital, Rimini (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Fernando Schiraldi","author_inst":"San Paolo Hospital, Naples (Italy)"},{"author_name":"Dhaffer M Alamri","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Control Programme, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad S Brinji","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Fawaz H Al Jehani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Wail Almaimani","author_inst":"Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Rakan A Ekram","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Informatics, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Kasim H Alkhatib","author_inst":"Intensive Care Department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Julia Sampol","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pneumology Department"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Guillen-del-Castillo","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Systemic Diseases Division"},{"author_name":"Benito Almirante","author_inst":"Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Depratment"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
