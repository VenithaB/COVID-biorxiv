The containment measures for this disease such as the requirement of health care facilities greatly rely on estimating the future dynamics and flattening of the COVID-19 curve. However, it is always challenging to estimate the future trends and flattening of the COVID-19 curve due to the involvement of many real-life variables. Recently, traditional methods based on SIR and SEIR have been presented for predictive monitoring and detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve. In this paper, a novel method for detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve and its ending life-cycle using only the time-series of new cases per day is presented. Simulation results are compared to the SIR based methods in three different scenarios using COVID-19 curves for South Korea, the United States of America, and India. In this study, simulations, performed on the 26th April 2020 show that the peak of the COVID-19 curve in the USA has already arrived and situated on the 14th of April 2020, while the peak of the COVID-19 curve for India has yet to arrive.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr. Praveen Gupta","author_inst":"Government Polytechnic College, Jaipur"},{"author_name":"Prof.  K.K.

However, using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significative economic and societal costs. Here we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating epidemic outbreaks. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the desired maximum of disease prevalence and the maximum decrease of disease transmission that the interventions can achieve. We study the implications of our theoretical results for designing non-pharmaceutical interventions in 16 cities and regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of each region's contact rate necessary to control the epidemic optimally. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to guide the design of optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention policies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Tulio Angulo","author_inst":"CONACyT - Institute of Mathematics, UNAM."},{"author_name":"Fernando Casta\u00f1os","author_inst":"Department of Automatic Control, CINVESTAV-IPN"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Moreno-Morton","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Faculty of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jorge X.

Many factors may be involved in the transmission of this deadly disease but not much-supporting data are available. Till now no proper evidences has been reported supporting that temperature changes can affect COVID-19 transmission. This work aims to correlate the effect of temperature with that of Total Cases, Recovery, Death, and Critical cases all around the globe. All the data were collected in April and the maximum and minimum temperature and the average temperature were collected from January to April (i.e the months during which the disease was spread). Regression was conducted to find a non-linear relationship between Temperate and the cases. It was evident that indeed temperature does have a significant effect on the total cases and recovery rate around the globe. It was also evident from the study that the countries with lower temperatures are the hotspots for COVID-19. The Study depicted a non-linear dose-response between temperature and the transmission, indicating the existence of the best temperature for its transmission. This study can indeed put some light on how temperature can be a significant factor in COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pratik Das","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Suvendu Manna","author_inst":"University of Petroleum and Energy Studies"},{"author_name":"Piyali Basak","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Jorge X.

As COVID-19 mortality occurs mainly in elderly and as Africa has a comparably young population, the death rates should be lower than on other continents. We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) using age-specific case fatality rates for COVID-19 and the age structure of the population of Africa and of other continents. Compared to a European or Northern American population, the standardised mortality ratio was only 0.22 and 0.25, respectively, corresponding to reduction of deaths rates to a quarter. Compared to the Asian and Latin American & Caribbean population, the SMR was 0.43 and 0.44, respectively, corresponding to half the death rate for Africa. It is useful to quantify the isolated effect of the African age-structure on potential COVID-19 mortality for illustrative and communication purposes, keeping in mind the importance of public health measures that have been shown to be effective in reducing cases and deaths. The different aspect of age pyramids of a European and an African population are striking and the potential implications for the pandemic are often discussed but rarely quantified.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrice Mougeni","author_inst":"Centre de Recherches Medicales de Lambarene (CERMEL), Gabon"},{"author_name":"Ance Mangaboula","author_inst":"Centre de Recherches Medicales de Lambarene (CERMEL), Gabon"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Lell","author_inst":"CERMEL and Department of Medicine I, Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Jorge X.

We propose three contributions: a) ICUBAM (ICU Bed Availability Monitor), a tool which both collects and visualizes information on CCB availability entered directly by intensivists. b) An analysis of CCB availability and ICU admissions and outcomes using collected by \\ICUBAM during a 6-week period in the hard-hit Grand Est region of France, and c) Explanatory and predictive models adapted to CCB availability prediction, and fitted to availability information collected by ICUBAM. Methods: We interact directly with intensivists twice a day, by sending a SMS with a web link to the ICUBAM form where they enter 8 numbers: number of free and occupied CCBs (ventilator-equipped) for both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19- negative patients, the number of COVID-19 related ICU deaths and discharges, the number of ICU refusals, and the number of patients transferred to another region due to bed shortages. The collected data are described using univariate and multivariate methods such as correspondence analysis and then modeled at different scales: a medium and long term prediction using SEIR models, and a short term statistical model to predict the number of CCBs. Results: ICUBAM was brought online March 25, and is currently being used in the Grand-Est region by 109 intensivists representing 40 ICUs (95% of ICUs). ICUBAM allows for the calculation of CCB availability, admission and discharge statistics. Our analysis of data describes the evolution and extent of the COVID-19 health crisis in the Grand-Est region: on April 6th, at maximum bed capacity, 1056 ventilator-equipped CCBs were present, representing 211% of the nominal regional capacity of 501 beds. From March 19th to March 31st, average daily COVID-19 ICU inflow was 68 patients\/day, and 314 critical care patients were transferred out of the Grand-Est region. With French lockdown starting on March 17th, a decrease of the daily inflow was found starting on April 1st: 23 patients\/day during the first fortnight of April, and 7 patients\/day during the last fortnight. However, treatment time for COVID-19 occupied CCBs is long: 15 days after the peak on March 31st, only 20% of ICU beds have been freed (50% after 1 month). Region-wide COVID-19 related in-ICU mortality is evaluated at 31%. Models trained from ICUBAM data are able to describe and predict the evolution of bed usage for the Grand-Estregion. Conclusion: We observe strong uptake of the ICUBAM tool, amongst both physicians and local healthcare stakeholders (health agencies, first responders etc.). We are able to leverage data collected with ICUBAM to better understand the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Grand Est region. We also present how data ingested by ICUBAM can be used to anticipate CCB shortages and predict future admissions. Most importantly, we demonstrate the importance of having a cross-functional team involving physicians, statisticians and computer scientists working both with first-line medical responders and local health agencies. This allowed us to quickly implement effective tools to assist in critical decision-making processes.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- ICUBAM Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"julie josse","author_inst":"Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Philippe Bensaid","author_inst":"Hopital Argenteuil, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Bost bru","author_inst":"CHU Grenoble, France"},{"author_name":"Edeline Coinde","author_inst":"Hop Ajaccio,France"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Dessioux","author_inst":"Hop Pays du Mont Blanc, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Fournial","author_inst":"Hop Nantes, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Gashignard","author_inst":"Hop Robert Debre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Herve Haas","author_inst":"Hop Nice, France"},{"author_name":"Veronique Hentgen","author_inst":"Versailles Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Frederic Huet","author_inst":"Dijon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103515","rel_title":"The specificity of Japanese PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 exceeds 99.7%","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103515","rel_abs":"The Japanese government arranged a total of three charter flights to evacuate Japanese residents out of Wuhan Jan 29, 30, and 31, 2020.

This work proposes a scheme to monitor the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic using the time series of its total number of confirmed cases in a given region. The monitored parameter is the spread rate obtained from this time series (day-1) expressed in %\/day. The scheme's capability is verified using the epidemic data from China and South Korea. Its projection capability is shown for Italy and United States with scenarios for the ensuing 30 days from April 2nd, 2020. The spread rate (relative rate of change of the time series) is very sensitive to sudden changes in the epidemic evolution and can be used to monitor in real-time the effectiveness of containment actions. The logarithm of this variable allows identifying clear trends of the evolution of the COVID-10 epidemic in these countries. The spread rate calculated from the number of confirmed cases of infection is interpreted as a probability per unit of time of virus infection and containment actions. Its product with the number of confirmed cases of infections yields the number of new cases per day. The stabilization and control of the epidemic for China and South Korea appear to occur for values of this parameter below 0.77 %\/day (doubling time of 90 days).","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joao Manoel Losada Moreira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do ABC"},{"author_name":"julie josse","author_inst":"Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Philippe Bensaid","author_inst":"Hopital Argenteuil, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Bost bru","author_inst":"CHU Grenoble, France"},{"author_name":"Edeline Coinde","author_inst":"Hop Ajaccio,France"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Dessioux","author_inst":"Hop Pays du Mont Blanc, France"},{"author_name":"Cecile Fournial","author_inst":"Hop Nantes, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Gashignard","author_inst":"Hop Robert Debre, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Herve Haas","author_inst":"Hop Nice, France"},{"author_name":"Veronique Hentgen","author_inst":"Versailles Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Frederic Huet","author_inst":"Dijon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103655","rel_title":"Differential Effects of Intervention Timing on COVID-19 Spread in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103655","rel_abs":"Assessing the effects of early non-pharmaceutical interventions1-5 on COVID-19 spread in the United States is crucial for understanding and planning future control measures to combat the ongoing pandemic6-10.

Participants: 498 subjects, 80% women. Participation was offered to all the HCW of Emergencies, Intensive Care and Anesthesia, Internal Medicine and Pneumology. Other units not directly involved in the care of these patients were offered to participate. Intervention: naso and oropharyngeal PCR determination was performed together with IgG and IgM antibody determination by immunochromatography. On the day of sampling, a health questionnaire was answered, reporting symptoms on the same day and in the previous fourteen days. Main outcome measures: percentage of HCW with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, percentage of HCW with positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Two individuals were detected with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 positive (0.4%). Both were asymptomatic on the day of sampling, but one of them had had a CoVID-19 compatible picture in the previous two weeks and had positive IgG and IgM; therefore, only one subject was truly asymptomatic carrier (0.2%). 9 workers with positive IgG (1.8%) were detected.

Results: 111 patients were identified, of which 54 had received tocilizumab while 57 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (48.1% vs. 28.1%, p=0.029 and fungal (5.6% vs. 0%, p=0.112) infections. Consistent with higher number of infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (35.2% vs. 19.3%, p=0.020). Seven cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. Conclusions: Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas M Kimmig","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Wu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Matthew Gold","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Natasha N Pettit","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Pitrak","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Mueller","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Aliya N Husain","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Ece A Mutlu","author_inst":"Rush University"},{"author_name":"Gokhan M Mutlu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Veronique Hentgen","author_inst":"Versailles Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Frederic Huet","author_inst":"Dijon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103853","rel_title":"COVID-19 in London, a Case Series Demonstrating Late Improvement in Survivors","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103853","rel_abs":"Objective To determine whether the trajectories of survivors and non-survivors are different in patients admitted to intensive care in London.

There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19, in Chest X-ray and CT scan, however their availability in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised. At this moment, the role of Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has yet to be explored. OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to describe the POCUS findings of the disease in COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). Determining the correlation of these parameters with vital signs, laboratory results and chest X-ray, as well as, therapeutic decisions and prognosis. METHODS: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of two academic hospitals. High suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to the ultrasonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC), focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS), and Lung Ultrasonography (Lung POCUS). RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, ninety-six patients were enrolled. The mean age was 68.2 years (SD 17.5). The most common finding in Lung POCUS was an irregular pleural line (63.2%) followed by bilateral confluent (55.2%) and isolated B-lines (53.1%), which was associated with a positive RT-PCR (OR 4.729, 95% CI: 1.989-11.246; p<0.001), and correlated with IL-6 levels (rho = 0.622; p = 0.002). The IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p =0.014) and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p =0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509; p=0.03). After POCUS exam, almost 20% of the patients had an associated condition that required a change in the treatment or management. CONCLUSION: In this pandemic era, as the shortage of resources constitutes an undeniable public health threat, POCUS presents the potential to impact in diagnosis, management and prognosis of our confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"yale tung chen","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz.

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with data for the case study island nation of New Zealand (NZ) along with relevant parameters sourced from the NZ and international literature. This included a testing level for symptomatic cases of 7,800 tests per million people per week. Results: It was estimated to take between 27 and 33 days of no new detected cases for there to be a 95% probability of epidemic extinction. This was for effective reproduction numbers (Re) in the range of 0.50 to 1.0, which encompass such controls as case isolation (the shorter durations relate to low Re values). For a 99% probability of epidemic extinction, the equivalent time period was 37 to 44 days. In scenarios with lower levels of symptomatic cases seeking medical attention and lower levels of testing, the time period was up to 53 to 91 days (95% level). Conclusions: In the context of a high level of testing, a period of around one month of no new notified cases of COVID-19 would give 95% certainty that elimination of SARS-CoV-2 transmission had been achieved.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Parry","author_inst":"University of Otago, Dunedin"},{"author_name":"Ayesha J Verrall","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Michael G Baker","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Markus Schwehm","author_inst":"ExploSYS GmbH"},{"author_name":"Martin Eichner","author_inst":"Epimos GmbH"},{"author_name":"Suveer Singh","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Marcela Vizcaychipi","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104117","rel_title":"The role of age distribution, time lag between reporting and death and healthcare system capacity on case fatality estimates of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104117","rel_abs":"European countries report large differences in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case fatality risk (CFR).

We found that, first, a large proportion of the difference in CFRs can be attributed to different age structures of the cases. Second, lags of 5-10 days between day of case report and death should be used, since these provide the most constant estimates. Third, for France, Italy, and Spain, intensive care beds occupied by COVID-19 patients were positively associated with fatality risks of hospitalized cases. Our results highlight that cross-country comparisons of crude CFR estimates can be misleading and should be avoided.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Christian Wiessner","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Anja Holz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annika Moehl","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104182","rel_title":"COVID-19 Infection Forecasting based on Deep Learning in Iran","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104182","rel_abs":"Since December 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is outbreak from China and infected more than 4,666,000 people and caused thousands of deaths.

In the simplest case, the population is given a smaller fraction of 10-20% with higher susceptibility and the balance of 80-90% with lower susceptibility. Susceptibility is taken to include the level of immunity to the virus combined with the societal circumstances of certain smaller groups within a population. This is programmed numerically by considering a realistic random rate of contacts, together with an assumed constant viral genome. The remaining major variable is the societal response of nations to the outbreak, with earlier or later application of various degrees of lockdown, tracing and sanitation. China, South Korea and other nations, including Germany, have stopped or greatly slowed the spread of the disease before it could run its course through a whole population.

We consider an SEIRS model capturing saturated incidence with treatment response. In this theoretical model, we assumed that the treatment response is proportional to the number of infected as long as the incidence cases are within the capacity of the healthcare system, after which the value becomes constant, when the number of confirmed cases exceed the carrying capacity of the available medical facilities. Thus, we obtain the reproduction number stating that when R0 is less than a critical value R1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Also, we studied the existence of the local and global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria and found that the kind of treatment response and inhibitory measures deployed in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic determines whether the disease will die out or become endemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Adeyemi Oluyori","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Ahmadu  Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Helen O.

The Ongoing lockdown 3.0 is over on May 18th, 2020. We derived how the lockdown relaxation is going to impact on containment of the outbreak. Here the Exponential Growth Model has been used to derive the epidemic curve based on the data collected from February 11th 2020, to May 11th 2020, and the Machine Learning based Linear Regression model that gives the epidemic curve to predict the cases with the continuous flow of the lockdown. We estimate that if the lockdown is continuing with more relaxation, then the estimated infected cases reach up to 1.16 crores by June 30th 2020, and the lockdown would persist with current restriction, then the expected predicted infected cases are 5.69 lacs. The Exponential Growth Model and the Linear Regression Model are advantageous to predict the number of affected cases of COVID-19. These models can be used for forecasting in long term intervals.

Using a computer simulation, this paper analyses the probability of spreading of Corona virus through air among the people who are standing in a queue. The parameters such as the diameter of the virus particle, room temperature, relative humidity, height of the person, distance between the people and the waiting time in the queue are considered in the computer model to determine the distribution of Corona virus and hence identify the risk factor of spreading the Covid-19. This paper describes the possibilities of getting infectious when a Covid-19 infected person present in a queue and the impact on the waiting time and the position in the queue on the transmission of Corona virus.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santhosh Samuel Mathews","author_inst":"Amzetta"},{"author_name":"Satya Narayan Pati","author_inst":"Centurion University"},{"author_name":"Aashirbad Maharana","author_inst":"Centurion University"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annika Moehl","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104315","rel_title":"Modes of transmission of COVID-19 outbreak- a mathematical study","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104315","rel_abs":"The world has now paid a lot of attention to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity, therefore to the overwhelming of the healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate and cannot explain the magnitude of the variations in case-fatality rate reported per country by international organizations or information sites. These differences can only be explained by the systems for reporting cases and deaths, which, indeed, vary greatly from country to country, and not attributed to the care or treatment of patients, even during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc SOURIS","author_inst":"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD)"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Gonzalez","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Aashirbad Maharana","author_inst":"Centurion University"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annika Moehl","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103820","rel_title":"Analysis of temporal trends in potential COVID-19 cases reported through NHS Pathways England","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103820","rel_abs":"The NHS Pathways triage system collates data on enquiries to 111 and 999 services in England.

Trends in such reports over time are likely to reflect behaviour of the ongoing epidemic within the wider community, potentially capturing valuable information across a broader severity profile of cases than hospital admission data. We present a fully reproducible analysis of temporal trends in NHS Pathways reports until 14th May 2020, nationally and regionally, and demonstrate that rates of growth\/decline and effective reproduction number estimated from these data may be useful in monitoring transmission. This is a particularly pressing issue as lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted and evidence of disease resurgence must be constantly reassessed. We further assess the correlation between NHS Pathways reports and a publicly available NHS dataset of COVID-19-associated deaths in England, finding that enquiries to 111\/999 were strongly associated with daily deaths reported 16 days later. Our results highlight the potential of NHS Pathways as the basis of an early warning system. However, this dataset relies on self-reported symptoms, which are at risk of being severely biased.

The early hot spot states were New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The workforce in these states was required to work from home except for essential services. It was necessary to evaluate an appropriate date for resumption of business since the premature reopening of the economy would lead to a broader spread of COVID-19, while the opposite situation would cause greater loss of economy. To reflect the real-time risk of the spread of COVID-19, it was crucial to evaluate the population of infected individuals before or never being confirmed due to the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmissions of COVID-19. To this end, we proposed an epidemic model and applied it to evaluate the real-time risk of epidemic for the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. We used California as the benchmark state because California began a phased reopening on May 8, 2020. The dates on which the estimated numbers of unidentified infectious individuals per 100,000 for states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were close to those in California on May 8, 2020, were June 1, 22, and 22, 2020, respectively. By the practice in California, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut might consider reopening their business. Meanwhile, according to our simulation models, to prevent the resurgence of infections after reopening the economy, it would be crucial to maintain sufficient measures to limit the social distance after the resumption of businesses. This precaution turned out to be critical as the situation in California quickly deteriorated after our analysis was completed and its interventions after the reopening of business were not as effective as those in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianbin Tan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wiegel","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Heiko Becher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Michelle Hayes","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alice Sisson","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Keays","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103879","rel_title":"The Effects of Stringent Interventions for Coronavirus Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103879","rel_abs":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe public health consequences around the world.

Here we provide a forecasting model that is based on measurable variables and that strives for simplicity over complexity to obtain stable convergent forecasts of death, prevalence, incidence, and safe days for social easing. Methods: We assume, based on prior pandemic data, that death rate rise and fall approximately follows a Gaussian distribution, which can be asymmetric, which we describe. By taking daily death data for foreign countries and U.S. states and fitting it to an appropriate Gaussian function provides an estimate of where in the cycle a particular population lies. From that time point one can integrate remaining time to obtain a final total death. By also using measured values for the time from infection to recovery or death and a mortality factor, the prevalence (active cases) and incidence (new cases) totals and rate curves can be constructed. It is also possible by setting a downward threshold on prevalence that an estimate of a minimum date to begin relaxing social restrictions may be considered. Results: To demonstrate the model we chose the most severe hot-bed countries and U.S. states as a test-bed to evolve and improve our model and to compare with other models. The model can readily be applied to other countries by inputting data from public data bases. We also compare our forecasts to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model and are reassuringly similar yet show less variability on a weekly basis. The sum of squares for error (SSE) for international and U.S. states, respectively, that we track are: 26% and 26% for our model vs. 41% and 46% for the IHME model. Conclusions: Our model appears closest to the UW IHME model; however, there are important differences and while both models forecast many of the same results of interest, each one offers unique benefits that the other does not. We believe that the model reported here excels for its simplicity, which makes the model easy to use.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack A.

We sought to estimate the potential long-term epidemiological impact of such disruptions on TB burden in high-burden countries, and how this negative impact could be mitigated.

The anticipated level of disruption reflected consensus from a rapid expert consultation. We modelled the impact of these disruptions on TB incidence and mortality over the next five years, and also considered potential interventions to curtail this impact. Results Even temporary disruptions can cause long-term increases in TB incidence and mortality. We estimated that a 3-month lockdown, followed by 10 months to restore normal TB services, would cause, over the next 5 years, an additional 1.92 million TB cases (Crl 1.74 - 2.15) and 488,000 TB deaths (CrI 449 - 541 thousand) in India, 48,000 (33,400 - 72,320) TB cases and 16,800 deaths (11.9 - 21.9 thousand) in Kenya, and 9,100 (6,980 - 11,200) cases and 1,960 deaths (1,620 - 2,350) in Ukraine.

In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of Covid-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R_0). This also enables us to estimate the daily transmission rate ({beta}) that determines the effect of social distancing. We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on Covid-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 1.78. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from April 13 till 7 May 2020. The R_0 is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37, 2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below one. Also, the estimated fractional reported symptomatic cases are between 10 to 50%.

While countries are reopening the economies before the virus disappears, the system and capacity of testing and contact tracing should be carefully designed with the tracking of people behavior changes in the future.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongzhong Wu","author_inst":"South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Mianmian Huang","author_inst":"South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Guie Xie","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiangying Chen","author_inst":"South China Univerisity of Technology"},{"author_name":"Carel Pretorius","author_inst":"Avenir Health"},{"author_name":"Sevim Ahmedov","author_inst":"United States Agency for International Development"},{"author_name":"Sreenivas A Nair","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Andrei Mosneaga","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Enos O Masini","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sahu Suvanand","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Nimalan Arinaminpathy","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20102202","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Uganda: Predicting the impact of the disease and public health response on disease burden","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20102202","rel_abs":"Objective COVID-19 transmission and the public health lock-down response are now established in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. Population structure and prior morbidities differ markedly between these countries from those where outbreaks were previously established. We predicted the relative impact of COVID-19 and the response in Uganda to understand whether the benefits could be outweighed by the costs. Design and setting Age-based COVID-19 mortality data from China were applied to the population structures of Uganda and countries with previously established outbreaks, comparing theoretical mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Based on recent Ugandan data and theoretical scenarios of programme deterioration, we predicted potential additional disease burden for HIV\/AIDS, malaria and maternal mortality. Main outcome measures DALYs lost and mortality. Results Based on population age structure alone Uganda is predicted to have a relatively low COVID-19 burden compared to equivalent transmission in China and Western countries, with mortality and DALYs lost predicted to be 12% and 19% that of Italy. Scenarios of lockdown impact predict HIV\/AIDS and malaria equivalent to or higher than that of an extensive COVID-19 outbreak. Emerging HIV\/AIDS and maternal mortality data indicate that such deterioration could be occurring. Conclusions The results predict a relatively low COVID-19 impact on Uganda associated with its young population, with a high risk of negative impact on non-COVID-19 disease burden from a prolonged lockdown response. The results are likely to reflect the situation in other sub-Saharan populations, underlining the importance of tailoring COVID-19 responses to population structure and potential disease vulnerabilities.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Bell","author_inst":"Independent consultant, Issaquah, WA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristian Schultz Hansen","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Centre for Health Economics and Policy, University of Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5A, 1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kambugu","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"John Kissa","author_inst":"Uganda Ministry of Health - Division of Health Information, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Anthony K Mbonye","author_inst":"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Sreenivas A Nair","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Andrei Mosneaga","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Enos O Masini","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sahu Suvanand","author_inst":"Stop TB Partnership"},{"author_name":"Nimalan Arinaminpathy","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Muriel Lalande","author_inst":"Montpellier Hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Alain Martinot","author_inst":"Lille hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Pons","author_inst":"Avignon hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Romain","author_inst":"Trousseau hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Magdalena Ursulescu","author_inst":"Belfort hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Vie Le Sage","author_inst":"AFPA, France"},{"author_name":"Josette Raymond","author_inst":"Kremlin Bicetre hosp, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Julie Toubiana","author_inst":"Necker hosp, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
