To reduce selection bias in current burden of disease estimates derived from diagnostic testing data or serologic testing in convenience samples, we are conducting a national probability-based sample SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey. Sampling from a national address-based frame and using mailed recruitment materials and test kits will allow us to estimate national prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibodies, overall and by demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics. Data will be weighted for unequal selection probabilities and non-response and will be adjusted to population benchmarks. Due to the urgent need for these estimates, expedited interim weighting of serosurvey responses will be undertaken to produce early release estimates, which will be published on the study website, COVIDVu.org. Here, we describe a process for computing interim survey weights and guidelines for release of interim estimates.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heather Bradley","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mansour Fahimi","author_inst":"Marketing Systems Group"},{"author_name":"Travis Sanchez","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Lopman","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Martin Frankel","author_inst":"Baruch College, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Colleen Kelley","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron J Siegler","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20159749","rel_title":"Limited specificity of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISAs in serum samples of African origin","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20159749","rel_abs":"Specific serological tests are mandatory for reliable SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies but assay specificity may vary considerably between populations due to interference of immune responses to other pathogens.

A massive pro-inflammatory response on infected individuals involving several cytokines seems to play a key role on disease. As a result, therapeutic efforts have focused on anti-inflammatory strategies to ameliorate the disease, in sight of a lack of a truly effective anti-viral agent. Pentoxifylline (PTX) has been proposed by multiple authors as a potential therapeutic ally, targeting a variety of mechanisms as it has been shown to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory and hemodynamic effects. Importantly, anti-inflammatory effects center on down-regulation of cytokines such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor. In pre-pandemic studies, PTX has demonstrated to change the clinical course of inflammatory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Researchers agree it is pertinent to experimentally evaluate the effect this drug has on COVID-19 patients. The objective of this review is to summarize all the proposed mechanisms by which PTX may aid in the treatment of COVID-19, as well as prevent its deadly complications. Our interpretation of the literature is that the benefits PTX may bring to a patient with COVID-19 outweigh the risks this drug might pose on them. As a result, there is consensus regarding the evaluation of PTX in further experimental studies to better characterize its effects on COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Ramonfaur","author_inst":"School of postgraduate education, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Carlos A.

Pre-existing T cell memory has been hypothesized as a protective mechanism but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that all unexposed individuals harbor SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells with marginal cross-reactivity to common cold corona and other unrelated viruses. They display low functional avidity and broad protein target specificities and their frequencies correlate with the overall size of the CD4+ memory compartment reflecting the immunological age of an individual. COVID-19 patients have strongly increased SARS-CoV-2-specific inflammatory T cell responses that are correlated with severity. Strikingly however, patients with severe COVID-19 displayed lower TCR functional avidity and less clonal expansion. Our data suggest that a low avidity pre-existing T cell memory negatively impacts on the T cell response quality against neoantigens such as SARS-CoV-2, which may predispose to develop inappropriate immune reactions especially in the elderly. We propose the immunological age as an independent risk factor to develop severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Petra Bacher","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel & UKSH Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rosati","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniela Esser","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Rios Martini","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Carina Saggau","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel & UKSH Schleswig-Holstein, 11 Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Schiminsky","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel & UKSH Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Justina Dargvainiene","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ina Schr&oumlder","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Imke Wieters","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fabian Eberhardt","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Holger Neb","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Yascha Khodamoradi","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20186494","rel_title":"Efficacy of commercial mouth-rinses on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva: Randomized Control Trial in Singapore","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20186494","rel_abs":"The presence of high SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) titres in saliva may result in transmission of the virus and increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. This is particularly important as significant amounts of aerosols are generated during dental procedures, posing risk to dental care personnel and patients. Thus, reducing the titres of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of infected patients could be one of the key approaches to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental procedures. In this randomised control trial, the efficacy of three commercial mouth-rinse viz. povidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), in reducing the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 positive patients were compared with water. A total of 36 COVID-19 positive patients were recruited, of which 16 patients were randomly assigned to four groups: PI group (n=4), CHX group (n=6), CPC group (n=4) and water as control group (n=2). Saliva samples were collected from all patients at baseline and at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h post-application of mouth-rinses\/water. The samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis. The fold change of Ct values were significantly increased in CPC group at 5 minutes and 6 h time points (p<0.05), while it showed significant increase at 6 h timepoint for PI group (p<0.01). Considering Ct values as an indirect method of arbitrarily quantifying the viral load, it can be postulated that CPC mouth-rinse can decrease the salivary SARS-CoV-2 levels within 5 minutes of use, compared to water rinsing. The effect of decreasing salivary load with CPC and PI mouth-rinsing was observed to be sustained at 6 h time point. Within the limitation of the current study, it can be concluded that use of CPC and PI formulated commercial mouth-rinses, with its sustained effect on reducing salivary SARS-CoV-2 level, may be useful as a pre-procedural rinse to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chaminda Jayampath Seneviratne","author_inst":"National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Preethi Balan","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Karrie Ko Kwan Ki","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Nadeeka S.

It was unclear if the lockdown period was associated with differences in the case-mix of non-COVID acute medical admissions compared with the previous year. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for 1st to 30th April 2019 and 1st to 30th April 2020 from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest hospitals in the UK with over 2 million patient contacts per year. The latter time period was chosen to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases in the West Midlands. All patients admitted under acute medicine during these time periods were included. COVID-19 was confirmed by SARS-Cov-2 swab or a probable case of COVID-19 based on World Health Organization diagnostic parameters. Non-COVID patients were those with a negative SARS-Cov-2 swab and no suspicion of COVID-19. Data was sourced from the UHB in-house electronic health system (EHS). Results: The total number of acute medical admissions fell comparing April 2019 (n=2409) to April 2020 (n=1682). As a proportion of total admissions, those aged under 45 years decreased, while those aged 46 and over did not change. The number of admissions due to psychiatric conditions and overdoses was higher in April 2020 (p < 0.001). When viewed as a proportion of admissions, alcohol-related admissions (p = 0.004), psychiatric conditions and overdoses (p<0.001) increased in April 2020 than in April 2019. The proportion of patients who were in hospital due to falls also increased in April 2020 (p<0.001). In the same period, the absolute number and the proportion of admissions that were due to non-specific chest pain, to musculoskeletal complaints and patients who self-discharged prior to assessment decreased (p=0.02, p=0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). There were no significant differences in non-COVID-related intensive care admissions or mortality between the same months in the two years. Conclusion: In this large, single-centre study, there was a change in hospitalised case-mix when comparing April 2019 with April 2020: an increase in conditions which potentially reflect social isolation (falls, drug and alcohol misuse and psychiatric illness) and a decrease in conditions which rarely require in-patient hospital treatment (musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain) especially among younger adults. These results highlight two areas for further research; the impact of social isolation on health and whether younger adults could be offered alternative health services to avoid potentially unnecessary hospital assessment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bridget Riley","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Mary Packer","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzy Gallier","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Sapey","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Catherine Atkin","author_inst":"PIONEER Hub, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Ng Hui Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Indumathi Venkatachalam","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jay Lim Kheng Sit","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ling Moi Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lynette Oon","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Bee Tin Goh","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Jean Sim Xiang Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194811","rel_title":"Disease control as an optimization problem","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194811","rel_abs":"Traditionally, expert epidemiologists devise policies for disease control through a mixture of intuition and brute force.

This scheme is not scalable, in the sense that, when used to optimize over policies which depend on many parameters, it would likely fail to output an optimal disease policy in time for its implementation. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al. (March, 2020).

Results 462 (48%) questions were classified as positive, while 391 (41%) were negative. Number of views were higher for negative questions (11421 vs 7300, p=0.004). Majority of the questions were on social impact (N=217, 23%), followed by politics (N=122, 13%) and disease management (N=96, 10%). Positive questions had more accurate, but less popular answers (p<0.05). Information related to 229 (28%) questions were present on WHO website, while partial information was present for 103 (11%) questions. Discussion Higher views with negative questions suggest that false and panic promoting information is more likely to get public attention. A substantial amount of questions was related to the present and future effects of COVID-19 on social and personal lives of the users which were not readily available on official health websites.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaiben George","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepak Gautham","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vartika Kesarwani","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"PonAravindhan A Sugumar","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Malhotra","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Ng Hui Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Indumathi Venkatachalam","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jay Lim Kheng Sit","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ling Moi Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lynette Oon","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Bee Tin Goh","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Jean Sim Xiang Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20195081","rel_title":"An Application of Logistic Formula to Deaths by COVID-19 in Japan","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20195081","rel_abs":"A logistic formula in biology is applied to analyze deaths by COVID-19 for both of the first and the second waves in Japan.

Considering constraints on production and shipping, most existing strategies seek to maximize the outflow of therapeutics, hence optimizing for rapid dissemination. Surprisingly, we find that this intuitive approach is counterproductive. The reason is that focusing strictly on the quantity of disseminated therapeutics, such strategies disregard their specific spreading patterns, most crucially, they overlook the interplay of these spreading patterns with those of the pathogens. This results in a discrepancy between supply and demand, that prohibits efficient mitigation even under optimal conditions of superfluous drug\/vaccine flow. Therefore, here, we design a dissemination strategy that naturally follows the predicted spreading patterns of the epidemic, optimizing not just for supply volume, but also for its congruency with the anticipated demand. Specifically, we show that epidemics spread relatively uniformly across all destinations, and hence we introduce an equality constraint into our dissemination that prioritizes supply homogeneity. This strategy may, at times, slow down the supply rate in certain locations, however, thanks to its egalitarian nature, which mimics the flow of the viral spread, it provides a dramatic leap in overall mitigation efficiency, saving more lives with orders of magnitude less resources.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adar Hacohen","author_inst":"Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel \/ Augmanity , Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Reuven Cohen","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"},{"author_name":"Sol Efroni","author_inst":"Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ido Bachelet","author_inst":"Augmanity, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Baruch Barzel","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel\/The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Ng Hui Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Indumathi Venkatachalam","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jay Lim Kheng Sit","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ling Moi Lin","author_inst":"Department of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lynette Oon","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Bee Tin Goh","author_inst":"Singapore Oral Microbiomics Initiative, National Dental Research Institute Singapore (NDRIS), National Dental Centre Singapore, Oral Health ACP, Duke NUS Medica"},{"author_name":"Jean Sim Xiang Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Michael Sonntagbauer","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."},{"author_name":"Maria JGT Vehreschild","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt & Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claudio Conrad","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Preetz, Preetz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194985","rel_title":"Longitudinal analysis of the utility of liver biochemistry in hospitalised COVID-19 patients as prognostic markers","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194985","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has been associated with deranged liver biochemistry in studies from China, Italy and the USA. However, the clinical utility of liver biochemistry as a prognostic marker of outcome for COVID-19 is currently debated. Methods: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing comorbidities. Liver biochemistry was compared between groups over time to determine whether derangement was associated with outcome. Results: 26.8% (157\/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139\/1165) in the non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged [&ge;]75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with pre-existing liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline phosphatase increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004) over time in patients who died. We did not find a significant association between other liver biochemistry and death. Conclusion: In this UK population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with COVID-19 but only baseline low albumin and a rising alkaline phosphatase over time are prognostic markers for death.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingyan Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David A Smith","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Cori Campbell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Steve Harris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hizni Salih","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kinga A Varnai","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kerrie Woods","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theresa Noble","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Oliver Freeman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Zuzana Moysova","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marjot","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gwilym J Webb","author_inst":"Addenbrooke's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jim Davies","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Barnes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Florian Tran","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194258","rel_title":"COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194258","rel_abs":"Background: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manon Ragonnet-Cronin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Olivia Boyd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F Nascimento","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Elita Jauneikaite","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl A Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London; University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194589","rel_title":"Improved estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers at low case incidence and between epidemic waves","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194589","rel_abs":"We construct a recursive Bayesian smoother, termed EpiFilter, for estimating the effective reproduction number, R, from the incidence of an infectious disease in real time and retrospectively. Our approach borrows from Kalman filtering theory, is quick and easy to compute, generalisable, deterministic and unlike many current methods, requires no change-point or window size assumptions. We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. This combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions, makes EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where existing methods can struggle. As a result, we find EpiFilter to be particularly suited for assessing the risk of second waves of infection, in real time.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kris Varun Parag","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Olivia Boyd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F Nascimento","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Elita Jauneikaite","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl A Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London; University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Rosenstiel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Robert Markewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Klaus-Peter Wandinger","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jan Rybniker","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194308","rel_title":"Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and risk of future sickness","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194308","rel_abs":"Background: The extent that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may protect against future virus-associated disease is unknown.

To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. The limit of detection (LoD) is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, and a reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for LoD studies. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA carrying specific genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure including nucleic acid extraction and to accommodate customized primer-probe sets targeting different genome sequences. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (460000 {+\/-}65000 GEQ\/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhou","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Donglai Liu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Liang Ma","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Devices, Bioland Laboratory (Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory)"},{"author_name":"Tingting Ma","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Tingying Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liang Li","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sihong Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Eni Andersson","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"August Jernbom Falk","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Sofia Bergstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Emilie Hultin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pin","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Anna M\u00e5nberg","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Johan Mattsson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laila Sara Arroyo M\u00fchr","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kalle Conneryd Lundgren","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20195339","rel_title":"Association among income loss, financial strain and depressive symptoms during COVID-19: evidence from two longitudinal studies","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20195339","rel_abs":"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and the economy, with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course. Methods. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. Findings. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). Interpretation. Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID-19 has negative implications for mental health. Funding. This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation, Foundation Dora and Kirsh Foundation.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nimrod Hertz-Palmor","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tyler M Moore","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Doron Gothelf","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Grace E DiDomenico","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Idit Dekel","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David M Greenberg","author_inst":"Bar Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Lily A Brown","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Noam Matalon","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elina Visoki","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Lauren K White","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Megan H Himes","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Maya Lifshitz-Schwartz","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raz Gross","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ruben C Gur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Raquel E Gur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Itai M Pessach","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Barzilay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Johan Mattsson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laila Sara Arroyo M\u00fchr","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kalle Conneryd Lundgren","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194951","rel_title":"COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the Metropolitan Region, Chile: time, space, and structural factors","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194951","rel_abs":"Chile has been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Slum-dwellers' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 are currently poorly understood. To investigate the KAP towards COVID-19 among slum dwellers resided in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional offline survey was carried out enrolling 406 slum dwellers (53.2% male; mean age=44.9 years [SD=12.1]; age range=18-85 years) between August and September, 2020. The face to face interview was conducted to collect data from 6 selected slum areas in Dhaka City using convenience sampling. The questionnaire consisted of informed consent along with questions concerning observational checklists, socio-demographics, and KAP. Results: A sizeable minority were observed without wearing face masks during the survey periods (18.2%) and a vast portion (97.5%) without any hand protection. The mean scores of KAP were 6.1plus-or-minus sign2.6 (out of 17), 12.3plus-or-minus sign1.7 (out of 14), and 9.8plus-or-minus sign1.6 (out of 12), respectively. Moreover, the KAP were strongly and positively correlated with each other. Conclusions: The findings revealed that the majority of slum dwellers in Bangladesh have limited knowledge of COVID-19. Poor practices (i.e., face mask and hand protection) were directly observed during the survey. The findings suggest the immediate implementation of health education programs and adequate interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

This trend is puzzling because New Zealand confronted distressing health and economic uncertainties resembling those in other countries. Additionally, New Zealand's March\/April 2020 COVID-19 lockdown was among the world's most stringent, requiring strict social isolation with domestic cohabitants for an unspecified period of time and with unknown effectiveness. Here, we use Bayesian multilevel mediation models to systematically test previously theorised mechanisms of health, economic, political, and social concern on pandemic distress in a nationally diverse panel sample during the first 18 days of New Zealand's lockdown against within-participant baselines from the previous year (N = 940). We observe that health concerns were not markedly elevated and that the maintenance of health satisfaction buffered people from greater distress. There was more variation in economic concern; however, sustained satisfaction with standards of living and future security prevented greater distress. Although satisfaction with the government and institutional trust rose precipitously, these gains did not diminish distress. However, distress mitigation occurred from a greater sense of neighbourhood community. Surprisingly, reduced fatigue, a byproduct of the stringent lockdown, proved to be an even more powerful distress buffer; the magnitude of this buffering suggests that fatigue reduction is an important horizon for public mental health research. Finally, most of the distress that New Zealanders experienced can be explained by challenges to personal relationship satisfaction. Overall, these results clarify how mental health was sustained and challenged during a stringent pandemic lockdown across a demographically diverse population, with insights for the present and future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph A Bulbulia","author_inst":"Victoria University of Wellington"},{"author_name":"Sofia D Piven","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Fiona Kate Barlow","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Don E.

Whether the pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains unknown. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months in 2015-2019. Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th percentile of temperature at 3 {degrees}C) in comparison with the minimum mortality temperature (24 {degrees}C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus 1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)], and [&ge;] 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)]. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the risk of cold temperature on mortality in Italy, particularly among the elderly people. Further studies are warranted to understand the exact mechanism when detailed data are available.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenhua Yu","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Rongbin Xu","author_inst":"Monash Unviersity"},{"author_name":"Tingting Ye","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Chunlei Han","author_inst":"Binzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Li","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Yuming Guo","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Carla A Houkamau","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Taciano L Milfont","author_inst":"University of Waikato"},{"author_name":"Danny Osborne","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"John H Shaver","author_inst":"University of Otago"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Troughton","author_inst":"Victoria University of Wellington"},{"author_name":"Marc Wilson","author_inst":"Victoria University of Wellington"},{"author_name":"Kumar Yogeeswaran","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Chris G Sibley","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Raquel E Gur","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Itai M Pessach","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Barzilay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Johan Mattsson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laila Sara Arroyo M\u00fchr","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kalle Conneryd Lundgren","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kochanek","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20191957","rel_title":"Adherence to the test, trace and isolate system: results from a time series of 21 nationally representative surveys in the UK (the COVID-19 Rapid Survey of Adherence to Interventions and Responses  study)","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20191957","rel_abs":"Objectives: To investigate rates of adherence to the UKs test, trace and isolate system over time. Design: Time series of cross-sectional online surveys. Setting: Data were collected between 2 March and 5 August 2020. Participants: 42,127 responses from 31,787 people living in the UK, aged 16 years or over, are presented (21 survey waves, n{approx}2,000 per wave). Main outcome measures: Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high temperature \/ fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste), self-reported adherence to self-isolation if symptomatic, requesting an antigen test if symptomatic, intention to share details of close contacts, self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Results: Only 48.9% of participants (95% CI 48.2% to 49.7%) identified key symptoms of COVID-19. Self-reported adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours was low (self-isolation 18.2%, 95% CI 16.4% to 19.9%; requesting an antigen test 11.9%, 95% CI 10.1% to 13.8%; intention to share details of close contacts 76.1%, 95% CI 75.4% to 76.8%; quarantining 10.9%, 95% CI 7.8% to 13.9%) and largely stable over time. By contrast, intention to adhere to protective measures was much higher. Non-adherence was associated with: men, younger age groups, having a dependent child in the household, lower socio-economic grade, greater hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector. Conclusions: Practical support and financial reimbursement is likely to improve adherence. Targeting messaging and policies to men, younger age groups, and key workers may also be necessary.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by a fully remote online telemedicine service increased following the emergence of COVID-19. Design: We used regression discontinuity to compare the number of requests to online telemedicine service Women on Web in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the number deaths due to COVID-19, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions, and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests. Setting: Eight European countries served by Women on Web. Participants: 3,915 people who made requests for self-managed abortion to Women on Web between January 1st, 2019 and June 1st, 2020. Main Outcome Measures: Percent change in requests to Women on Web before and after the emergence of COVID-19 and associated lockdown measures. Results: Five countries showed significant increases in requests, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (p<0.001). Countries with significant increases in requests were either countries where abortion services are mainly provided in hospitals or where no abortion services are available and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain authorized teleconsultation for medication abortion and provision of medications by mail during the pandemic. Conclusion: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during COVID-19 demonstrate demand for fully remote models of abortion care and an urgent need for policymakers to expand access to medication abortion by telemedicine.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abigail R.A.

However, the current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to reveal important data for understanding its behavior in pregnant women. Methods: We analyzed the records of 326,586 non-pregnant women of reproductive age and 7,444 pregnant women with no other risk factor who also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result to estimate adjusted prevalence (aP) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of COVID-19 and its requirement of hospitalization, intubation, ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Adjustment was done through Poisson regressions for age and altitude of residence and birth. Generalized binomial models were used to generate probability plots to display how each outcome varied across ages and altitudes. Results: Pregnancy was independently associated with a 15% higher probability of COVID-19 (aPR: 1.15), a 116% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.169) and a 127% higher probability of ICU admission (aPR: 2.275). Also, pregnancy was associated with 84.2% higher probability of developing pneumonia (aPR: 1.842) and a 163% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.639). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates between pregnant and non pregnant women (1.178, 95% CI: 0.68-1.67). Conclusion: Pregnancy was associated with a higher probability of COVID-19, developing of pneumonia, hospitalization, and ICU admission. Our results also suggest that the risk of COVID-19 and its related outcomes, except for intubation, decrease with altitude.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus displays unique features including widely varying symptoms and outcomes between infected individuals. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into virus transmission dynamics, pre-existing cross-reactive immunity, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This BU ELISA method exhibits very low signal from plasma or serum samples added to uncoated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) reactive antibodies from blood samples drawn prior to May 2019. Of our pre-pandemic cohort, no SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive IgG antibodies were detected in subjects over 70 years of age, and SARS-CoV-2 NP-reactive antibodies were present at similar levels to infected subjects in some individuals and very low in others. Also, samples drawn in May 2020 from two individuals with no symptoms or no known virus exposure contained SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies at intermediate amounts compared with other subject groups (higher than pre-pandemic and lower than confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected). The one asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 convalescent subject in our study possessed comparable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgM and IgG but drastically lower IgA than the symptomatic counterparts. Also, our assay detected positive signal from samples that gave negative results in a commercially available Lateral Flow Device (LFD) and the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Yuen","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dylan Steiner","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Riley Pihl","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Chavez","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Olson","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lillia Baird","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Filiz Korkmaz","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricia Urick","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Manish Sagar","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jacob Berrigan","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rahm Gummuluru","author_inst":"Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ronald Corley","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anna Belkina","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Mostoslavsky","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian Rifkin","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amedeo Cappione","author_inst":"MilliporeSigma"},{"author_name":"Nina Lin","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nahid Bhadelia","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Snyder-Cappione","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Frank Leypoldt","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology, Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver A Cornely","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, 50937 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Scheffold","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20187369","rel_title":"Longitudinal multi-omics analysis identifies responses of megakaryocytes, erythroid cells and plasmablasts as hallmarks of severe COVID-19 trajectories","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20187369","rel_abs":"The pandemic spread of the potentially life-threatening disease COVID-19 requires a thorough understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of host responses. Temporal resolution of cellular features associated with a severe disease trajectory will be a pre-requisite for finding disease outcome predictors. Here, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics study using a two-centre German cohort of 13 patients (from Cologne and Kiel, cohort 1). We analysed the bulk transcriptome, bulk DNA methylome, and single-cell transcriptome (>358,000 cells, including BCR profiles) of peripheral blood samples harvested from up to 5 time points. The results from single-cell and bulk transcriptome analyses were validated in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients from Bonn (18 patients, cohort 2) and Nijmegen (40 patients, cohort 3), respectively. We observed an increase of proliferating, activated plasmablasts in severe COVID-19, and show a distinct expression pattern related to a hyperactive cellular metabolism of these cells. We further identified a notable expansion of type I IFN-activated circulating megakaryocytes and their progenitors, indicative of emergency megakaryopoiesis, which was confirmed in cohort 2. These changes were accompanied by increased erythropoiesis in the critical phase of the disease with features of hypoxic signalling. Finally, projecting megakaryocyte- and erythroid cell-derived co-expression modules to longitudinal blood transcriptome samples from cohort 3 confirmed an association of early temporal changes of these features with fatal COVID-19 disease outcome. In sum, our longitudinal multi-omics study demonstrates distinct cellular and gene expression dynamics upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, which point to metabolic shifts of circulating immune cells, and reveals changes in megakaryocytes and increased erythropoiesis as important outcome indicators in severe COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":72,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joana P.

D-dimer levels have been shown to positively correlate with disease severity and mortality, leading to adoption of new empiric anticoagulation protocols by many centers. We aimed to assess whether COVID-19 further increased the risk of TE events in a cancer population who tested positive for COVID-19 at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. The electronic medical records of 218 cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed up to April 10th, 2020. Work-up of thrombosis was done by the primary team upon clinical or laboratory suspicion. All imaging studies' reports, within 20 days of COVID-19 positive test, were reviewed for presence of new arterial or venous thrombosis. Mortality was assessed up to one month since positive COVID-19 test result. Twelve patients (5.5%) were found to have new arterial (N=6, 50%) or venous (N=6, 50%) thrombosis. Five patients (41.7%) had history of prior TE events. Incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Arterial events occurred in the brain (66.7%), aorta (16.7%) and coronary arteries (16.7%). Median time from COVID test was 8 days (IQR, 1.5 - 11.3). Five patients (41.7%) had received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation for a median 2 days (IQR, 1 - 5). Median peak D-dimer within 36 hours of the TE event was 9.8 mcg\/mL (N=4 patients, IQR, 1.7 - 18.3). Mortality did not differ significantly between the patients with new TE events vs those without; mortality 41.7% vs 37.4%, respectively, p=0.77. Empiric anticoagulation did not improve mortality. Fifty percent of all TE events were arterial. The overall TE rate of 5.5% in the cancer population was not higher than the risk of general population. Our findings support the need for larger studies in the COVID-19+ cancer population.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phaedon D Zavras","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Jacobi Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Rafi Kabarriti","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Vikas Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Goel","author_inst":"Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Henny H.

Despite expected universal susceptibility to a novel pathogen, the pandemic to date has been characterized by higher observed incidence in the oldest individuals and lower incidence in children and adolescents. Differential testing by age group may explain some of these observed differences, but datasets linking case counts to public health testing volumes are uncommon. Methods: We used data from Ontario, Canada. Case data were obtained from Ontarios provincial line, while testing data were obtained from an information system with complete SARS-CoV-2 testing data for public, hospital, and private laboratories. Demographic and temporal patterns in reported case incidence, testing rates, and test positivity were explored using negative binomial regression models. Standardized morbidity and testing ratios (SMR, STR), and standardized test positivity (STP) were calculated by dividing age- and sex-specific rates by overall rates; demographic and temporal patterns in standardized ratios were explored using meta-regression. Testing adjusted SMR were estimated using linear regression models. Results: Observed disease incidence and testing rates were highest in oldest individuals and markedly lower in those aged < 20. Temporal trends in disease incidence and testing were observed, but standardizing morbidity and testing ratios eliminated temporal trends (i.e., relative patterns by age and sex remained identical regardless of epidemic phase). After adjustment for testing frequency, SMR were lowest in children and adults aged 70 and older, approximately the same in adolescents as in the population as a whole and elevated in young adults (aged 20-29 years), providing a markedly different picture of the epidemic than seen with crude SMR or case-based incidence. Test-adjusted SMR were validated using seroprevalence data (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.82, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically performed using only test-positive case data, without adjustment for testing frequency. Older adults are tested more frequently, likely due to increased disease severity, while children are under-tested. Adjustment for testing frequency results in a very different picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by age, one that is consistent with estimates obtained through serological testing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Michael Hillmer","author_inst":"Ontario Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Sheila O'Brien","author_inst":"Canadian Blood Services"},{"author_name":"Steven J.

Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that the pandemic is characterized by superspreading, where a small fraction account for the majority of infections. Capturing this phenomenon theoretically requires modeling at the scale of individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that superspreading represents an Achilles' heel of COVID-19, and drastically improves the efficacy of mitigations which reduce the personal contact number, even when this is done without changing the average social contact time.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bjarke Frost Nielsen","author_inst":"Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Kim Sneppen","author_inst":"Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Michael Hillmer","author_inst":"Ontario Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Sheila O'Brien","author_inst":"Canadian Blood Services"},{"author_name":"Steven J.

This study investigates the interaction between influenza and COVID-19 during the latter part of the 2019-20 influenza season in England. Methods: Individuals tested for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were extracted from national surveillance systems between 20\/01\/2020 and 25\/04\/2020. To estimate influenza infection on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of SARS-CoV-2 in those who tested positive for influenza compared to those who tested negative for influenza. To assess whether a coinfection was associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 outcome, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of death adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity and coinfection status. Findings: The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 68% lower among influenza positive cases, suggesting possible pathogenic competition between the two viruses. Patients with a coinfection had a risk of death of 5.92 (95% CI, 3.21-10.91) times greater than among those with neither influenza nor SARS-CoV-2 suggesting possible synergistic effects in coinfected individuals. The odds of ventilator use or death and ICU admission or death was greatest among coinfection patients showing strong evidence of an interaction effect compared to SARS-CoV-2\/influenza acting independently. Interpretation: Cocirculation of these viruses could have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality and health service demand. Testing for influenza alongside SARS-CoV-2 and maximising influenza vaccine uptake should be prioritised to mitigate these risks.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Stowe","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elise Tessier","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Hongxin Zhao","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Guy","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Berit Muller-Pebody","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nick Andrews","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Josephs-Spaulding","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Medicine, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"Department I of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cologne and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; German Center for Infection Res"},{"author_name":"Axel Kuenstner","author_inst":"Luebeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany."},{"author_name":"Elisa Rosati","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna C.
