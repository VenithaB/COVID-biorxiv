Asymptomatic and pre symptomatic are responsible for substantial transmission. RNA or antigen tests are necessary to identify non-symptomatic individuals. We tested the feasibility of using samples pooling offering different collection alternatives (swab\/throat wash\/saliva) to volunteers of a public health institute. Methods: We evaluated pool samples from both reconstituted (frozen material from tested samples) and a prospective collection of asymptomatic volunteers. Some collections were paired for comparison. Pooled and some individual samples were extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and\/or Lucigen Quick Extract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch, USA) and submitted to rtCCR using (Allplex, Seegene, Korea). Results: A total of 240 samples from 130 new collections and 37 samples with known result were evaluated. Pool CT was generally higher than individual samples. Lucigen extraction showed higher CT, including false negative results for samples with high CT at Qiagen extraction. Paired Swab and TW samples showed comparable results. No volunteer from negative pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after collection. Conclusions: Clinical samples pooling to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is feasible and an economical way to test for COVID-19, especially in surveillance strategies targeting more infectiousness, higher viremia individuals. The use of Lucigen reagents show lower sensibility that may lead to false negative results with lower viremia samples. Combining throat wash with saliva may provide and interesting alternative for auto collection, but more comparative work is needed.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giselle Ibette Silva Lopez Lopes","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Rita de Cassia Compagnoli Carmona","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institution"},{"author_name":"Valeria Oliveira Silva","author_inst":"Pos Graduacao da Coordenadoria de Controle de Doencas do Estado de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cintia Mayumi Ahagon","author_inst":"Pos Graduacao da Coordenadoria de Controle de Doencas do Estado de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lincoln Spinazola do Prado","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Cristina Pereira dos Santos","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bernardes Borges da Silva","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Wiliam Nery Ribeiro","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institue"},{"author_name":"Elaine Monteiro Matshuda","author_inst":"Pos Graduacao da Coordenadoria de Controle de Doencas do Estado de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Auldrey Cilli","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Sardinha Afonso","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Margarete Aparecida Benaga Pinho","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Maria do Carmo Sampaio Tavare Timnetsky","author_inst":"Adolfo Lutz Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.05.20206664","rel_title":"Antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in adults from the Vancouver metropolitan area, Canada","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.05.20206664","rel_abs":"Background: Quantifying antibody reactivity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the population level may help understand individual differences in COVID-19 severity. Pre-existing low antibody cross-reactivity may be particularly prevalent among childcare providers, including pediatric health care workers (HCW) who may be more exposed to circulating coronaviruses. Methods: Cross-sectional study that included adults in the Vancouver area in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between May 17 and June 19, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was ascertained by measuring total SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/M\/A antibodies against a recombinant spike (S1) protein, and adjusted for bias due to false-positive and false-negative test results. A novel, high sensitivity multiplex assay was also used to profile IgGs against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV and four circulating coronaviruses. Findings: Among 276 participants (71% HCW), three showed evidence of direct viral exposure, yielding an adjusted seroprevalence of 0.60% [95%CI 0% - 2.71%], with no difference between HCW and non-HCW, or between paediatric and adult HCW. Among the remaining 273 unexposed individuals, 7.3% [95%CI 4.5% - 11.1%], 48.7 [95%CI 42.7% - 54.8%] and 82.4% [95%CI 77.4% - 86.7%] showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, N or Spike proteins, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 reactivity did not correlate with age, sex, did not differ between HCW and non-HCW (prevalence: 1.0% vs 1.0%; P=1.00) and between pediatric and adult HCW (prevalence: 0.7% vs 1.6%; P=0.54), and weakly correlated with reactivity to circulating coronaviruses (Spearman rho range: 0.130 to 0.224 for 7 significant out of 16 correlations; false-discovery rate-adjusted for a total of 36 correlations). Interpretation: A substantial proportion of individuals showed low, but detectable antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens in this population despite a low evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdelilah Majdoubi","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sarah E O'Connell","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Christina Michalski","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sarah Dada","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Narpala","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Jean Gelinas","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Surrey Memorial Hospital, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Disha Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Surrey Memorial Hospital, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada  Department of Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Therapeut"},{"author_name":"Claire Cheung","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"},{"author_name":"Manjula Basappa","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Matthias Gorges","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Department of Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B"},{"author_name":"Vilte E Barakauskas","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"David M Goldfarb","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Medical Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"Daniel C Douek","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Adrian B McDermott","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Pascal M Lavoie","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.06.20207878","rel_title":"The potential impact of intervention strategies on COVID-19 transmission in Malawi: A mathematical modelling study","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.06.20207878","rel_abs":"Background COVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings such as Malawi due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we estimate the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity. Methods The infection fatality ratios (IFR) in Malawi were estimated by adjusting reported IFR for China accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions. The impact of a novel therapeutic agent and increases in hospital capacity and oxygen availability were explored, given different assumptions on mortality rates. Findings The estimated age-specific IFR in Malawi are higher than those reported for China, however the younger average age of the population results in a slightly lower population-weighted IFR (0.48%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.30% - 0.72% compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% - 1.3% in China). The current interventions implemented, (i.e. social distancing, workplace closures and public transport restrictions) could potentially avert 3,100 deaths (95% UI 1,500 - 4,500) over the course of the epidemic. Enhanced shielding of people aged [&ge;] 60 years could avert a further 30,500 deaths (95% UI 17,500 - 45,600) and halve ICU admissions at the peak of the outbreak. Coverage of face coverings of 60% under the assumption of 50% efficacy could be sufficient to control the epidemic. A novel therapeutic agent, which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity could reduce projected mortality to 2.55 deaths per 1,000 population (95% UI 1.58 - 3.84). Conclusion The risks due to COVID-19 vary across settings and are influenced by age, underlying health and health system capacity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tara Danielle Mangal","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charlie Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Dominic Nkhoma","author_inst":"University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"Watson J Oliver","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Revill","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Timothy Colbourn","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Phillips","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Timothy B Hallett","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joseph Mfutso-Bengo","author_inst":"University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"David M Goldfarb","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Medical Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"Daniel C Douek","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Adrian B McDermott","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Pascal M Lavoie","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.05.20205955","rel_title":"Economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.05.20205955","rel_abs":"The US population faces stressors associated with suicide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation may inform policies and programs to prevent suicide. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from two, nationally representative surveys of US adults: The 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (conducted March 31 to April 13). We compared suicidal ideation in 2017-2018 to suicidal ideation in 2020. We estimated the association between stressors - job loss, trouble paying rent, and social isolation - and suicidal ideation in 2020 using bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance. Suicidal ideation increased more than fourfold, from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), while losing a job was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Feeling alone was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.4). We conclude that suicidal ideation increased more than fourfold during the COVID-19 pandemic. Difficulty paying rent and loneliness were most associated with suicidal ideation. Policies and programs to support people experiencing economic precarity and loneliness may contribute to suicide prevention.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Raifman","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Ettman","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Lorraine Dean","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins"},{"author_name":"Colleen Barry","author_inst":"JohnsHopkins"},{"author_name":"Sandro Galea","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Revill","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Timothy Colbourn","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Phillips","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Timothy B Hallett","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joseph Mfutso-Bengo","author_inst":"University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"David M Goldfarb","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Medical Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"Daniel C Douek","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Adrian B McDermott","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Unite"},{"author_name":"Pascal M Lavoie","author_inst":"BC Children Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.06.20207894","rel_title":"Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and social distancing: A cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.06.20207894","rel_abs":"Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, a controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic within the period of June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = 0.017) with individuals' perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = 0.032) and education level (P < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted 'knowledge about social distancing'. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < 0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the 'perception of COVID-19 origin' and the 'perception and knowledge about social distancing'.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lenisse M.

Recent technological advances have made it possible to sequence genomes rapidly enough to inform outbreak response, and cheaply enough to justify dense sampling of even large epidemics. With increased availability of sequencing it is possible for agile networks of sequencing facilities to collaborate on the sequencing and analysis of epidemic genomic data.\n\nIn response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium was formed with the aim of rapidly sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes as part of a national-scale genomic surveillance strategy. The network consists of universities, academic institutes, regional sequencing centres and the four UK Public Health Agencies.\n\nWe describe the development and deployment of Majora, an encompassing digital infrastructure to address the challenge of collecting and integrating both genomic sequencing data and sample-associated metadata produced across the COG-UK network. The system was designed and implemented pragmatically to stand up capacity rapidly in a pandemic caused by a novel virus. This approach has underpinned the success of COG-UK, which has rapidly become the leading contributor of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to international databases and has generated over 60,000 sequences to date.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel M Nicholls","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Radoslaw Poplawski","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Bull","author_inst":"Pathogen Genomics Unit, Public Health Wales NHS Trust, Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Anthony Underwood","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Michael Chapman","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Cambridge, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Khalil Abu-Dahab","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Ben Taylor","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sara Rey","author_inst":"Pathogen Genomics Unit, Public Health Wales NHS Trust, Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Roberto Amato","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Rich Livett","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Sonia Goncalves","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Ewan M Harrison","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Sharon J Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge, Department of Medicine, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David M Aanensen","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Connor","author_inst":"Pathogen Genomics Unit, Public Health Wales NHS Trust, Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Loman","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham"},{"author_name":"- The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK)","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.07.325910","rel_title":"Production of ORF8 protein from SARS-CoV-2 using an inducible virus-mediated expression-system in suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.07.325910","rel_abs":"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spread worldwide in 2019, is an urgent problem to be overcome.

As one of the ways to advance the functional analysis of ORF8, mass production of ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure is necessary. In this study, we attempted to produce ORF8 protein by chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells. An ORF8-producing line was generated by the Agrobacterium method. As a result, the production of ORF8 of 8.8 {+\/-} 1.4 mg\/L of culture medium was confirmed. SDS-PAGE and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis confirmed that the ORF8 produced by this system is a dimeric form with a three-dimensional structure, unlike that produced in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was suggested that the ORF8 produced by this system was N-glycosylated. Through this study, we succeeded in producing ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure in a chemical-inducible protein production system using tobacco BY2 cells. It is expected that the functional analysis of ORF8 will be advanced using the ORF8 produced by this system and that it will greatly contribute to the development of vaccines and antibodies against ORF8.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomohiro Imamura","author_inst":"Ishikawa Prefectural University"},{"author_name":"Noriyoshi Isozumi","author_inst":"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)"},{"author_name":"Yasuki Higashimura","author_inst":"Ishikawa Prefectural University"},{"author_name":"Shinya Ohki","author_inst":"Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)"},{"author_name":"Masashi Mori","author_inst":"Ishikawa Prefectural University"},{"author_name":"Khalil Abu-Dahab","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Ben Taylor","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sara Rey","author_inst":"Pathogen Genomics Unit, Public Health Wales NHS Trust, Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Roberto Amato","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Rich Livett","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Sonia Goncalves","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Ewan M Harrison","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Sharon J Peacock","author_inst":"University of Cambridge, Department of Medicine, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David M Aanensen","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Connor","author_inst":"Pathogen Genomics Unit, Public Health Wales NHS Trust, Cardiff"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Loman","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham"},{"author_name":"- The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK)","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"plant biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.07.328302","rel_title":"Extremely potent human monoclonal antibodies from convalescent Covid-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.07.328302","rel_abs":"Human monoclonal antibodies are safe, preventive and therapeutic tools, that can be rapidly developed to help restore the massive health and economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

In this study, we investigated the diversity of the virus in the context of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. Full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of the circulating viruses from all over India were collected from GISAID, an open data repository, until 25thJuly, 2020. We have focused on the non-synonymous changes across the genome that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Analysis of the genomic signatures of the non-synonymous mutations demonstrated a strong association between the time of sample collection and the accumulation of genetic diversity. Most of these isolates from India belonged to the A2a clade (63.4%) which has overcome the selective pressure and is spreading rapidly across several continents. Interestingly a new clade I\/A3i has emerged as the second-highest prevalent type among the Indian isolates, comprising 25.5% of the Indian sequences. Emergence of new mutations in the S protein was observed. Major SARS-CoV-2 clades in India have defining mutations in the RdRp. Maximum accumulation of mutations was observed in ORF1a.\n\nOther than the clade-defining mutations, few representative non-synonymous mutations were checked against the available crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the DynaMut server to assess their thermodynamic stability. We have observed that SARS-CoV-2 genomes contain more uracil than any other nucleotide. Furthermore, substitution of nucleotides to uracil was highest among the non-synonymous mutations observed. The A+U content in SARS-CoV-2 genome is much higher compared to other RNA viruses, suggesting that the virus RdRp has a propensity towards uracil incorporation in the genome. This implies that thymidine analogues may have a better chance to competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication than other nucleotide analogues.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Subrata Roy","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Himadri Nath","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Abinash Mallick","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Subhajit Biswas","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Noemi Manganaro","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Giulia Piccini","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Manenti","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pantano","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anna Kabanova","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences; Tumour Immunology Unit, Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Troisi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences; Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Siena, Ita"},{"author_name":"Fabiola Vacca","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences; Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Siena, Ita"},{"author_name":"Dario Cardamone","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences; University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta De Santi","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Linda Benincasa","author_inst":"VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Capobianchi","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Concetta Castilletti","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arianna Emiliozzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Medical Sciences, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, University Hosp"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Fabbiani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Sciences, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Montagnani","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; Department of Medical Sciences, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, University Hosp"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Depau","author_inst":"MedBiotech Hub and Competence Center, Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Jlenia Brunetti","author_inst":"MedBiotech Hub and Competence Center, Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Luisa Bracci","author_inst":"12MedBiotech Hub and Competence Center, Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Montomoli","author_inst":"VisMederi S.r.l, Siena, Italy; VisMederi Research S.r.l., Siena, Italy; Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Sala","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rino Rappuoli","author_inst":"Monoclonal Antibody Discovery (MAD) Lab - Fondazione Toscana Life Sciences; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.07.307546","rel_title":"Making the invisible enemy visible","rel_date":"2020-10-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.07.307546","rel_abs":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, structural biologists have rushed to solve the structures of the 28 proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome in order to understand the viral life cycle and enable structure-based drug design.

Though the substrate targets of the viral nucleotidyl transferase are unknown, NiRAN active sites are highly conserved and essential for viral replication 3. We show, for the first time, the detection and sequence location of GMP-modified amino acids in nidovirus RdRP-associated proteins using heavy isotope-assisted MS and MS\/MS peptide sequencing. We identified lys-143 in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein, nsp7, as a primary site of nucleotidylation in vitro that uses a phosphoramide bond to covalently attach with GMP. In SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins, we demonstrate a unique O-linked GMP attachment on nsp7 ser-1, whose formation required the presence of nsp12. It is clear that additional nucleotidylation sites remain undiscovered, which includes the possibility that nsp12 itself may form a transient GMP adduct in the NiRAN active site that has eluted detection in these initial studies due to instability of the covalent attachment. Our results demonstrate new strategies for detecting GMP-peptide linkages that can be adapted for higher throughput screening using mass spectrometric technologies. These data are expected to be important for a rapid and timely characterization of a new enzymatic activity in SARS-CoV-2 that may be an attractive drug target aimed at limiting viral replication in infected patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael R Sussman","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Brian J Conti","author_inst":"Univesity of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Robert N Kirchdoerfer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Cameron Fyfe","author_inst":"Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Yunyun Gao","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sam Horrell","author_inst":"Diamond Lightsource, UK"},{"author_name":"Agnel Praveen Joseph","author_inst":"Science and Technology Facilities Council, UK"},{"author_name":"Luise Kandler","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Kippes","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ferdinand Kirsten","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Konstantin M\u00fcller","author_inst":"RVZ, University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kristopher Nolte","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Payne","author_inst":"Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew G.

In viruses, the existence of disordered proteome is also proven and are related with its conformational dynamics inside the host. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a large proteome, in which, structure and functions of many proteins are not known as of yet. Previously, we have investigated the dark proteome of SARS-CoV-2. However, the disorder status of non-structural protein 11 (nsp11) was not possible because of very small in size, just 13 amino acid long, and for most of the IDP predictors, the protein size should be at least 30 amino acid long. Also, the structural dynamics and function status of nsp11 was not known. Hence, we have performed extensive experimentation on nsp11. Our results, based on the Circular dichroism spectroscopy gives characteristic disordered spectrum for IDPs. Further, we investigated the conformational behaviour of nsp11 in the presence of membrane mimetic environment, alpha helix inducer, and natural osmolyte. In the presence of negatively charged and neutral liposomes, nsp11 remains disordered. However, with SDS micelle, it adopted an -helical conformation, suggesting the helical propensity of nsp11. At the end, we again confirmed the IDP behaviour of nsp11 using molecular dynamics simulations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kundlik Gadhave","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Ankur Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Taniya Bhardwaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Neha Garg","author_inst":"Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Rajanish Giri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Agnel Praveen Joseph","author_inst":"Science and Technology Facilities Council, UK"},{"author_name":"Luise Kandler","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Kippes","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ferdinand Kirsten","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Konstantin M\u00fcller","author_inst":"RVZ, University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kristopher Nolte","author_inst":"HARBOR, Unversity of Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Payne","author_inst":"Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew G.

There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roy H.

Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population. Materials and methods: Females with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg\/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg\/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg\/kg\/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression. Results: In total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 +- 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 +- 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 +- 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 +- 0.5), headache (1.2 +- 0.5), dry cough (1.2 +- 61617; 0.5), myalgia (1.2 +- 0.4), nauseas (1.3 +- 0.5) and weakness (1.3 +- 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication. Conclusions: A sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavio A Cadegiani","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos Gustavo Wambier","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Andy Goren","author_inst":"Applied Biology Inc."},{"author_name":"Jessica M.

Methods The primary objective was to assess the time-course evolution of CFR of COVID-19 in all countries with available data and secondary objective was to evaluate associations between country-wise CFR and country-level health, human development, demographic and economic parameters. Day-wise data of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country was extracted from a public repository and countries with at least 1000 cases on cutoff date were clustered by unsupervised kmeans on the basis of deaths per 100000 population (DP100K). Day-wise CFR (cumulative deaths divided by cumulative cases, multiplied by 100) for each country and cluster (country group) was plotted as time-series and country-level parameters were tested for association with CFR using weighted multiple linear regression. Results On September 24, 2020 there were 32140504 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 981792 deaths reported from 184 countries for a worldwide CFR of 3.06 % (95%CI 3.05 -3.07). Unsupervised k-means clustering in 157 countries with at least 1000 reported cases resulted in Clusters (country groups) A, B, C, D and E with centroid DP100K and CFR of 0.100 and 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 0.503 and 2.28 (95% CI 2.23-2.33), 1.816 and 1.73 (95% CI 1.71-1.75), 7.395 and 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76),4 and 36.303 and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively. In a log-log analysis DP100K and CFR were significantly positively correlated (R=0.3570, p<0.001) with each other. All country groups and majority of included countries showed a pattern of gradually increasing CFR from the beginning of pandemic, followed by a plateau and then a steady decline in CFR. Among 10 country-level parameters, GDP per capita ({beta}=-0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population ({beta}=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality from air pollution ({beta}=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density ({beta}=-0.570, p< 0.000) were significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio ({beta}=0.431, p=0.000) and age ({beta}=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR. Conclusions The CFR of COVID-19 has gradually increased over time in majority of countries at various stages of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and a steady decline. Population level COVID-19 mortality burden and CFR are significantly positively associated with each other.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohan Chaubal","author_inst":"Department of Surgical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre & Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Sadhana Kannan","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Tata Memorial Centre & Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India."},{"author_name":"Navin Khattry","author_inst":"Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre & Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India."},{"author_name":"Sudeep Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre & Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India."},{"author_name":"Rose M.

The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications. Methods: COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as [&ge;] 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission and those who were pregnant. Results: Of 276 patients (mean age 59 {+\/-} 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race) who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer [&ge;] 2000 ng\/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng\/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer [&ge;] 2000 ng\/mL and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng\/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint. Conclusions: Admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events. Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Darwish Alabyad","author_inst":"Morehouse School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Srikant Rangaraju","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Liu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rajeel Imran","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christine Kempton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Milad Sharifpour","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sara Auld","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Manila Gaddh","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Roman Sniecinski","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Cheryl L Maier","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeannette Guarner","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Duncan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Fadi Nahab","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Matthew G.

Several high-performance commercial tests have been described, but these require centralised laboratory facilities that are comparatively expensive, and therefore not available universally. Red cell agglutination tests have a long history in blood typing, and general serology through linkage of reporter molecules to the red cell surface. They do not require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied as a Point of Care Test (POCT). We describe a red cell agglutination test for the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We show that the Haemagglutination Test (HAT) has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a PCR diagnosed infection. The HAT can be titrated, detects rising titres in the first five days of hospital admission, correlates well with a commercial test that detects antibodies to the RBD, and can be applied as a point of care test. The developing reagent is composed of a previously described nanobody to a conserved glycophorin A epitope on red cells, linked to the RBD from SARS-CoV-2. It can be lyophilised for ease of shipping. We have scaled up production of this reagent to one gram, which is sufficient for ten million tests, at a cost of ~0.27 UK pence per test well. Aliquots of this reagent are ready to be supplied to qualified groups anywhere in the world that need to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but do not have the facilities for high throughput commercial tests.","rel_num_authors":54,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of

created significant challenges to healthcare globally, necessitating rapid restructuring of service provision. This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services. Methods and Results The survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF), a UK HF patient charity. Survey Monkey was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the PMF online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (out-patient hospital and community HF clinics). 1050 responses were collected (693\/1050-66% women); 55% (579\/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID19 (mean 7+\/-2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared to anxiety regarding HF (6.1+\/-2.4; p<0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged <\/=60 years about HF (6.3+\/-2.2 versus 5.9+\/-2.5 in those aged >60 years; p=0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3+\/-2.3 versus 6.7+\/-2.6 those aged >60 years; p<0.001). 65% respondents (686\/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period. 37% reported disruption to medication prescription services and 34% reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. 32% expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients regarding COVID-19 and HF. Cancellation or postponement of scheduled clinic appointments, investigations, procedures, prescription and monitoring services were implicated as sources of anxiety.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajiv Sankaranarayanan","author_inst":"Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick

Illinois)","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.04.20206318","rel_abs":"Background Prior research has identified higher rates of COVID-19 mortality among people of color (relative to non-Hispanic whites) and populations in high-poverty neighborhoods (relative to wealthier neighborhoods). It is unclear, however, whether non-Hispanic whites in high-poverty neighborhoods experience elevated mortality, or whether people of color living in wealthy areas are relatively protected. Exploring socioeconomic position in combination with race\/ethnicity can lead to a more detailed understanding of the specific processes that result in COVID-19 inequities. Methods and Findings We used census and individual-level mortality data for the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic\/Latinx populations of Cook County, Illinois, USA. We excluded deaths related to nursing homes and other institutions. We calculated age and gender-adjusted mortality rates by race\/ethnicity, census tract poverty quartile, and age group (0-64 and [&ge;]65 years). Within all racial\/ethnic groups, COVID-19 mortality rates were greatest in the highest-poverty quartile and lowest in the lowest-poverty quartile. The mortality rate for younger non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was 13.5 times that of younger non-Hispanic whites in the lowest-poverty quartile (95% CI: 8.5, 21.4). For young people in the highest-poverty quartile, the non-Hispanic white and Black mortality rates were similar. Among younger people in the lowest-poverty quartile, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic\/Latinx people had mortality rates nearly three times that of non-Hispanic whites. For the older population, the mortality rate among non-Hispanic whites in the highest-poverty quartile was less than that of lowest-poverty non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic\/Latinx populations. Conclusions Our findings suggest racial\/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are partly, but not entirely, attributable to the higher average socioeconomic position of non-Hispanic whites relative to the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic\/Latinx populations. Future research on health equity in COVID-19 outcomes should collect and analyze individual-level data on the potential mechanisms driving population distributions of exposure, severe illness, and death.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin M Feldman","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Mary T Bassett","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Sam

prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 4,554 employees of a university hospital in Munich, Germany","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.04.20206136","rel_abs":"Background Hospital staff are at high risk of infection during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We analysed the exposure characteristics, efficacy of protective measures, and transmission dynamics in this hospital-wide prospective seroprevalence study. Methods and Findings Overall, 4554 individuals were tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Individual risk factors, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), occupational exposure, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and correlated to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres and PCR testing results. Odds ratios with corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate associations between individual factors and seropositivity. Spatio-temporal trajectories of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and staff mobility within the hospital were visualised to identify local hotspots of virus transmission. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody was 2.4% [95% CI 1.9-2.9]. Patient-facing staff, including those working in COVID-19 areas, had a similar probability of being seropositive as non-patient-facing staff. Prior interaction with SARS-CoV-2-infected co-workers or private contacts and unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients increased the probability of seropositivity. Loss of smell and taste had the highest positive predictive value for seropositivity. The rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 25.9%, and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres were observed in symptomatic individuals. Spatio-temporal hotspots of SARS-CoV-2-positive staff and patients only showed partial overlap. Conclusions Patient-facing work in a healthcare facility during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be safe if adequate PPE and hygiene measures are applied. The high numbers of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections that escaped detection by symptomatic testing underline the value of cross-sectional seroprevalence studies. Unprotected contact is a major risk factor for infection and argues for the rigorous implementation of hygiene measures.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johanna

For the study, we have considered the cumulative total numbers of cases in India, the United States and the World. We have found that the situation in the United States is already on the threshold of a change towards retardation. In the World as a whole also we have observed that a similar conclusion can be made. In India, the situation can be expected to move towards betterment soon, and once that happens the situation in the World as a whole would start improving. We shall demonstrate that as long as the rate of change of the logarithm of the cumulative total number of cases with respect to time in a pandemic continues to reduce, the pattern of growth would continue to remain nearly exponential, and as soon as it is seen that the rate of change starts to become nearly constant the growth can be expected to start to change towards a nearly logarithmic

proposes a surrogate method for understanding and analyzing the replication of SARS CoV-2 through fractal and inertia moment (IM) analysis of cell culture images at different stages. The fractal analysis of images of cell culture, calculated by the box-counting and power spectral density methods, reflect the stages of virus infection, leading to the replication of the virus RNA and damaging the host cell. The linear increase of IM value reveals not only the proliferation of SARS CoV-2 by replication but also damage to the host cell with time. Thus, the work shows the possibility of fractal analysis and IM measurement for understanding the dynamics of the virus infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"VIMAL

healthcare workers' knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAPs) can help to achieve the outcomes of planned behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize the current evidence on KAPs regarding COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed\/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 Jul 2020. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. PROSPERO registration code: (CRD42020186755). Results: Fifty-two studies encompassing 49786 participants were included in this review. 45.76% of the participants were male. The mean age of the participants was 32.6 years. 44.2% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 46.2% as fair quality, and remaining (9.6%) as low quality. 30.76% examined all three components of the KAPs model. The knowledge component was reported as good, fair, and poor in 59%, 34%, and 7%, respectively. Of the studies that examined the attitude component, 82% reported a positive attitude, 11% a fairly positive attitude, and 7% a negative attitude. For the practice component, 52% reported good practice, 44% fair practice, and 4% poor practice. Conclusion: This systematic review showed that the overall KAP components in the included studies were at an acceptable level. In general, knowledge was at a good level, the attitude was positive and practice was at a fairly good level. Using an integrated international system can help better evaluate these components and compare them between countries.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saeede

Little is known about the relationship between this ratio and the neutralizing capacity of plasma\/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2 virus. We measured the neutralizing capacity of 981 samples from 196 CCP donors 7-119 days post initial donation (DPID). Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Importantly, while 32.7%\/79.5% (PRNT90\/PRNT50) of donations met the FDA minimum titer of 1:80 initially, only 14.0%\/48.8% (PRNT90\/PRNT50) met this cut-off [&ge;]85 DPID. A subset of 91 donations were evaluated using the OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy. The correlation of OVSARS2IgG results to neutralizing capacity allowed extrapolation to CCP therapy efficacy results.

responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the current health crisis. Despite intensive research efforts, the genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19 remain poorly understood. We therefore used an integrative genomics (IG) approach to identify candidate genes responsible for COVID-19 and its severity. We used Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) and summary-based Mendelian randomization to combine gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Lung eQTL (n=1,038) and eQTLGen (n=31,784) studies with published COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Additionally, we used COLOC to integrate plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from the INTERVAL study (n=3,301) with COVID-19-associated loci. Finally, we determined any causal associations between plasma proteins and COVID-19 using multi-variable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). We found that the expression of 20 genes in lung and 31 genes in blood was associated with COVID-19. Of these genes, only three (LZTFL1, SLC6A20 and ABO) had been previously linked with COVID-19 in GWAS. The novel loci included genes involved in interferon pathways (IL10RB, IFNAR2 and OAS1). Plasma ABO protein, which is associated with blood type in humans, demonstrated a significant causal relationship with COVID-19 in MR analysis; increased plasma levels were associated with an increased risk of having COVID-19 and risk of severe COVID-19. In summary, our study identified genes associated with COVID-19 that may be prioritized for future investigation. Importantly, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal association between plasma ABO protein and COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana I Hernandez

We contributes by analyzing the Argentinian case through information of mobility and contagion given answers to recurrent questions on these topics. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing the effects of lockdown measures and the regional relaxation on the numbers of rate of new infections. We also respond to issues of internal political discussion on regional contagion and the effect of marches and unexpected crowd events.We use pool, fixed and random effects panel data modeling and Granger causality tests identifying relations between mobility and contagion. Our results show that lockdown in Argentina has been effective in reducing the mobility but not in way that reduces the rate of contagion. Strict lockdown seems to be effective in short periods of time and by extend it without complementary measures loss effectiveness. Contagion rate seems to be discretely displaced in time and resurging amidst slowly increasing in mobility.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan M.C.

The addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges\/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan. Objectives. To determine whether a college\/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: We assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted\/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing\/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Testing costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing. Results: Including baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: While regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youngji Jo","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ruby Singh","author_inst":"Boston

challenge to healthcare systems around the world. To mitigate the risks of those referred with possible colorectal cancer during the pandemic we implemented a clinical pathway which required a customised data management system for robust operation. Here, we describe the principal concepts and evaluation of the performance of a spreadsheet-based data management system. Methods: A system was developed using Microsoft Excel 2007 aiming to retain the spreadsheets inherent intuitiveness of direct data entry. Data was itemised limiting entry errors. Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was used to construct a user-friendly interface to enhance efficiency of data entry and segregate the data required for operational tasks. This was done with built-in loop-back data entry. Finally data derivation and analysis was performed to facilitate pathway monitoring. Results: For a pathway which required rapid implementation and development of a customised data management system, the use of a spreadsheet was advantageous due to its user-friendly direct data entry capability. Its function was enhanced by UserForm and large data handling by data segregation using VBA macros. Data validation and conditional formatting minimised data entry errors. Computation by the COUNT function facilitated live data monitoring on a dashboard. During the three months the pathway ran for, the system processed 36 nodal data points for each of the included 837 patients. Data monitoring confirmed its accuracy. Conclusion: Large volume data management using a spreadsheet system is possible with appropriate data definition and VBA programmed data segregation. Regular input and optimisation by clinicians made the system adaptable for rapid implementation.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frances Gunn","author_inst":"1.\tDepartment of Colorectal Surgery, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Janice Miller","author_inst":"1.\tDepartment of Colorectal Surgery, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 2.

The rising number of trials has led to duplication and a need for curation of available outcomes from treatments that have been followed across the world. We have conducted a systematic review and meta analysis that focus on evaluating the clinical outcomes of repurposed drugs against COVID-19 including Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Dexamethasome, Lopinavir-ritonavir, Favipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Convalescent plasma therapy. Twenty-nine articles were included in this study after thorough literature search and performed subgroup analyses based on disease severity levels. Random effects model was adopted to estimate overall treatment effect and heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis on mortality rate showed significant overall effect in the treatment group of studies having critically ill patients (p<0.01).Overall, our study confirmed that tocilizumab may probably reduce the mortality (<10%) of patients with COVID-19 with faster recovery time and reduce the risk of patients with lung disease in falling into oxygen support (P = 0.02). Patients on remedesivir showed no significant associations of comorbidities with risk of falling into oxygen supports. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be inefficacious in COVID-19 patients (OR 0.64; 95%CI [0.47-0.86]).Dexamethasone had marginal effect on overall mortality rate (OR 1.19; 95%CI [1.05-1.35]), and hence helpful for patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO. There was also evidence suggesting that combination therapies (serpin + Favipiravir) were helpful in reducing the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients under invasive support.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esther Jebarani Elangovan","author_inst":"Anna University"},{"author_name":"Vanitha Shyamili Kumar","author_inst":"IIT

non-pharmaceutical interventions on early Covid-19 mortality: natural experiment in 130 countries","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.05.20206888","rel_abs":"Background Concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented around the world to control Covid-19 transmission. Their general effect on reducing virus transmission is proven, but they can also be negative to mental health and economies, and transmission behaviours can also change in absence of mandated policies. Their relative impact on Covid-19 attributed mortality rates, enabling policy selection for maximal benefit with minimal disruption, is not well established. Methods We exploited variations in nine non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 130 countries (3250 observations) in two periods chosen to limit reverse causality: i) prior to first Covid-19 death (when policymakers could not possibly be reacting to deaths in their own country); and, ii) 14-days-post first Covid-19 death (when deaths were still low, on average). We examined associations with daily deaths per million in each subsequent 24-day period (the time between virus transmission and mortality) which could only be affected by the policy period. A mean score of strictness and timeliness was coded for each intervention. Days in each country were indexed in time by first reported Covid-19 death to proxy for virus transmission rate. Multivariable linear regression models of Covid-19 mortality rates on all concurrent interventions were adjusted for seasonality, potential confounders, and potential cross-country differences in their mortality definitions. Robustness was checked by removing countries with known data reporting issues and with non-linear, negative binomial, models. Results After adjusting for multiple concurrent interventions and confounders, and accounting for both timing and strictness of interventions, earlier and stricter school (-1.23 daily deaths per million, 95% CI -2.20 -0.27) and workplace closures (-0.26, 95% CI -0.46 -0.05) were associated with lower Covid-19 mortality rates. Only controlling for strictness international travel controls, and only controlling for timing later restrictions on gatherings, were also associated with lower Covid-19 mortality. Other interventions, such as stay-at-home orders or restrictions on public transport, were not significantly associated with differences in mortality rates across countries. Findings were robust across multiple statistical approaches. Conclusions Focusing on compulsory, particularly school closing, not voluntary reduction of social interactions with mandated policies appears to have been the most effective strategy to mitigate early Covid-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan Stokes","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Alex James Turner","author_inst":"University of
