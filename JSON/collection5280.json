In a national study, we evaluated the association of ACE inhibitors and ARB with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) hospitalization and mortality among individuals with hypertension. Methods: Among Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals, we identified 2,263 people with hypertension, receiving [&ge;]1 antihypertensive agents, and who had a positive outpatient SARS-CoV-2 test (outpatient cohort). In a propensity score-matched analysis, we determined the association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. In a second study of 7,933 individuals with hypertension who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (inpatient cohort), we tested the association of these medications with in-hospital mortality. We stratified all our assessments by insurance groups. Results: Among individuals in the outpatient and inpatient cohorts, 31.9% and 29.8%, respectively, used ACE inhibitors and 32.3% and 28.1% used ARBs. In the outpatient study, over a median 30.0 (19.0 - 40.0) days after testing positive, 12.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19. In propensity score-matched analyses, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.77 [0.53, 1.13], P = 0.18), nor ARBs (HR, 0.88 [0.61, 1.26], P = 0.48), were significantly associated with risk of hospitalization. In analyses stratified by insurance group, ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, were associated with a significant lower risk of hospitalization in the Medicare group (HR, 0.61 [0.41, 0.93], P = 0.02), but not the commercially insured group (HR: 2.14 [0.82, 5.60], P = 0.12; P-interaction 0.09). In the inpatient study, 14.2% died, 59.5% survived to discharge, and 26.3% had an ongoing hospitalization. In propensity score-matched analyses, neither use of ACE inhibitor (0.97 [0.81, 1.16]; P = 0.74) nor ARB (1.15 [0.95, 1.38]; P = 0.15) was associated with risk of in-hospital mortality, in total or in the stratified analyses. Conclusions: The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was not associated with the risk of hospitalization or mortality among those infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there was a nearly 40% lower risk of hospitalization with the use of ACE inhibitors in the Medicare population. This finding merits a clinical trial to evaluate the potential role of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of hospitalization among older individuals, who are at an elevated risk of adverse outcomes with the infection.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohan Khera","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Callahan Clark","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Yuan Lu","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yinglong Guo","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Sheng Ren","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Brandon Truax","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Erica S Spatz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karthik Murugiah","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiu Lin","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Harlan M Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20076687","rel_title":"COVID-19: disease pathways and gene expression changes predict methylprednisolone can improve outcome in severe cases","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20076687","rel_abs":"Background. Current management efforts of COVID-19 include: early diagnosis, use of antivirals and immune modulation. After the initial viral phase of the illness, identification of the patients developing cytokine storm syndrome is critical. Treatment of this hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce the rising mortality. Methods. Using data from an A549 cell line, primary human bronchial epithelial (NBHE), as well as from COVID-19-infected lung, we compare the changes in the gene expression, pathways and mechanisms between SARS-CoV2, influenza A, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results. We identified FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. An important finding is that drugs in the same class will not achieve similar effects. For instance methylprednisolone and prednisolone were predicted to be effective in reverting many of the changes triggered by COVID-19, while other closely related steroids, such as prednisone or dexamethasone, were not. An independent clinical study evaluated 213 subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-methylprednisolone groups, respectively. The composite end point was composed of escalation to intensive care units, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-methylprednisolone group compared to pre-methylprednisolone group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). Conclusion. Clinical results confirmed the efficacy of the in silico prediction that indicated methyl- prednisolone could improve outcomes in severe COVID-19. These findings are important for any future pandemic regardless of the virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sorin Draghici","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Tuan-Minh Nguyen","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Larry A Sonna","author_inst":"Bon Air Consulting"},{"author_name":"Cordelia Ziraldo","author_inst":"Advaita Bioinformatics"},{"author_name":"Radu L Vanciu","author_inst":"Advaita Bioinformatics"},{"author_name":"Raef Fadel","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Austin Morrison","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Mayur Ramesh","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Gil Mor","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Harlan M Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105197","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in health care workers","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105197","rel_abs":"Background The correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and their longevity remain unclear. Studies in severely ill individuals have identified robust cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has also been described, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to produce antibody responses. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study recruiting 554 health care workers from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who were at work and asymptomatic. Participants were tested for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction and for seroconversion by the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results were interpreted in the context of previous, self-reported symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19. Results The point prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, determined by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharnygeal swab was 2.39% (n=13\/544). Serum was available on 516 participants. The overall rate of seroconversion in the cohort was 24.4% (n=126\/516). Individuals who had previously experienced a symptomatic illness consistent with COVID-19 had significantly greater seroconversion rates than those who had remained asymptomatic (37.5% vs 17.1%, {chi}2 =21.1034, p<0.0001). In the week preceding peak COVID-19-related mortality at UHBFT, seroconversion rates amongst those who were suffering from symptomatic illnesses peaked at 77.8%. Prior symptomatic illness generated quantitatively higher antibody responses than asymptomatic seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest amongst those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%) with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%) and emergency medicine (13.3%). Conclusions In a large cross-sectional seroprevalence study of health-care workers, we demonstrate that asymptomatic seroconversion occurs, however prior symptomatic illness is associated with quantitatively higher antibody responses. The identification that the potential for seroconversion in health-care workers can associate differentially with certain hospital departments may inform future infection control and occupational health practices.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian M Shields","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of

medical fraternity also expressed concerns regarding public health strategies of government and hospital readiness in response to upgoing case surge. To gauge such response, we assessed service availability and Infection prevention and control (IPC) status in 110 hospitals situated across seven provinces. An electronic survey was sent out to the frontline clinicians working on those hospitals between 24th March and 7th April 2020; one response per hospital was analyzed. Hospitals were divided into small, medium, and large based on the total number of beds (small:<=15; medium:16-50; large:>50), and further categorized into public, private, and mixed based on the ownership. Out of 110 hospitals, 81% (22\/27) of small, 39% (11\/28) of medium, and 33% (18\/55) of large hospitals had not allocated isolation beds for COVID-19 suspects. All small, majority of medium (89%; 25\/28), and 50% of large hospitals did not have a functional intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of study. Nasopharyngeal (NP)\/throat swab kits were available in one-third (35\/110), whereas viral transport media (VTM), portable fridge box, and refrigerator were available in one-fifth (20%) of hospitals. Only one hospital (large\/tertiary) had a functional PCR machine. Except for General practitioners, other health cadres- crucial during pandemics, were low in number. On IPC measures, the supplies of simple face masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers were adequate in the majority of hospitals, however, N95-respirators, Filter masks, and PPE-suits were grossly lacking. Government COVID-19 support was unevenly distributed across provinces; health facilities in Province 2, Gandaki, and Province 5 received fewer resources than others. Our findings alert the Nepalese and other governments to act early and proactively during health emergencies and not wait until the disease disrupts their health systems. Other countries of similar economic levels may undertake similar surveys to measure and improve their pandemic response.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suraj

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic in March 2020, may present with disproportionately higher rates in underrepresented racial\/ethnic minority populations in the United States, including African American communities who have traditionally been over-represented in negative health outcomes. Study Objective: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. Setting: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. Participants: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. Main outcome measures: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. Results: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). Conclusion: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elena Cyrus","author_inst":"Florida International University (FIU)"},{"author_name":"Rachel Clarke","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Dexter Hadley","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Zoran Bursac","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Mary Jo Trepka","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Jessy G Devieux","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Ulas Bagci","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Debra Furr-Holden","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Makella S Coudray","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Yandra Mariano","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Sandra Kiplagat","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Ines Noel","author_inst":"University of San Diego"},{"author_name":"Gira Ravelo","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Michelle Paley","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Eric F Wagner","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Dee McLoughlin","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Morley","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Danai Papakonstantinou","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pickles","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Poxon","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Eloise Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Kasun Wanigasooriya","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Celina Whalley","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka E Zielinska","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"David C Wraith","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Beggs","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.104281","rel_title":"Isolation of and Characterization of Neutralizing Antibodies to Covid-19 from a Large Human Nai\u0308ve scFv Phage Display Library","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.104281","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) has caused currently ongoing global plague and imposed great challenges to health managing systems all over the world, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths.

In the present study, to better understand the biological impact of superinfection we sought to determine and compare the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 versus Aspergillus superinfection, using a model of reconstituted humain airway epithelium. Our analyses reveal that both simple infection and superinfection induce a strong deregulation of core components of innate immune and inflammatory responses, with a stronger response to superinfection in the bronchial epithelial model compared to its nasal counterpart. Our results also highlight unique transcriptional footprints of SARS-CoV-2 Aspergillus superinfection, such as an imbalanced type I\/type III IFN, and an induction of several monocyte- and neutrophil associated chemokines, that could be useful for the understanding of Aspergillus-associated COVID-19 and but also management of severe forms of aspergillosis in this specific

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, sequence variations and possibly structural changes in the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 is highly expected in the coming months. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is responsible for mediating viral attachment and fusion with cell membranes. Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and specific sites of S-protein have undergone positive selection impacting the viral pathogenicity. In the present work, we used high-throughput computation to design 100,000 mutants in RBD interfacial residues and identify novel affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations at the interfacial residues in RBD. Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests that a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection. Knowledge of the affinity-enhancing mutations may guide the identification of potential cold-spots for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of hot-spots, and vice versa. Understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and host protein presents a detailed systems view of viral infection mechanisms. The applications of the present research can be explored in multiple antiviral strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccine design, and importantly in understanding the clinical pathogenesis of the virus itself. Our work presents research directions for the exploitation of non-conventional solutions for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya K.

The structure of this genetic diversity, and whether it reveals epidemiological insights, are fundamental questions for understanding the evolutionary trajectory of this virus. Here we use a recently developed phylodynamic approach to uncover phylogenetic structures underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We find support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example, Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions responsible for viral replication and cell entry. Even though Lineages A and B had distinct demographic patterns, they were much more difficult to distinguish. Continuous application of phylogenetic approaches to track the evolutionary epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages will be increasingly important to validate the efficacy of control efforts and monitor significant evolutionary events in the future.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas M Fountain-Jones","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Raima Carol Appaw","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Scott Carver","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Xavier Didelot","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Charleston","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Thomas Julien","author_inst":"CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, (Team VirPath)"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Traversier","author_inst":"CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, (Team VirPath)"},{"author_name":"Victoria Duliere","author_inst":"CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, (Team VirPath)"},{"author_name":"Pauline Brun","author_inst":"CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, (Team VirPath)"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, (Team VirPath)"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calatrava","author_inst":"CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, (Team VirPath)"},{"author_name":"Olivier Terrier","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Michelle Paley","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Eric F Wagner","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Dee McLoughlin","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Morley","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Danai Papakonstantinou","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pickles","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Poxon","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Eloise Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Kasun Wanigasooriya","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Celina Whalley","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka E Zielinska","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"David C Wraith","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Beggs","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.097410","rel_title":"The impact of super-spreaders in COVID-19: mapping genome variation worldwide","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.097410","rel_abs":"The human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the major pandemic of the 21st century.

Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga(R), (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAn analogue of Cerdelga(R), an FDA-approved drug, is effective against a broad range of RNA-viruses including the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Einat B.

The images clearly outline the presence of a \"Corona\" like morphology, and uniform size distribution.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kajal Arora","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Ruchir Rastogi","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Nupur Mehrotra Arora","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Deepak Parashar","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Jeny Paliwal","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Aelia Naqvi","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Apoorva Srivastava","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Sudhir K Singh","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Sriganesh Kalyanaraman","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Swaroop Potdar","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Devanand Kumar","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Vidya Bhushan Arya","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Sarthi Bansal","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Satabdi Rautray","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Indrajeet Singh","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Surendra Fengade","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Bibekanand Kumar","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Prabuddha K Kundu","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pickles","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Poxon","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Eloise Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Kasun Wanigasooriya","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Celina Whalley","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka E Zielinska","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"David C Wraith","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Beggs","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.104117","rel_title":"Human IgG cell neutralizing monoclonal antibodies block SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.104117","rel_abs":"The coronavirus induced disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide threat to human lives, and neutralizing antibodies present a great therapeutic potential in curing affected patients. We purified more than one thousand memory B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD (receptor binding domain) antigens from 11 convalescent COVID-19 patients, and a total of 729 naturally paired heavy and light chain fragments were obtained by single B cell cloning technology. Among these, 178 recombinant monoclonal antibodies were tested positive for antigen binding, and the top 13 binders with Kd below 0.5 nM are all RBD binders. Importantly, all these 13 antibodies could block pseudoviral entry into HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2, with the best ones showing IC50s around 2-3 nM. We further identified 8 neutralizing antibodies against authentic virus with IC50s within 10 nM. Among these, 414-1 blocked authentic viral entry at IC50 of 1.75 nM and in combination with 105-38 could achieve IC50 as low as 0.45 nM. Meanwhile, we also found that 3 antibodies could cross-react with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Altogether, our study provided a panel of potent human neutralizing antibodies for COVID19 as therapeutics candidates for further

between the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in France and the level of participation at national elections. Design: Observational study and dynamic modelling using a sigmoidal mixed effects model. Setting: All hospitals where patients were admitted for COVID-19. Participants: All admitted patients from March 18, 2020 to April 17, 2020. Main outcome measures: Abstention and admission rate for COVID-19. Results: Mean abstention rate in 2020 among departments was 52.5%+\/-6.4 and had increased by a mean of 18.8% as compared with the 2014 election. There was a high degree of similarity of abstention between the two elections among the departments (p<0.001). Among departments with a high outbreak intensity before the election, those with a higher participation were not affected by a significantly higher number of COVID-19 admissions after the elections. The sigmoidal model fitted the data from the different departments with a high degree of consistency. The covariate analysis showed that a significant association between participation and number of admitted patients was observed for both elections (2020: B=-5.36, p<1e-9 and 2014: B=-3.15, p<1e-6) contradicting a direct specific causation of the 2020 election. Participation was not associated with the position of the inflexion point suggesting no effect in the speed of spread. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the surrounding intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in France did not have any local impact on citizens participation to a national election. The level of participation to the 2020 election had no impact on the spread of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean-David Zeitoun","author_inst":"Assistance Publique

have released Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) guidelines for the allocation of scarce critical care resources. Most guidelines rely on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to maximize lives saved, but states have adopted different stances on whether to maximize long-term outcomes (life-years saved) by accounting for patient comorbidities. Methods: We compared 4 representative state guidelines with varying approaches to comorbidities and analyzed how CSC prioritization correlates with clinical outcomes. We included 27 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs at Brigham and Women's Hospital from March 12 to April 3, 2020. We compared prioritization algorithms from New York, which assigns priority based on SOFA alone; Maryland, which uses SOFA plus severe comorbidities; Pennsylvania, which uses SOFA plus major and severe comorbidities; and Colorado, which uses SOFA plus a modified Charlson comorbidity index. Results: In pairwise comparisons across all possible pairs, we found that state guidelines frequently resulted in tie-breakers based on age or lottery: New York 100% of the time (100% resolved by lottery), Pennsylvania 86% of the time (18% by lottery), Maryland 93% of the time (35% by lottery), and Colorado: 32% of the time (10% by lottery). The prioritization algorithm with the strongest correlation with 14-day outcomes was Colorado (rs = -0.483. p = 0.011) followed by Maryland (rs = -0.394, p =0.042), Pennsylvania (rs = -0.382, p = 0.049), and New York (rs = 0). An alternative model using raw SOFA scores alone was moderately correlated with outcomes (rs = -0.448, p = 0.019). Conclusions: State guidelines for scarce resource allocation frequently resulted in identical priority scores, requiring tie-breakers based on age or lottery. These findings suggest that state CSC guidelines should be further assessed empirically to understand whether they meet their goals.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia L.

Patients with COVID-19 also exhibited significantly reduced proportions of neutrophils and macrophages, and increased proportions of goblet, dendritic and B-cells, compared to other viral ARIs. Using machine learning, we built 26-, 10- and 3-gene classifiers that differentiated COVID-19 from other acute respiratory illnesses with AUCs of 0.980, 0.950 and 0.871, respectively.

Interferon beta1 has shown in vitro studies a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In an in vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 had more sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment that SARS-CoV. A combination of IFN beta1b administered subcutaneously with other antiviral treatments has been recommended in several guidelines. However, clinical trial results for the treatment of COVID-19 are pending. We aimed to assess the efficiency of IFN beta1b in COVID19 comparing the in-hospital mortality between patients who received IFN beta1b and patients did not receive. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 between February 23th and April 4th, 2020, at the Central Defense Hospital (Madrid, Spain). Subcutaneous interferon beta-1b was recommended in moderate-severe pneumonia. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with in-hospital mortality. Findings We analyzed 256 patients (106 patients in interferon group and 150 patients in control group). At admission, patients who did not receive interferon beta1b presented a greater number of comorbidities. The overall mortality rate was 24.6% (63\/256). Twenty-two patients (20.8%) in the interferon group died and 41 (27.3%) in the control group (p=0.229). In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age, severity of clinical picture at admission and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Interpretation In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, interferon beta1b treatment was not associated to decrease in-hospital mortality.

This study aims to explore how risks of infection interact across age groups using data from South Korea. Methods: Daily new COVID-19 cases from March 10 to April 30, 2020 were scraped from online open sources. A multivariate vector autoregressive model for time series count data was used to examine the risk interactions across age groups. Case counts from previous days were included as predictors to dynamically examine the change of risk patterns. Results: In South Korea, the risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people was significantly affected by other age groups. An increase of virus infection among people aged 20-39 was associated with a double risk of infection among elderly people. Meanwhile, an increase in virus infection among elderly people was also significantly associated with risks of infection among other age groups. The risks of infection among younger people were relatively unaffected by that of other age groups. Conclusions: Protecting elderly people from coronavirus infection could not only reduce the risk of infection among themselves but also ameliorate the risks of virus infection among other age groups. Such interventions should be effective and for long term.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhua Yu","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"German Ramirez-Olivencia","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Mata","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Marti","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlos Gutierrez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Begona De  Dios","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Herrero","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ana Roel","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Martinez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Aguirre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco Alcantara Nicolas","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez Gonzalez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Lopez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucia E Ballester","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Mateo-Maestre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sergio Campos","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria J Sanchez-Carrillo","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fe","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Membrillo de Novales","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Christenson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Celina Whalley","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka E Zielinska","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"David C Wraith","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Beggs","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.101485","rel_title":"Does the human placenta express the canonical cell entry mediators for SARS-CoV-2?","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.101485","rel_abs":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 3.8 million people, including pregnant women.

This new coronavirus canonically utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for cell entry. Herein, building upon our previous single cell study of the placenta (Pique-Regi, 2019), another study, and new single-cell\/nuclei RNA-sequencing data, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 throughout pregnancy as well as in third-trimester chorioamniotic membranes. We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2 at any stage of pregnancy. In contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus which cause congenital infections are highly expressed by placental cell types. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to infect the human placenta through the canonical cell entry mediators; yet, other interacting proteins could still play a role in the viral infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roger Pique-Regi","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Roberto Romero","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Adi L Tarca","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Francesca Luca","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Yi Xu","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Yaozhu Leng","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Chaur-Dong Hsu","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Nardhy Gomez-Lopez","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Martinez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Aguirre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco Alcantara Nicolas","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez Gonzalez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Lopez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucia E Ballester","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Mateo-Maestre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sergio Campos","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria J Sanchez-Carrillo","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fe","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Membrillo de Novales","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Christenson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Celina Whalley","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka E Zielinska","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"David C Wraith","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Beggs","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.100545","rel_title":"Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the dynamics of T cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.100545","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19 infection. In both donors we identified SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones, suggesting the existence of immunodominant epitopes.

The highly flexible S-protein, with its mobile domains, presents a moving target to the immune system. Here, to better understand S-protein mobility, we implemented a structure-based vector analysis of available {beta}-CoV S-protein structures. We found that despite overall similarity in domain organization, different {beta}-CoV strains display distinct S-protein configurations. Based on this analysis, we developed two soluble ectodomain constructs in which the highly immunogenic and mobile receptor binding domain (RBD) is locked in either the all-RBDs  down position or is induced to display a previously unobserved in SARS-CoV-2 2-RBDs  up configuration. These results demonstrate that the conformation of the S-protein can be controlled via rational design and provide a framework for the development of engineered coronavirus spike proteins for vaccine applications.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rory Henderson","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Edwards","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Mansouri","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Janowska","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Stalls","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gobeil","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Megan Kopp","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Allen L Hsu","author_inst":"NIH\/NIEHS"},{"author_name":"Mario J.

Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2.

We compared the neutralizing activities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, as well as ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays and find an exceptionally high degree of concordance. The two assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-based countermeasures including therapeutic antibodies, immune {gamma}-globulin or plasma preparations, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

The iminosugar Miglustat is a well-characterized drug for the treatment of rare genetic lysosome storage diseases such as Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C, and has also been described to be active against a variety of enveloped viruses. The activity of Miglustat is here demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations achievable in the plasma by current clinical regimens without cytotoxicity. The drug acts at the post-entry level and leads to a marked decrease of viral proteins and release of infectious virus. The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity towards -glucosidases that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein. The wealth of available data on the clinical use of Miglustat for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and the antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 make it an ideal candidate for drug repurposing.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sreejith Rajasekharan","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Milan Bonotto","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Yvette Kazungu","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Lais Nascimento Alves","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Monica Poggianella","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Pamela Martinez Orellana","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Natasa Skoko","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Sulena Polez","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Marcello","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Lindsay Droit","author_inst":"Departments of Molecular Microbiology, Pathology & Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."},{"author_name":"Ma.

From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. This allows the government to program the measures to loosen lockdown restrictions for the so called \"Phase 2\". Here we provided the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24th to April 24th, 2020 across two months into the epidemic. Our estimates suggest basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29, confirming that epidemiological figures of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy are higher than those observed at the early stage of Wuhan (China) outbreak. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to low the reproduction number under the unity (control regime). We estimated that among the worst hit regions in Italy, Lombardy reached the control regime on March 22nd followed by Emilia-Romagna (March 23th), Veneto (March 25th) and Piemonte (March 26th). Overall, we found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime in all the country is about 31 days from the February 24th and about 14 days from the first day of nationwide lockdown (March 12th). Finally, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two demographic indices in order to probe the \"state of activity\" of the epidemic for each Italian region in the control regime. We believe that this approach can provide a tool in the management of \"Phase 2\", potentially helping in challenging decision to continue, ease or tighten up restrictions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mattia Allieta","author_inst":"independent researcher"},{"author_name":"Andrea Allieta","author_inst":"Universita del Piemonte Orientale A.

The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem. Methods We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimising hospital acquired COVID-19 particularly to patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission. Results 93 patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. 28 (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C & D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients. Discussion Application of a clinical triage tool to guide isolation and cohorting decisions may reduce the risk of hospital acquired transmission of COVID-19 especially to individuals at the greatest of risk of severe disease.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Patterson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Marks","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gemma Martinez-Garcia","author_inst":"Division of Infection, University College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Bidwell","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Akish Luintel","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Dalia Ludwig","author_inst":"Department of Acute Medicine, University College London"},{"author_name":"Tom Parks","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Gothard","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Rik Thomas","author_inst":"Intensive Care, University College London"},{"author_name":"Sarah Logan","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Karen Shaw","author_inst":"Division of Infection, University College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Stone","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Mike Brown","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey P Henderson","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."},{"author_name":"Shane Miersch","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Mart Ustav","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Sachdev Sidhu","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Herbert W Virgin","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Siyuan Ding","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elitza S Theel","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Departments of Molecular Microbiology, Pathology & Immunology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, and The Andrew M. and Jane M.
