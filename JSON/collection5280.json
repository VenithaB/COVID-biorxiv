Methods: This study evaluated the association of underlying CVD with disease progression in patients with mild COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need to be transferred to intensive care due to disease progression. The patients were divided with and without CVD as well as stable and intensive care groups. Results: Of 332 patients with mild COVID-19, median age was 51 years (IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Of 48 (14.5%) patients with CVD, 23 (47.9%) progressed to severe disease status and required intensive care. Compared with patients without CVD, patients with CVD were older, and more likely to have fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia. The rate of requiring intensive care was significantly higher among patients with CVD than in patients without CVD (47.92% vs. 12.4%; P<0.001). In subgroup analysis, rate of requiring intensive care was also higher among patients with either hypertension or coronary heart disease than in patients without hypertension or coronary heart disease. The multivariable regression model showed CVD served as an independent risk factor for intensive care (Odd ratio [OR], 2.652 [95% CI, 1.019-6.899]) after adjustment for various cofounders. Conclusions: Patients with mild COVID-19 complicating CVD in are susceptible to develop severe disease status and requirement for intensive care.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shi Tai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Tang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Bilian Yu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Tang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yang Wang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Huilin Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Weihong Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Kui Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Wen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chongqing Tan","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhongbiao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuanhao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuping Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20109397","rel_title":"Investigational treatments for COVID-19 may increase ventricular arrhythmia risk through drug interactions","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20109397","rel_abs":"Many drugs that have been proposed for treatment of COVID-19 are reported to cause cardiac adverse events, including ventricular arrhythmias. In order to properly weigh risks against potential benefits, particularly when decisions must be made quickly, mathematical modeling of both drug disposition and drug action can be useful for predicting patient response and making informed decisions. Here we explored the potential effects on cardiac electrophysiology of 4 drugs proposed to treat COVID-19: lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, and azithromycin, as well as combination therapy involving these drugs. Our study combined simulations of pharmacokinetics (PK) with quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling of ventricular myocytes to predict potential cardiac adverse events caused by these treatments. Simulation results predicted that drug combinations can lead to greater cellular action potential prolongation, analogous to QT prolongation, compared with drugs given in isolation. The combination effect can result from both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Importantly, simulations of different patient groups predicted that females with pre-existing heart disease are especially susceptible to drug-induced arrhythmias, compared males with disease or healthy individuals of either sex. Overall, the results illustrate how PK and QSP modeling may be combined to more precisely predict cardiac risks of COVID-19 therapies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meera Varshneya","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Itziar Irurzun-Arana","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chiara Campana","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rafael Dariolli","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Amy Gutierrez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Taylor K Pullinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric A Sobie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kui Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Wen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chongqing Tan","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhongbiao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuanhao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuping Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110064","rel_title":"Estimation of the Final Size of the COVID-19 Epidemic inBalochistan, Pakistan.","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110064","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a new disease that is spreading very fast in Pakistan.

Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West-Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West-Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West-Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to eliminate the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West-African COVID-19 data project a 60% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 53% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination, while disease elimination is also possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 2 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic humans are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 3 days then only about a 31% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures caused the time-dependent effective reproduction number to reduce by approximately 37% from February 28, to August 24, 2020. We conclude that COVID-19 elimination requires more control measures than what is currently being applied inWest-Africa and that mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early is very important in curtailing the burden of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beaugard Hemaho Taboe","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"},{"author_name":"Valere Kolawole Salako","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'Estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"},{"author_name":"Calistus N Ngonghala","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Romain GLELE KAKAI","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'Estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"},{"author_name":"Amy Gutierrez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Taylor K Pullinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric A Sobie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kui Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Wen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chongqing Tan","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhongbiao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuanhao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuping Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20109934","rel_title":"Organizing Pneumonia of COVID-19: Time-dependent Evolution and Outcome in CT Findings","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20109934","rel_abs":"Objective: As a pandemic, a most-common pattern resembled organizing pneumonia (OP) has been identified by CT findings in novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We aimed to delineate the evolution of CT findings and outcome in OP of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: 106 COVID-19 patients with OP based on CT findings were retrospectively included and categorized into non-severe (mild\/common) and severe (severe\/critical) groups. CT features including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, linear opacities and total severity CT score were evaluated at three time intervals from symptom-onset to CT scan (day 0-7, day 8-14, day>14). Discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU or death), and pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or lesion residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed based on the CT features at different time interval. Results: 79(74.5%) patients were non-severe and 103(97.2%) were discharged at median day 25 (range, day 8-50) after symptom-onset. Of 67 patients with revisit CT at 2-4 weeks after discharge, 20(29.9%) had complete absorption of lesions at median day 38 (range, day 30-53) after symptom-onset. Significant differences between complete absorption and residuals groups were found in percentages of consolidation (1.5% vs. 13.8%, P=0.010), number of involved lobe >3 (40.0% vs. 72.5%, P=0.030), CT score >4 (20.0% vs. 65.0%, P=0.010) at day 8-14. Conclusions: Most OP cases had good prognosis. Approximately one-third of cases had complete absorption of lesions during 1-2 months after symptom-onset while those with increased frequency of consolidation, number of involved lobe>3, and CT score >4 at week 2 after symptom-onset may indicate lesion residuals on CT.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Chao Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Carol C.

Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019 - February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sahli Costabal","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eran Bendavid","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayanta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Runqing Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zekun Wang","author_inst":"The Eighth Hospital of Xi.an"},{"author_name":"Fen Li","author_inst":"The Eighth Hospital of Xi.an"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Xi.an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shubao Cai","author_inst":"Xi.an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi.an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hao Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi.an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Li","author_inst":"Wuhan No.9 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yukun Liang","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhou","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xibin Wang","author_inst":"Hanzhong Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhuanqin Ren","author_inst":"Baoji Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20110890","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 entry related genes are comparably expressed in children's lung as adults","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20110890","rel_abs":"To explore whether the expression levels of viral-entry associated genes might contribute to the milder symptoms in children, we analysed the expression of these genes in both children and adults' lung tissues by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

The simulation considers individuals as agents moving randomly across the habitat according to predefined urban patterns. Agents carry a simple tracing device that identifies signals emitted by other agents, recording the position and time of the encounter. The information of every device is propagated daily to an epidemic observatory based on an online graph database. Infections are simulated as stochastic processes depending on the proximity among individuals. Different epidemic control strategies are tested with and without the information of the tracing device under several scenarios. We observe that the success of the strategies strongly depends on the duration of the period of infectiousness before the presence of symptoms and the fraction of asymptomatic agents. If these values are high, strategies based on the presence of symptoms or on testing campaigns can hardly contain the epidemic. Strategies using massive confinement of the agents are able to control the epidemic at the cost of sending a large fraction of the population into quarantine. In cases with moderate and low values for these parameters, the tracing devices can provide a slightly better performance but only if a large fraction of the agents carry the device. Otherwise, the impact of these devices is found to be negligible in comparison with other strategies not using them. Finally, we provide a methodology allowing to use the information of the graph database to estimate basic parameters of the disease such as the infection probability.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pablo Martinez Ruiz del Arbol","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Lara Lloret Iglesias","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Chen Wen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Ma","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qiao He","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, the Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyu Song","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Guocheng Shi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Minzhi Yin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Nan Fang","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xi Mo","author_inst":"The Laboratory of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University S"},{"author_name":"Yukun Liang","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhou","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xibin Wang","author_inst":"Hanzhong Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhuanqin Ren","author_inst":"Baoji Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20111047","rel_title":"Characteristics of Ischemic Stroke in COVID-19: A Need for Early Detection and Management","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20111047","rel_abs":"Objective: In the setting of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a potential association of this disease with stroke has been suggested. We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who were admitted with COVID-19 and had an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: This is a case series of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to an academic health system in metropolitan Atlanta (USA) between March 24th,2020, and May 5th, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics were described. Results: Of 124 ischemic stroke patients admitted during this study period, 8 (6.5%) were also diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 64.3 +\/- 6.5 years, 5 (62.5%) male, mean time from last-normal was 4.8 days [SD 4.8], and none received acute reperfusion therapy. All 8 patients had at least one stroke-associated co-morbidity. The predominant pattern of ischemic stroke was embolic; 3 were explained by atrial fibrillation while 5 (62.5%) were cryptogenic. In contrast, cryptogenic strokes were seen in 20 (16.1%) of 124 total stroke admissions during this time. Conclusions: In our case series, ischemic stroke affected COVID-19 patients with traditional stroke risk factors with an age of stroke presentation typically seen in non-COVID populations. We observed a predominantly embolic pattern of stroke with a higher than expected rate of cryptogenic strokes and with a prolonged median time to presentation and symptom recognition limiting the use of acute reperfusion treatments. These results highlight the need for increased community awareness, early identification, and management of AIS in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dinesh V.

Social distancing and lockdowns reduce community transmission but do not directly address household transmission. We provide quantitative measures of household transmission based on empirical data, and estimate the contribution of households to overall spread. We highlight policy implications from our analysis of household transmission, and more generally, of changes in contact patterns under social distancing. **Methods. ** We investigate the household secondary attack rate (SAR) for SARS-CoV-2, as well as R_h, which is the average number of within-household infections caused by a single index case. We identify previous works that estimated the SAR. We correct these estimates based on the false-negative rate of PCR testing and the failure to test asymptomatics. Results are pooled by a hierarchical Bayesian random-effects model to provide a meta-analysis estimate of the SAR. We estimate R_h using results from population testing in Vo', Italy and contact tracing data that we curate from Singapore. The code and data behind our analysis are publicly available https:\/\/github.com\/andrewilyas\/covid-household-transmission. **Results.** We identified nine studies of the household secondary attack rate. Our modeling suggests the SAR is heterogeneous across studies. The pooled central estimate of the SAR is 30% but with a posterior 95% credible interval of (0%, 67%) reflecting this heterogeneity. This corresponds to a posterior mean for the SAR of 30% (18%,43%) and a standard deviation of 15% (9%, 27%). If results are not corrected for false negatives and asymptomatics, the pooled central estimate for the SAR is 20% (0%, 43%). From the same nine studies, we estimate R_h to be 0.47 (0.13, 0.77). Using contact tracing data from Singapore, we infer an R_h value of 0.32 (0.22,0.42). Population testing data from Vo' yields an R_h estimate of 0.37 (0.34, 0.40) after correcting for false negatives and asymptomatics. **Interpretation.** Our estimates of R_h suggest that household transmission was a small fraction (5%-35%) of R before social distancing but a large fraction after (30%-55%). This suggests that household transmission may be an effective target for interventions. A remaining uncertainty is whether household infections actually contribute to further community transmission or are contained within households. This can be estimated given high-quality contact tracing data. More broadly, our study points to emerging contact patterns (i.e., increased time at home relative to the community) playing a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We briefly highlight another instance of this phenomenon (differences in contact between essential workers and the rest of the population), provide coarse estimates of its effect on transmission, and discuss how future data could enable a more reliable estimate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mihaela Curmei","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ilyas","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Owain Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jacob Steinhardt","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Premi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Antonella Alberici","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Baldelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Matteo Benini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110189","rel_title":"Explainable machine learning models to understand determinants of COVID-19 mortality in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110189","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is now one of the leading causes of mortality amongst adults in the United States for the year 2020. Multiple epidemiological models have been built, often based on limited data, to understand the spread and impact of the pandemic. However, many geographic and local factors may have played an important role in higher morbidity and mortality in certain populations. The goal of this study was to develop machine learning models to understand the relative association of socioeconomic, demographic, travel, and health care characteristics of different states across the United States and COVID-19 mortality. Using multiple public data sets, 24 variables linked to COVID-19 disease were chosen to build the models. Two independent machine learning models using CatBoost regression and random forest were developed. SHAP feature importance and a Boruta algorithm were used to elucidate the relative importance of features on COVID-19 mortality in the United States. Feature importances from both the categorical models, i.e., CatBoost and random forest consistently showed that a high population density, number of nursing homes, number of nursing home beds and foreign travel were strongest predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Percentage of African American amongst the population was also found to be of high importance in prediction of COVID-19 mortality whereas racial majority (primarily, Caucasian) was not. Both models fitted the data well with a training R2 of 0.99 and 0.88 respectively. The effect of median age,median income, climate and disease mitigation measures on COVID-19 related mortality remained unclear. COVID-19 policy making will need to take population density, pre-existing medical care and state travel policies into account. Our models identified and quantified the relative importance of each of these for mortality predictions using machine learning.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Piyush Mathur","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anya Mathur","author_inst":"Broadview-Brecksville Middle School"},{"author_name":"Ashish Kumar Khanna","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Kamal Maheshwari","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jacek B Cywinski","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Simran Dua","author_inst":"Lambert High School"},{"author_name":"Frank Papay","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Matteo Benini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111872","rel_title":"Predicting COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia Using Modified Singular Spectrum Analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111872","rel_abs":"This research presents a modified Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) approach for the analysis of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.

Design, Setting, and Participants Nationwide population-based cohort of all 228.677 consecutive Danish individuals tested (positive or negative) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA from the identification of the first COVID-19 case on February 27th, 2020 until April 30th, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures We examined characteristics and predictors of inpatient hospitalization versus community-management, and death versus survival, adjusted for age-, sex- and number of comorbidities. Results We identified 9,519 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases of whom 78% were community-managed, 22% were hospitalized (3.2% at an intensive care unit) and 5.5% had died within 30 days. Median age varied from 45 years (interquartile range (IQR) 31-57) among community-managed cases to 82 years (IQR 75-89) among those who died. Age was a strong predictor of fatal disease (odds ratio (OR) 14 for 70-79-year old, OR 26 for 80-89-year old, and OR 82 for cases older than 90 years, when compared to 50-59-year old and adjusted for sex and number of comorbidities). Similarly, the number of comorbidities was strongly associated with fatal disease (OR 5.2, for cases with [&ge;]4 comorbidities versus no comorbidities), and 82% of fatal cases had at least 2 comorbidities. A wide range of major chronic diseases were associated with hospitalization with ORs ranging from 1.3-1.4 (e.g. stroke, ischemic heart disease) to 2.2-2.7 (e.g. heart failure, hospital-diagnosed kidney disease, chronic liver disease). Similarly, chronic diseases were associated with mortality with ORs ranging from 1.2-1.3 (e.g. ischemic heart disease, hypertension) to 2.4-2.7 (e.g. major psychiatric disorder, organ transplantation). In the absence of comorbidities, mortality was relatively low (5% or less) in persons aged up to 80 years. Conclusions and Relevance In this first nationwide population-based study, increasing age and number of comorbidities were strongly associated with hospitalization requirement and death in COVID-19. In the absence of comorbidities, the mortality was, however, lowest until the age of 80 years. These results may help in accurate identification, triage and protection of high-risk groups in general populations, i.e. when reopening societies.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mette Reilev","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kasper Bruun Kristensen","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anton Pottegaard","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lars Christian Lund","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jesper Hallas","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Martin Thomsen Ernst","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christian Fynbo Christiansen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Henrik Toft Soerensen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nanna Borup Johansen","author_inst":"Danish Medicines Agency"},{"author_name":"Nikolai Constantin Brun","author_inst":"Danish Medicines Agency"},{"author_name":"Marianne Voldstedlund","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Henrik Stoevring","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Marianne Kragh Thomsen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steffen Christensen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gubbels","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Tyra Grove Krause","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Kaare Moelbak","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Reimar Wernich Thomsen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20110338","rel_title":"Spurious Correlation?

We show here that we can improve this prediction using a non linear model z' = b-a z^r where r is an exponent that we have also to estimate from data. Some countries have an epidemic with a bell shaped form that we call unimodal epidemic. With this new model, we fit observed data of different countries having an unimodal epidemic with a surprising quality. We discuss also the prediction quality obtained with these models at the epidemic start in France.

Spain has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective. To create a registry of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain in order to improve our knowledge of the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of this disease. Methods. A multicentre retrospective cohort study, including consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 throughout Spain. Epidemiological and clinical data, additional tests at admission and at seven days, treatments administered, and progress at 30 days of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Results. Up to April 30th 2020, 6,424 patients from 109 hospitals were included. Their median age was 69.1 years (range: 18-102 years) and 56.9% were male. Prevalences of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were 50.2%, 39.7%, and 18.7%, respectively. The most frequent symptoms were fever (86.2%) and cough (76.5%). High values of ferritin (72.4%), lactate dehydrogenase (70.2%), and D-dimer (61.5%), as well as lymphopenia (52.6%), were frequent. The most used antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine (85.7%) and lopinavir\/ritonavir (62.4%). 31.5% developed respiratory distress. Overall mortality rate was 21.1%, with a marked increase with age (50-59 years: 4.2%, 60-69 years: 9.1%, 70-79 years: 21.4%, 80-89 years: 42.5%, [&ge;] 90 years: 51.1%). Conclusions. The SEMI-COVID-19 Network provides data on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain are mostly severe cases, as one in three patients developed respiratory distress and one in five patients died. These findings confirm a close relationship between advanced age and mortality.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Casas Rojo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla (Madrid), Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Miguel Ant\u00f3n Santos","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla (Madrid), Spain"},{"author_name":"Jes\u00fas Mill\u00e1n N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cort\u00e9s","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Lumbreras Bermejo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, 12 de Octubre University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ramos Rinc\u00f3n","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, General University Hospital of Alicante, Alicante Institute for Health and Biomedical Research (ISABIAL), Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez de Elch"},{"author_name":"Emilia Roy-Vallejo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, La Princesa University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arturo Artero Mora","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

Precise knowledge of population immunity could allow government bodies to make informed decisions about how and when to relax stay-at-home directives and to reopen the economy. We hypothesized that salivary antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could serve as a non-invasive alternative to serological testing for widespread monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the population. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology and tested 167 saliva and 324 serum samples, including 134 and 118 negative saliva and serum samples, respectively, collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 33 saliva and 206 serum samples from participants with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated the correlation of results obtained in saliva vs. serum and determined the sensitivity and specificity for each diagnostic media, stratified by antibody isotype, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on COVID-19 case designation for all specimens. Matched serum and saliva SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific IgG responses were significantly correlated. Within the 10-plex SARS-CoV-2 panel, the salivary anti-nucleocapsid (N) protein IgG response resulted in the highest sensitivity for detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (100% sensitivity at [&ge;]10 days post-SARS-CoV-2 symptom onset). The salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response resulted in 100% specificity. Among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with RT-PCR, the temporal kinetics of IgG, IgA, and IgM in saliva were consistent with those observed in serum. SARS-CoV-2 appears to trigger a humoral immune response resulting in the almost simultaneous rise of IgG, IgM and IgA levels both in serum and in saliva, mirroring responses consistent with the stimulation of existing, cross-reactive B cells. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in saliva can play a critically important role in large-scale 'sero'-surveillance to address key public health priorities and guide policy and decision-making for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pranay R Randad","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nora Pisanic","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kate Kruczynski","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yukari C Manabe","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Thomas","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pekosz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public  Health"},{"author_name":"Sabra Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael J Betenbaugh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"William A Clarke","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrizio P Caturegli","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"H Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Barbara Detrick","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jessica K Fairley","author_inst":"Hubert Department of Global Health, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amy C Sherman","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nadine Rouphael","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Srilatha Edupuganti","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Douglas A Granger","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience Research, University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Steve W Granger","author_inst":"Salimetrics, LLC"},{"author_name":"Matthew Collins","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Heaney","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rabad\u00e1n Pejenaute","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

This study aimed to detect risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Our cohort were all consecutive adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at a secondary hospital in Madrid, March 3-16, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data came from electronic clinical records and were compared between survivors and non-survivors, with outcomes followed up until April 4. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods allowed us to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: The cohort comprised 562 patients with COVID-19. Clinical records were available for evaluation for 392 patients attended at the emergency department of our hospital, of whom 199 were discharged, 85 remained hospitalized and 108 died during hospitalization. Among 311 of the hospitalized patients, 34.7% died. Of the 392 patients with records, the median age was 71.5 years (50.6-80.7); 52.6% were men. 252 (64.3%) patients had a comorbidity, hypertension being the most common: 175 (44.6%), followed by other cardiovascular disease: 102 (26.0%) and diabetes: 97 (24.7%). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age over 65 (odds ratio 8.32, 95% CI 3.01-22.96; p<0.001), coronary heart disease (2.76, 1.44-5.30; 0.002), and both lower lymphocyte count (0.34, 0.17-0.68; 0.002) and higher LDH (1.25, 1.05-1.50; 0.012) per 1-unit increase and per 100 units respectively. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 was associated in our hospital at the peak of the pandemic with a crude mortality ratio of 19.2% and a mortality ratio of 34.7% in admitted patients, considerably above most of the ratios described in the Chinese series. These results leave open the question as to which factors, epidemiological or intrinsically viral, apart from age and comorbidities, can explain this difference in excess mortality.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of various treatment modalities in nCOV-2019 patients. Methods: An extensive literature search was conducted before 22 May 2020 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane library databases. Quality assessment was performed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale. A fixed-effect model was applied if I2 <50%, else the results were combined using random-effect model. Risk Ratio (RR) or Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) along-with 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) were used to pool the results. Between study heterogeneity was explored using influence and sensitivity analyses & publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. Results: Eighty-one studies involving 44 in vitro and 37 clinical studies including 8662 nCOV-2019 patients were included in the review. Lopinavir-Ritonavir compared to controls was significantly associated with shorter mean time to clinical improvement (SMD -0.32; 95%CI -0.57 to -0.06) and Remdesivir compared to placebo was significantly associated with better overall clinical improvement (RR 1.17; 95%CI 1.07 to 1.29). Hydroxychloroquine was associated with less overall clinical improvement (RR 0.88; 95%CI 0.79 to 0.98) and longer time to clinical improvement (SMD 0.64; 95%CI 0.33 to 0.94). It additionally had higher all-cause mortality (RR 1.6; 95%CI 1.26 to 2.03) and more total adverse events (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.58 to 2.13). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that except in vitro studies, no treatment till now has shown clear-cut benefit on nCOV-2019 patients. Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Remdesivir have shown some benefits in terms less time to clinical improvement and better overall clinical improvement. Hydroxychloroquine use has a risk of higher mortality and adverse events.

There are no previous studies of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated nasal and oral antiseptic formulations of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) for virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report on the efficacy of PVP-I against the virus that causes COVID-19. Methods: PVP-I nasal antiseptic formulations and PVP-I oral rinse antiseptic formulations from 1-5% concentrations as well as controls were studied for virucidal efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Test compounds were evaluated for ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as measured in a virucidal assay. SARS-CoV-2 was exposed directly to the test compound for 60 seconds, compounds were then neutralized and surviving virus was quantified. Results: All concentrations of nasal antiseptics and oral rinse antiseptics evaluated completely inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Conclusions: Nasal and oral PVP-I antiseptic solutions are effective at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus at a variety of concentrations after 60s exposure times. The formulations tested may help to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 if used for nasal decontamination, oral decontamination or surface decontamination in known or suspected cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesse Pelletier","author_inst":"Ocean Ophthalmology Group (Miami, FL)"},{"author_name":"Belachew Tessema","author_inst":"ProHealth Physicians Ear, Nose and Throat (Farmington, CT),  University of Connecticut, Department of Otolaryngology (Farmington, CT)"},{"author_name":"Jonna Westover","author_inst":"The Institute for Antiviral Research at Utah State University (Logan, UT)"},{"author_name":"Samantha Frank","author_inst":"University of Connecticut, Department of Otolaryngology (Farmington, CT)"},{"author_name":"Seth Brown","author_inst":"University of Connecticut, Department of Otolaryngology (Farmington, CT) ,  The Institute for Antiviral Research at Utah State University (Logan, UT)"},{"author_name":"Joseph Capriotti","author_inst":"Veloce BioPharma (Fort Lauderdale, FL)"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Lledo Garcia","author_inst":"Universidad de Alcala de Henares"},{"author_name":"Cristina Verdu Exposito","author_inst":"Universidad de Alcala de Henares"},{"author_name":"Jose Sanz Moreno","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Isabel Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Abel Uribe Mathews","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Esther Lopez Ramos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Lara Maceda Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Daniel Troncoso","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Juan Cuadros","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Nadine Rouphael","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Srilatha Edupuganti","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Douglas A Granger","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience Research, University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Steve W Granger","author_inst":"Salimetrics, LLC"},{"author_name":"Matthew Collins","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Heaney","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rabad\u00e1n Pejenaute","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

Design: We performed a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Setting: A University hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March 2020. Participants: Patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Exposures: Patients treated with steroids were compared to patients not treated with steroids. A propensity-score for steroid treatment was developed. Different steroid regimens were also compared, and adjusted with a second propensity score. Main Outcomes and Measures: To determine the role of steroids in in-hospital mortality, univariable and multivariable analyses were performed, and adjusted including the propensity score as a covariate. Survival times were compared using a log-rank test. Results: During the study period, 463 out of 848 hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 396 (46.7%) consecutive patients were treated with steroids and 67 patients were assigned to the control cohort. Global mortality was 15.1%. Median time to steroid treatment from symptom onset was 10 days (IQR 8 to13). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55\/396] versus 23.9% [16\/67], OR 0.51 [0.27 to 0.96], p= 0.044). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 41.8% relative to no steroid treatment (RRR 0,42 [0.048 to 0.65). Initial treatment with 1 mg\/kg\/day of methylprednisolone (or equivalent) versus steroid pulses was not associated with in-hospital mortality (13.5% [42\/310] versus 15.1% [13\/86], OR 0.880 [0.449-1.726], p=0.710). Conclusions: Our results show that survival of patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia is higher in patients treated with glucocorticoids than in those not treated. In-hospital mortality was not different between initial regimens of 1 mg\/kg\/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent and glucocorticoid pulses. These results support the use of glucocorticoids in SARS-CoV2 infection.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Fernandez-Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Belen Ruiz-Antoran","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Ana Munoz-Gomez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Aranzazu Sancho-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Patricia Mills-Sanchez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Adolfo Centeno-Soto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Silvia Blanco-Alonso","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Laura Javaloyes-Garachana","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Amy Galan-Gomez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Angela Valencia-Alijo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Javier Gomez-Irusta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Concepcion Payares-Herrera","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Morras-Torre","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Enrique Sanchez-Chica","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Laura Delgado-Tellez-de-Cepeda","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Callejas-Diaz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Ramos-Martinez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Munez-Rubio","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Cristina Avendano-Sola","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Matthew Collins","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Heaney","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rabad\u00e1n Pejenaute","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

Design: Prospective cross-sectional observational study. Setting: An acute NHS healthcare provider. Participants: All inpatient wards were fully occupied by patients with COVID-19 at the time of sampling. Interventions: Air and surface samples were collected from a range of clinical areas and a public area of the hospital. An active air sampler was used to collect three or four 1.0 m3 air samples in each area. Surface samples were collected by swabbing approximately 25 cm2 of items in the immediate vicinity of each air sample. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-qPCR and viral culture using Vero E6 and Caco2 cells; additionally the limit of detection for culturing SARS-CoV-2 dried onto surfaces was determined. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 detected by PCR or culture. Results: Viral RNA was detected on 114\/218 (52.3%) of surface and 14\/31 (38.7%) air samples but no virus was cultured. The proportion of surface samples contaminated with viral RNA varied by item sampled and by clinical area. Viral RNA was detected on surfaces and in air in public areas of the hospital but was more likely to be found in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients (67\/105 (63.8%) in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients vs. 29\/64 (45.3%) in other areas (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.9, p=0.025, Fishers exact test). The PCR Ct value for all surface and air samples (>30) indicated a viral load that would not be culturable. Conclusions: Our findings of extensive viral RNA contamination of surfaces and air across a range of acute healthcare settings in the absence of cultured virus underlines the potential risk from surface and air contamination in managing COVID-19, and the need for effective use of PPE, social distancing, and hand\/surface hygiene.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Otter","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Richard Price","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Cristina Cimpeanu","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Danel Meno Garcia","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Piers Boshier","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Frances Bolt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alison H Holmes","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barklay","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Concepcion Payares-Herrera","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Morras-Torre","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Enrique Sanchez-Chica","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Laura Delgado-Tellez-de-Cepeda","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Callejas-Diaz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Ramos-Martinez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Munez-Rubio","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Cristina Avendano-Sola","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"},{"author_name":"Matthew Collins","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Heaney","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rabad\u00e1n Pejenaute","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

Alternative do-it-yourself respirators (ADR) emerge, without any proof of protection. Objective Verify seal potential of two ADR compared to a common FFP2 respirator. Design Quality assessment pilot study. Setting Tertiary Care Hospital. Participants Ten anaesthesiology residents. Interventions Participants performed quantitative face-fit tests (QNFT) with three respirators to evaluate seal. A common FFP2 respirator was used as baseline (control group). ADR tested in this study are an Anaesthesia Face Mask (AFM) and a full-face Modified Snorkelling Mask (MSM) with a 3D-printed connector, both in conjunction with a breathing system filter. Main outcome measures Non-inferior seal performance of ADR over FFP2, assessed by calculated QNFT based on measured individual fit factors, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Results For each respirator a total of 90 individual fit factor measurements were taken. Within the control group, seal failed in 37 (41%) measurements but only in 10 (11%) within the AFM group and in 6 (7%) within the MSM group (P < 0.001 respectively). However, when calculating the final, mean QNFT results, no statistically significant difference was found between respirators. Successful QNFT were determined for 5 out of 10 participants in the control group, for 8 in the AFM group (P = 0.25) and for 7 in the MSM group (P = 0.69). Conclusion Both ADR do have the potential to provide non inferior seal compared to a common FFP2 respirator. While AFM respirators are easily assembled, snorkelling masks must undergo significant but feasible modifications. Our results suggest that those ADR masks might be further investigated as they seem to be viable alternatives for situations when certified respirators are not available.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Pettinger","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Mona Momeni","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Clemence Michaud","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Michel Van Dyck","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"David Kahn","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Lemaire","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Le Nguyen Truc Nhuc","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Han Ny","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Ngo Ngoc Quang Minh","author_inst":"CH1"},{"author_name":"Dinh Nguyen Huy Man","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Vu Thi Ty Hang","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Phan Nguyen Quoc Khanh","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Tran Chan Xuan","author_inst":"Cu Chi Hospital, HCMC"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Phong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

Enteritidis) were placed inside an ambulance at two different locations. The interior of the vehicle was subjected to 10 min and 20 min treatments (3 and 6 times the recommended time by the manufacturer). Following the treatments, lentivector preparations were titrated, and viable bacteria (colony forming units, CFUs) counted and compared to pre-treatment titers and infectious CFUs of the same lysates and cultures. Results: None of the treatments significantly reduced either lentivector titer or the number of viable bacteria. Conclusions: At least in the analyzed conditions and for the microorganisms used in this study, it can be concluded that ozone treatment is not advisable for the disinfection of emergency vehicles.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Biurrun","author_inst":"Subdireccion de Urgencias de Navarra y Direccion Tecnica de la atencion a la Urgencia Vital"},{"author_name":"Begona Garcia","author_inst":"Navarrabiomed"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perez","author_inst":"Navarrabiomed"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Kochan","author_inst":"Navarrabiomed"},{"author_name":"David Escors","author_inst":"Navarrabiomed"},{"author_name":"Jose Crespo","author_inst":"Subdireccion de Urgencias de Navarra y Direccion Tecnica de la atencion a la Urgencia Vital"},{"author_name":"Inigo Lasa","author_inst":"Navarrabiomed"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Echarri","author_inst":"Subdireccion de Urgencias de Navarra y Direccion Tecnica de la atencion a la Urgencia Vital."},{"author_name":"Ngo Ngoc Quang Minh","author_inst":"CH1"},{"author_name":"Dinh Nguyen Huy Man","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Vu Thi Ty Hang","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Phan Nguyen Quoc Khanh","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Tran Chan Xuan","author_inst":"Cu Chi Hospital, HCMC"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Phong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many studies suggested that genetic variants in ACE2 gene may influence the host susceptibility\/resistance to SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the functional role of ACE2 in human pathophysiology. However, all these studies have been conducted in silico based on epidemiological and population data. We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in a cohort of 99 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) to experimental demonstrate allelic association with disease severity. Methods: By whole-exome sequencing we analysed 99 DNA samples of severely and extremely severely COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata and Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome. Results: We identified three different germline variants, one intronic (c.439+4G>A) and two missense (c.2158A>G, p.Asn720Asp; c.1888G>C, p.Asp630His ), in 26 patients with a similar frequency between male and female and a not statistically different frequency, except for c.1888G>C, (p.Asp630His) with the ethnically matched populations (EUR). Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is not any ACE2 exonic allelic association with disease severity. It is possible that rare susceptibility alleles are located in the non-coding region of the gene able to control ACE2 gene activity. It is therefore of interest, to explore the existence of ACE2 susceptibility alleles to SARS-Co-V2 in these regulatory regions. In addition, we found no significant evidence that ACE2 alleles is associated with disease severity\/sex bias in the Italian population.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Novelli","author_inst":"Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michela Biancolella","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Borgiani","author_inst":"Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University of Rome, 00133 Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cocciadiferro","author_inst":"Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vito Luigi Colona","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Laboratory, Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria D'Apice","author_inst":"Medical Genetics Laboratory, Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Rogliani","author_inst":"Unit of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Zaffina","author_inst":"Occupational Medicine, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Leonardis","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Tor Vergata University Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Raponi","author_inst":"Medical Directorate, IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sandro Grelli","author_inst":"Dept. of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Novelli","author_inst":"Tor Vergata University"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Truong","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"HTD"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rubio-Rivas","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.
