Objective: Describe the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 in Jingmen,Hubei,introduce the local prevention and control experience,and observe the impact of various prevention and control measures on the number of new cases. Methods: All the COVID-19 patients diagnosed in the municipal districts of Jingmen from January 12 to February 29,2020 were enrolled in this study. We described epidemiological data and observed the impact of control measures on the epidemic. Findings: Of the 219 cases (110 men and 109 women), 88 (40%) had exposure to Wuhan. The median age was 48 years ( range,2-88 years;IQR,35-60). Thirty-three severe patients with a median age of 66 years(range,33-82 years,IQR,57-76) were treated in intensive care units; out of these patients, 66.7 %(22) were men and 19 (57.5%) had chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Under the control measures, the number of new patients gradually decreased and nearly disappeared after 18 days. Wearing masks in all kinds of situations prevents most infections and is one of the most effective prevention and control measures. Interpretation: In conclusion,all people are susceptible to COVID-19, and older males and those with comorbid conditions are more likely to become severe cases. Even though COVID-19 is highly contagious,control measures have proven to be very effective, particularly wearing masks,which could prevent most infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qijun Gao","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"yingfu hu","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"zhiguo dai Sr.","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"Jing wu","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"Feng Xiao","author_inst":"the first hostial of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"Jing wang","author_inst":"the fisrt hospital ofJingmen"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Natalie Thornburg","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Susan Gerber","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lloyd-Smith","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.08.20031229","rel_title":"Mortality of COVID-19 is Associated with Cellular Immune Function Compared to Immune Function in Chinese Han Population","rel_date":"2020-03-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.08.20031229","rel_abs":"In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China.

However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qin Jing","author_inst":"Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute  of Health"},{"author_name":"Chong You","author_inst":"Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qiushi Lin","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Taojun Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Yu","author_inst":"Office for Epidemiology, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-yong Dong","author_inst":"The Second Medical Center & National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xing-huan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Allan Gopez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Steven Miller","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chao-Yang Pan","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hugo Guevara","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janice Chen","author_inst":"Mammoth Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.07.20032573","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics of 2019 Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19): An Updated Systematic Review","rel_date":"2020-03-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.07.20032573","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Kun Wen","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Chao Han","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Chen","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuxian Pan","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen  Bioeasy  Biotechnology  Co.

Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Department of Spinal Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Guo-Dong Sun","author_inst":"Department of Spinal Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Zhong Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Xiang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chuan Sun","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ye Yuan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Chen","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuxian Pan","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen  Bioeasy  Biotechnology  Co.

While distinct from SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization, origins to bat CoVs, and an arsenal of immune antagonists. In this report, we evaluate type-I interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication to SARS-CoV, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I. In Vero and in Calu3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 is substantially attenuated in the context of IFN-I pretreatment, while SARS-CoV is not. In line with these findings, SARS-CoV-2 fails to counteract phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of ISG proteins, while SARS-CoV is able to suppress both. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC), we observe the absence of IFN-I stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 alone, but detect failure to counteract STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN-I pretreatment resulting in near ablation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we evaluated IFN-I treatment post infection and found SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive even after establishing infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonists. The absence of an equivalent open reading frame (ORF) 3b and changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN-I antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to IFN-I responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that may help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.\n\nImportanceWith the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options.

Methods: Articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google up-to 24 February 2020 were systematically reviewed. Eighteen Literatures were identified with cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed. Results: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion\/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea\/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea\/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea\/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. Conclusions: Fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea\/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weiping Ji","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Gautam Bishnu","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xudong Du","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Chen","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Hui Xu","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Guo","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhai Cai","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xian Shen","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janice Chen","author_inst":"Mammoth Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20031971","rel_title":"Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs","rel_date":"2020-03-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20031971","rel_abs":"The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases.

SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chang Ha Woo","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sungho Jang","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Giyoung Shin","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gyoo Yeol Jung","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jeong Wook Lee","author_inst":"Pohang University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Xu","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Guo","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhai Cai","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Xian Shen","author_inst":"wenzhou medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janice Chen","author_inst":"Mammoth Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.07.981928","rel_title":"Substrate specificity profiling of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease provides basis for anti-COVID-19 drug design","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.07.981928","rel_abs":"In December 2019, the first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); therefore, research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. On the basis of these findings, we designed and synthesized an inhibitor and two activity-based probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Using this approach we visualized SARS-CoV-2 active Mpro within nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of a patient with active COVID-19 infection. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wioletta Rut","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Groborz","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Linlin Zhang","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Xinyuanyuan Sun","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Zmudzinski","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bartlomiej Pawlik","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Mlynarski","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Rolf Hilgenfeld","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcin Drag","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janice Chen","author_inst":"Mammoth Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20032144","rel_title":"CORONAVIRUS IN PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY: RAPID REVIEW AND EXPERT CONSENSUS","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20032144","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Mullins","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"RCPCH"},{"author_name":"Russell Viner","author_inst":"RCPCH"},{"author_name":"Patrick O'Brien","author_inst":"RCOG"},{"author_name":"Eddie Morris","author_inst":"RCOG"},{"author_name":"Bartlomiej Pawlik","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Mlynarski","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz"},{"author_name":"Rolf Hilgenfeld","author_inst":"University of Luebeck"},{"author_name":"Marcin Drag","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Diagnosis Chongqing Public Health Medical Center Public Health Hospital of Southwest University Chongqing, People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases Southwest Hospital,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Gua"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People's Republic of China"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janice Chen","author_inst":"Mammoth Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20032011","rel_title":"Amplicon based MinION sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic characterisation of nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20032011","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a complex disease phenotype where the underlying microbiome could influence morbidity and mortality.

Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P < 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on. CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cong-Ying Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jia Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jian-Qin He","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Qiang Lu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Steven T Pullan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel Carter","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhao","author_inst":"Northwest A&F University"},{"author_name":"Yani Sun","author_inst":"Northwest A&F University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Hartley","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"En-min Zhou","author_inst":"Northwest A&F University"},{"author_name":"Tom Solomon","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael B.

This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1{+\/-}3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. Conclusions: The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Xia","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and

crucial for evaluating its spread pattern, especially in metropolitan areas of China, as its spread can lead to secondary outbreaks outside Wuhan, the center of the new coronavirus disease outbreak. In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and ~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Longxiang Su","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Na Hong","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal ([&le;]49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety ([&ge;]70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact ({beta}value=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). Similar things were observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China ({beta}value=3.67, CI: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases ({beta}value=4.44, CI: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). Conclusion: Our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenyun Liu","author_inst":"People 's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Yun-zhi Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan district"},{"author_name":"Xiao Ming Zhang","author_inst":"people's hospital of shenzhen baoan district"},{"author_name":"Xinying Xu","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan district"},{"author_name":"Qing-Li Dou","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan districtP"},{"author_name":"Wen-Wu Zhang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Lin Han","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Barbara Oliveiros","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra"},{"author_name":"Liliana Caramelo","author_inst":"Centre for the Research and Technology of Agro-Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Nuno C Ferreira","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra"},{"author_name":"Francisco Caramelo","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Qing-Li Dou","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan districtP"},{"author_name":"Wen-Wu Zhang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Lin Han","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.

Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of \"the more fear, the more problem-focused coping\". And people may \"The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping\", \"the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness\". Conclusion: COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of psychological crisis, and those nurses at the core of the incident are affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and providing timely psychological assistance and training in coping strategies. Improving nurses' ability to regulate emotions and effective coping strategies, providing a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Long Huang","author_inst":"Jiangxi normal university"},{"author_name":"Fu ming xu","author_inst":"Nanning normal university"},{"author_name":"Hai rong Liu","author_inst":"Wannan medical college"},{"author_name":"Francisco Caramelo","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Qing-Li Dou","author_inst":"People's hospital of shenzhen baoan districtP"},{"author_name":"Wen-Wu Zhang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District"},{"author_name":"Lin Han","author_inst":"Digital China Health Technologies Co.
