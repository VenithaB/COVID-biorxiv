Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible, and broader mitigation measures must be implemented. Methods: To estimate the comparative efficacy of these case-based interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit to the incubation period distribution and each of two sets of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4.8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7.5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we consider two feasibility settings: a high feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and low feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a two-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation. Findings: Our results suggest that individual quarantine in high feasibility settings where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined contains an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. When resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. Interpretation: Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts. To the extent these interventions can be implemented they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Corey M Peak","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roman Woelfel","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Guggemos","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Seilmaier","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sabine Zange","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Vollmar","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Camilla Rothe","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bleicker","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Bruenink","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Julia Schneider","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rosina Ehmann","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katrin Zwirglmaier","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Wendtner","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20031856","rel_title":"A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 admitted hospital patients","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20031856","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge for public health laboratories. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and\/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127\/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67\/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. Keywords.

Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Hernandez","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Milechin","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Shakti K Davis","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rich DeLaura","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kajal T Claypool","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Albert Swiston","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Vollmar","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Camilla Rothe","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bleicker","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Bruenink","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Julia Schneider","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rosina Ehmann","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katrin Zwirglmaier","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Wendtner","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20031773","rel_title":"Estimating the infection and case fatality ratio for COVID-19 using age-adjusted data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20031773","rel_abs":"Adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-death, we estimated case and infection fatality ratios (CFR, IFR) for COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess ship as 1.2% (0.38-2.7%) and 2.3% (0.75%-5.3%).

The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Coronavirus has a history of causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 [A]. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which will facilitate to vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zied Bouslama","author_inst":"Laboratory of veterinary epidemiology and microbiology LR16IPT03.

By using genomic, sequence, structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongjun Tan","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Theresa Schneider","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Leong","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"L Aravind","author_inst":"NCBI, NLM, NIH"},{"author_name":"Dapeng Zhang","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Kais Ghedira","author_inst":"Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Biomathematics and Biostatistics - LR16IPT09, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia."},{"author_name":"Najet-Srairi Abid","author_inst":"Universite de Tunis El Manar, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LR11IPT08 Venins et Biomolecules Therapeutiques, 1002, Tunis, Tunisia."},{"author_name":"Scott Hazelhurst","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences and School of Electrical and Information Engineering,  University of the Witwaters"},{"author_name":"Thomas Tran","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jason Roberts","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nichollas Scott","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mike Catton","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Lachlan Coin","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Duchene","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Wendtner","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.979260","rel_title":"LY6E impairs coronavirus fusion and confers immune control of viral disease","rel_date":"2020-03-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.979260","rel_abs":"Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie Pfaender","author_inst":"Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Katrina B Mar","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Annika Kratzel","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Dagny Hirt","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wenchun Fan","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kleine-Weber","author_inst":"University Gottingen"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"Deutsches Primatenzentrum GmbH"},{"author_name":"H.

While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vanessa M.

Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, compared with the coronavirus carried by pangolins (Pangolin-CoV), the virus carried by bats (bat-RaTG13-CoV) has a closer relationship with SARS-CoV-2.

Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients. The cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2C.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ge Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiarong Xie","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangli Dai","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peijun Zheng","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaqing Hu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongpeng Lu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tao Pan","author_inst":"Anhui Province Key Laboratory for Conservation and Exploitation of Biological Resource, College of Life Sciences, Anhui Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yilin Shu","author_inst":"Anhui Province Key Laboratory for Conservation and Exploitation of Biological Resource, College of Life Sciences, Anhui Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yongzhong Jiang","author_inst":"Influenza Reference Laboratory, Institute of Health Inspection and Testing, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shoudeng Chen","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mary Wight-Carter","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Natasha W Hanners","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stefan Pohlmann","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Tom Gallagher","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Daniel Todt","author_inst":"Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Gert Zimmer","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Charles M Rice","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"John W Schoggins","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"University of Bern"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20031005","rel_title":"Case fatality risk of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in China","rel_date":"2020-03-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.20031005","rel_abs":"Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36\/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiling Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxin Zhou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yinzi Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Han Yan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yongli Zhang","author_inst":"Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Gong","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xianglin Wei","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 nonsurvivors and analyze possible causes for the rapid disease progress to death. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were identified. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data from electronic medical records. Results Among 101 nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0), 59.4% were male, 79.2% had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4%), cardiovascular disease (22.8%), diabetes (20.8%) etc. The most common symptoms were fever (76.2%), cough (58.4%) and dyspnea (54.5%). Respiratory failure (99.0%), acute cardiac injury (52.5%), sepsis (40.6%) and acute kidney injury (23.8%) were most common complications. Compared with patients died after 3 days of admission, patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6.7*109\/L, P=0.001) and neutrophil count (8.9 vs 5.5*109\/L, P=0.001), longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040), higher D-dimer concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040), higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol\/L, P=0.042), lower oxygen saturation (85.0% vs 91.0%, P=0.008), and were more likely to suffer sepsis (52.1% vs 30.2%, P=0.025). Conclusions Older patients with underlying comorbidities suffering COVID-19 were at high risk of death. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of COVID-19 patients. Early development of sepsis was associated with the rapid disease progress to death.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiao Shi","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kailiang Zhao","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jia Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Jiang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Feng","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kaiping Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yupu Hong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Man Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Weixing Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xianglin Wei","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen, immune cell markers (CD8, CD68 and CD56) and the complement C5b-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the viral particles in kidneys were also investigated by transmission electronic microscope (EM). RESULTS 27.06% (23\/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively). H&E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. EM observation also demonstrated that viruses- like particles are visible in the kidneys. Viral infection not only induces CD68+ macrophages infiltrated into tubulointerstitium, but also enhances complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients. Viruses directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. The viruses not only have direct cytotoxicity, but also initiate CD68+ macrophage together with complement C5b-9 deposition to mediate tubular pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,   China"},{"author_name":"Chenhui Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Rongshuai Wang","author_inst":"Hubei Chongxin Judicial Expertise Center, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zeqing Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yingjun Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Huiming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province,China"},{"author_name":"Changsong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, 989th Hospital of PLA, Luoyang, Henan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Liu","author_inst":"Hubei Chongxin Judicial Expertise Center, Wuhan, Hubei province,  China"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,  China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,  China"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Ren","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Tang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Danyan Xu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jia He","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Tang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shi Tai","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhi Wu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Ren","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

Methods Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Results Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24).

As of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential to understand clinical prognosis, plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting. The case fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most commonly reported metric, but can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The objectives of this study were to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR) and the infection fatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed- infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province, China and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Wuerttemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 2.1-2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2-4.2%) and IFR 2.9% (2.4-3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1-1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among 80+ year olds, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI: 16-26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI: 28-40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required and these are not available in all countries. Conclusions. We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony Hauser","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Michel J Counotte","author_inst":"ISPM University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Charles C Margossian","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Garyfallos Konstantinoudis","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern, Federal Office of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jia He","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Tang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shi Tai","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhi Wu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Ren","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhou Tang","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xianbin Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Houqiang Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"aizhen Pan","author_inst":"The First People  Hospital of Foshan"},{"author_name":"qian yu li","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical"},{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern, Federal Office of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jia He","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Tang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shi Tai","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhi Wu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Ren","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.
