This differs from the case-fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic. While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy-makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19. Methods Pubmed, Medline, SSRN, and Medrxiv were searched using a set of terms and Boolean operators on 25\/04\/2020 and re-searched 14\/05\/2020, 21\/05\/2020, and 16\/06\/2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by both authors. Meta-analysis was performed in Stata 15.1 using the metan command, based on IFR and confidence intervals extracted from each study. Google\/Google Scholar was used to assess the grey literature relating to government reports. Results After exclusions, there were 26 estimates of IFR included in the final meta-analysis, from a wide range of countries, published between February and June 2020. The meta-analysis demonstrated a point-estimate of IFR of 0.68% (0.53-0.82%) with high heterogeneity (p<0.001). Conclusion Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence on COVID-19 until May, 2020, the IFR of the disease across populations is 0.68% (0.53-0.82%). However, due to very high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to know if this represents the true point estimate. It is likely that, due to age and perhaps underlying comorbidities in the population, different places will experience different IFRs due to the disease. Given issues with mortality recording, it is also likely that this represents an underestimate of the true IFR figure. More research looking at age-stratified IFR is urgently needed to inform policy-making on this front.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Lea Merone","author_inst":"James Cook University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20080879","rel_title":"Validation of a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological Immunoassay","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20080879","rel_abs":"Aims: To validate the diagnostic accuracy of a Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA immunoassay for COVID-19 disease. Methods: In this unmatched (1:1) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 176 negative controls collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% of them were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had a high diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.992 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.986-0.996) and 0.977 (95%CI: 0.963-0.990), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.008). Considering optimized cut-offs taking the 15% inter-assay imprecision assessed into account, an IgG ratio cut-off > 1.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 98-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 97-100). A 0.5 cut-off displayed a 97% sensitivity (95%CI: 93-99) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 93-99). Adopting these thresholds, rather than those of the manufacturer, improved assay performance, leaving 12% of IgG ratios ranging between 0.5-1.5 as indeterminate. Conclusions: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in a samples of patients, without any obvious gains from considering IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not in our study population. They should however not be considered as a surrogate of protection at this stage.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Giulia Torriani","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Sabine Yerly","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lena Mazza","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Adrien Calame","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Arm-Vernez","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Gert Zimmer","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Thomas Agoritsas","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Stirnemann","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Herve Spechbach","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Pugin","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Pascale Roux-Lombard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lionel Fontao","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Claire-Anne Siegrist","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088484","rel_title":"Effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Maternal, Perinatal and Neonatal Outcomes: a Systematic Review of 266 Pregnancies","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088484","rel_abs":"Objective: To perform a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19 to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until April 20, 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after April 20, 2020). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and\/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient was pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied. Results: We identified several case-reports and case-series but only 19 studies, including a total of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met eligibility criteria and were finally included in the review. In the combined data from seven case-series, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea\/shortness of breath and fatigue. The rate of severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of the cases requiring intensive care unit admission. Almost all cases from the case-series had positive computer tomography chest findings. There were six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only a few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion. 177 cases had delivered, of which the majority by Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight less than 2500 grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. There were 113 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, which was negative for SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe pneumonia, in comparison to nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. Most importantly, in order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Juan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Maria M Gil","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Hospital Universitario de Torrejon, Torrejon de Ardoz, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Zhihui Rong","author_inst":"Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuanzhen Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Clinical Medicine Research Center of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth"},{"author_name":"Huixia Yang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Liona Chiu Yee Poon","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,  Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gert Zimmer","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Thomas Agoritsas","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Stirnemann","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Herve Spechbach","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jerome Pugin","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Pascale Roux-Lombard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lionel Fontao","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Claire-Anne Siegrist","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"obstetrics and gynecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20070581","rel_title":"Psychophysical Olfactory Findings of Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 Patients: Preliminary Report.","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20070581","rel_abs":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 infection, many patients reported sudden loss of smell (SLS).

We sought to evaluate the utilization and diagnostic yield of blood cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine prevalence and common etiologies of bacteremia, and to inform a diagnostic approach to relieve blood culture overutilization. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19. Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the first half of the month. The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than COVID-19 negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%), p < 0.001.  COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, reducing the bacteremia rate to 1.6% when excluded.  More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation. Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial co-infection. Clear communication with ordering providers is necessary to prevent overutilization of blood cultures during COVID-19 surges, and laboratories should consider shortening the incubation period from 5 days to 4 days to free additional capacity.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Sepulveda","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lars F Westblade","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Susan Whittier","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Joseph Satlin","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"William Greendyke","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Justin G Aaron","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jason E.

Few studies have compared these clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 to other acute respiratory illnesses. Methods: We examined all patients presenting to an emergency department in San Francisco, California between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results including viral diagnostics using PCR and mNGS. Among those hospitalized, we determined differences in treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, respiratory support) and outcomes (ICU admission, ICU interventions, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury). Findings: In a cohort of 316 patients, 33 (10%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 patients, all without COVID-19, tested positive for another respiratory virus (16%). Among patients with additional viral testing, no co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified by PCR or mNGS. Patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7 vs. 3 days), and were more likely to report fever (82% vs. 44%), fatigue (85% vs. 50%), and myalgias (61% vs 27%); p<0.001 for all comparisons. Lymphopenia (55% vs 34%, p=0.018) and bilateral opacities on initial chest radiograph (55% vs. 24%, p=0.001) were more common in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79% vs. 56%, p=0.014). Of 186 hospitalized patients, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p<0.001) and were more likely to develop ARDS (23% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Most comorbidities, home medications, signs and symptoms, vital signs, laboratory results, treatment, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses.","rel_num_authors":46,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sachin J Shah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Peter N Barish","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Priya A Prasad","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amy L Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Norma Neff","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Lucy M Li","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Babick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Margaret C Fang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yumiko Abe-Jones","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Narges Alipanah","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Francisco N Alvarez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20078642","rel_title":"Impact of ethnicity on outcome of severe COVID-19 infection.

Group testing offers a way to increase throughput by testing pools of combined samples; however, most proposed designs have not yet addressed key concerns over sensitivity loss and implementation feasibility. Here, we combine a mathematical model of epidemic spread and empirically derived viral kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 infections to identify pooling designs that are robust to changes in prevalence, and to ratify losses in sensitivity against the time course of individual infections. Using this framework, we show that prevalence can be accurately estimated across four orders of magnitude using only a few dozen pooled tests without the need for individual identification. We then exhaustively evaluate the ability of different pooling designs to maximize the number of detected infections under various resource constraints, finding that simple pooling can identify up to 20 times as many positives compared to individual testing with a given budget. We illustrate how pooling affects sensitivity and overall detection capacity during an epidemic and on each day post infection, finding that sensitivity loss is mainly attributed to individuals sampled at the end of infection. Crucially, we confirm that our theoretical results can be accurately translated into practice using pooled human nasopharyngeal specimens. Our results show that accounting for variation in sampled viral loads provides a nuanced picture of how pooling affects sensitivity to detect epidemiologically relevant infections. Using simple, practical group testing designs can vastly increase surveillance capabilities in resource-limited settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"James A Hay","author_inst":"Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brendan Blumenstiel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Maegan Harden","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michelle Cipicchio","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jon Bezney","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Brooke Simonton","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"David Hong","author_inst":"Wharton Statistics, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Madikay Senghore","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abdul K Sesay","author_inst":"MRC Unit The Gambia at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stacey Gabriel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20084947","rel_title":"Voluntary Cyclical Distancing: A potential alternative to constant level mandatory social distancing, relying on an 'infection weather report'","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20084947","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has significantly changed our daily lives.

It measures the average number of people that will be infected by a single contagious individual. A value of Reff > 1 suggests that an outbreak will occur, while Reff< 1 suggests the virus will die out. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries worldwide are implementing a range of intervention measures, such as population-wide social distancing and case isolation, with the goal of reducing Reff to values below one, to slow or eliminate transmission. We analyse case data from 25 international locations to estimate their Reff values over time and to assess the effectiveness of interventions, equivalent to New Zealand's Alert Levels 1-4, for reducing transmission. Our results show that strong interventions, equivalent to NZ's Alert Level 3 or 4, have been successful at reducing Reff below the threshold for outbreak. In general, countries that implemented strong interventions earlier in their outbreak have managed to maintain case numbers at lower levels. These estimates provide indicative ranges of Reff for each Alert Level, to inform parameters in models of COVID-19 spread under different intervention scenarios in New Zealand and worldwide. Predictions from such models are important for informing policy and decisions on intervention timing and stringency during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Brooke Simonton","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"David Hong","author_inst":"Wharton Statistics, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Madikay Senghore","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abdul K Sesay","author_inst":"MRC Unit The Gambia at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stacey Gabriel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086975","rel_title":"Sex-specific differences in COVID-19 testing, cases and outcomes: a population-wide study in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086975","rel_abs":"In this population-wide study in Ontario, Canada we report on all 194,372 unique residents who received testing for SARS-CoV-2 between January 23, 2020 and April 28, 2020.

Method: A polynomial function was applied to daily Apple and Docomo data to calculate the observed R(t). Results: The correlation coefficient among Apple and Docomo data was 0.91. The adjusted coefficient of determination for R(t) for the whole study period was higher using Docomo data than when Apple data were used. When we regressed R(t) on daily Apple and Docomo data simultaneously, the estimated coefficient of Docomo data was not significant. Discussion and Conclusion: We demonstrated that Apple mobility data might be superior to Docomo data for explaining the entire course of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junko Kurita","author_inst":"Department of Nursing , Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tamie Sugawara","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Ohkusa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Michael Hillmer","author_inst":"Ontario Ministry of Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paula A.

This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of face mask in community settings in slowing the spread of respiratory viruses such as SARS- CoV-2. Methods The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search using PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database were performed using Medical subject heading (MeSH) words from the year 2000-2020. The articles focused on the use of masks and N95 respirators in healthcare workers were excluded. Results A total of 305 records were identified, out of which 14 articles were included in the review based upon quality and eligibility criteria. All the articles mentioned about the role of face masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, in the community or experimental setting. Studies also suggested that early initiation of face mask usage was more effective. Masks were also reported to be more effective in viruses that transmit easily from asymptomatic individuals, as is now known in SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Theoretical, experimental, and clinical evidence suggested that usage of face masks in a general population offered significant benefit in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses especially in the pandemic situation, but its utility is limited by inconsistent adherence to mask usage.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MADHU GUPTA","author_inst":"postgraduate institute of medical education and research"},{"author_name":"Khushi Gupta","author_inst":"The Shri Ram School, Gurugram"},{"author_name":"Sarika Gupta","author_inst":"Saral Diagnostic center, Pitampura, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Michael Hillmer","author_inst":"Ontario Ministry of Health, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paula A.

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal. The results suggest that only the scientific, but contextually appropriate messages about the disease should be disseminated to reduce unnecessary fears and anxiety. Awareness interventions to promote mental well-being need to be integrated into the response interventions. Community mental health care should be made accessible to at-risk groups.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anil Sigdel","author_inst":"Chitwan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Anu Bista","author_inst":"Family Planning Association of Nepal"},{"author_name":"Navaraj Bhattarai","author_inst":"Little Buddha College of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bimal Chandra Poon","author_inst":"Nick Simon Institute, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Govind Giri","author_inst":"Nobel College"},{"author_name":"Hannah Marqusee","author_inst":"Independent Consultant"},{"author_name":"subash Thapa","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"David Hong","author_inst":"Wharton Statistics, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Madikay Senghore","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abdul K Sesay","author_inst":"MRC Unit The Gambia at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stacey Gabriel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Olga B Botvinnik","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Jennifer M Davis","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gloria D Castenada","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"CLIAHub Consortium","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Rand M Dadasovich","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087031","rel_title":"Cancer is associated with the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087031","rel_abs":"Background: Cancer patients are considered a highly vulnerable population in the COVID-19 epidemic, but the relationship between cancer and the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 and to examine whether cancer patients with COVID-19 may be at an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search in seven databases was performed, to identified studies reporting the prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients, or providing data of cancer between patients with severe or non-severe illness or between non-survivors and survivors. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence and odds risk (OR) using the inverse variance method with the random-effects model. Results: Thirty-four studies with 8080 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.0% (95% CI: 2.0% to 3.0%). The prevalence in Italy (5.0%), France (6.0%), and Korea (4.0%) were higher than that in China (2.0%). Cancer was associated with a 2.84-fold significantly increased risk of severe illness (OR = 2.84, 95%CI: 1.75 to 4.62, P < 0.001) and a 2.60-fold increased risk of death (OR = 2.60, 95%CI: 1.28 to 5.26, P = 0.008) in patients with COVID-19. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable after excluding studies with a sample size of less than 100.

The immunological changes associated with this infection are largely unknown. Methods We evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells profile of 63 patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis and the presence of association with inflammatory biomarkers and 28-days mortality. Results Lymphocytopenia was present in 51 of 63 (80.9%) patients. This reduction was mirrored also on CD8+ lymphocytes (128 cells\/uL), natural killer cells (67 cells\/uL) and natural killer T cells (31 cells\/uL). Monocytes were preserved in total number but displayed a subpopulation composed mainly of cells with a reduced expression of both CD14 and HLA-DR. A direct correlation was found between serum values of IL-6 and the frequency of Th2 lymphocytes (R=0.17; p=0.04) but not with the monocytes count (R=0.01; p=0.60). Patients who died in the 28 days from admission (N=10, 15.9%), when compared to those who did not, displayed lower mean values of CD3+ (p=0.028) and CD4+ cells (p=0.042) and higher mean percentages of CD8+\/CD38+\/HLA-DR+ lymphocytes (p=0.026). Conclusions The early phases of COVID-19 are characterized by lymphocytopenia, predominance of Th2 lymphocytes and less immunocompetent monocytes, which include atypical mononuclear cells.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ANDREA LOMBARDI","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Elena Trombetta","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Cattaneo","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Valeria Castelli","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Palomba","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Mario Tirone","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Davide Mangioni","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lamorte","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Maria Manunta","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Daniele Prati","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Ferruccio Ceriotti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Roberta Gualtierotti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Costantino","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Stefano Aliberti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Vittorio Scaravilli","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Grasselli","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gori","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Laura Porretti","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Bandera","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"},{"author_name":"Joseph L DeRisi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Angela M Detweiler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"John R Haliburton","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Samantha L Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Kerkhoff","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Renuka Kumar","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sabrina A Mann","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Sandra P Martinez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rupa Marya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Eran Mick","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Lusajo L Mwakibete","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Nader Najafi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael J Peluso","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Maira S Phelps","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Angela O Pisco","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kalani Ratnasiri","author_inst":"Stanford"},{"author_name":"Luis A Rubio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Anna B Sellas","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Kyla D Sherwood","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sheu","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Natasha Spottiswoode","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Guixa Yu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kirsten N Kangelaris","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087114","rel_title":"Lung disease severity, Coronary Artery Calcium, Coronary inflammation and Mortality in Coronavirus Disease 2019.","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087114","rel_abs":"The authors have withdrawn this manuscript at the request of their local IRB, because the objectives outlined in this study were not specifically approved by the IRB.

Many clinical trials have been initiated with existing medications, but assessments of the expected plasma and lung exposures at the selected doses have not featured in the prioritisation process. Although no antiviral data is currently available for the major phenolic circulating metabolite of nitazoxanide (known as tizoxanide), the parent ester drug has been shown to exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nitazoxanide is an anthelmintic drug and its metabolite tizoxanide has been described to have broad antiviral activity against influenza and other coronaviruses. The present study used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to inform optimal doses of nitazoxanide capable of maintaining plasma and lung tizoxanide exposures above the reported nitazoxanide 90% effective concentration (EC90) against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A whole-body PBPK model was constructed for oral administration of nitazoxanide and validated against available tizoxanide pharmacokinetic data for healthy individuals receiving single doses between 500 mg SARS-CoV-2 4000 mg with and without food. Additional validation against multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data when given with food was conducted. The validated model was then used to predict alternative doses expected to maintain tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported nitazoxanide EC90 in >90% of the simulated population. Optimal design software PopDes was used to estimate an optimal sparse sampling strategy for future clinical trials. Results: The PBPK model was validated with AAFE values between 1.01 SARS-CoV-2 1.58 and a difference less than 2-fold between observed and simulated values for all the reported clinical doses. The model predicted optimal doses of 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg TID, 2900 mg BID in the fasted state and 700 mg QID, 900 mg TID and 1400 mg BID when given with food, to provide tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported in vitro EC90 of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2. For BID regimens an optimal sparse sampling strategy of 0.25, 1, 3 and 12h post dose was estimated. Conclusion: The PBPK model predicted that it was possible to achieve plasma and lung tizoxanide concentrations, using proven safe doses of nitazoxanide, that exceed the EC90 for SARS-CoV-2. The PBPK model describing tizoxanide plasma pharmacokinetics after oral administration of nitazoxanide was successfully validated against clinical data. This dose prediction assumes that the tizoxanide metabolite has activity against SARS-CoV-2 similar to that reported for nitazoxanide, as has been reported for other viruses. The model and the reported dosing strategies provide a rational basis for the design (optimising plasma and lung exposures) of future clinical trials of nitazoxanide in the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajith KR Rajoli","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Henry Pertinez","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Usman Arshad","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Helen Box","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Lee Tatham","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Curley","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Neary","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths immediately indicate that countries like Italy and Spain have the worst situation as of mid April 2020, on its own, reported cases do not provide a correct picture of the situation. The reason is that different countries diagnose diversely and present very distinctive reported case fatality rate (CFR). The same levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying picture. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain an uniform unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empiric. The key assumption of the method is that the real CFR in Europe of COVID-19 is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol has a dynamic nature, and it has been giving converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as of mid April 2020. From this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain an Effective Potential Growth (EPG) updated everyday providing an unbiased assessment of the countries with more potential to have an uncontrolled situation. The method developed will be used to track possible improvements on the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marti Catala","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya \/  Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia (CMCiB)"},{"author_name":"David Pino","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Miquel Marchena","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pablo Palacios","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Tomas Urdiales","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pere-Joan Cardona","author_inst":"Experimental Tuberculosis Unit (UTE).

This implies that the number of deaths per 100 infected individuals is approximately the same across diverse countries and can be estimated from the slope of the mortality level-infection level plot. The correlation presented here can potentially be combined with estimates of infection spread to forecast future mortality levels and therefore future needs in terms of healthcare and other resources.

In the attempt to search for interventions that would improve outcomes, some researchers have looked at the potential benefit of BCG vaccination. These early studies have found a statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 related mortality in countries with a current universal bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination policy; partially explained by induced heterologous immunity. However, just as the authors themselves noted, the nature of ecological studies make them very prone to the presence of several confounders. This paper tries to answer the question as to whether a statistically significant difference in mortality rates exists between countries with differing BCG vaccination policies; while being the first to try to account for most of these confounders. We compared the number of COVID-19 related deaths per 1 million inhabitants as well as the number of deaths at the time the countries hit the 1000th COVID-19 case. Countries were divided in those which never had a BCG vaccination policy, those with a prior vaccination policy and those with a current vaccination policy. All data was gathered from publicly available sources. It was found that no statistically significant difference exists in mortality rates between countries with differing BCG vaccination policies. This result seems to reflect the notion that heterologous immunity fades with time after administration. Nevertheless, the immunostimulatory potential of the BCG vaccine might still prove useful in the development of future vaccines or other prophylactic measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Alberto Paredes Mogica","author_inst":"Anahuac University"},{"author_name":"Valeria Nava","author_inst":"Anahuac University"},{"author_name":"Julian Torres","author_inst":"Central Military Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pablo Palacios","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Tomas Urdiales","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pere-Joan Cardona","author_inst":"Experimental Tuberculosis Unit (UTE).

WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. The first case in the US was reported in January 2020. Since mid-March 2020, the number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially in the States, with 1.1 million confirmed cases, and 57.4 thousand deaths as of 30 April 2020. Even though some believe that this new lethal coronavirus does not show any partiality to the rich, previous epidemiological studies find that the poor in the US are more susceptible to the epidemics due to their limited access to preventive measures and crowded living conditions. In this study, we postulate that the rich is more susceptible to Covid-19 infection during the early stage before social distancing measures have been introduced. This may be attributed to the higher mobility (both inter- and intra-city), given their higher tendency to travel for business\/education, and to more social interactions. However, we postulate after the lockdown\/social distancing has been imposed, the infection among the rich may be reduced due to better living conditions. Further, the rich may be able to afford better medical treatment once infected, hence a relatively lower mortality. In contrast, without proper medical insurance coverage, the poor may be prevented from receiving timely and proper medical treatment, hence a higher mortality. Method: We will collect the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US during the period of Jan 2020 to Apr 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, also the number of Covid-19 tests in the US from the health departments across the States. County-level socio-economic status (SES) including age, sex, race\/ethnicity, income, education, occupation, employment status, immigration status, and housing price, will be collected from the US Census Bureau. State\/county-level health conditions including the prevalence of chronic diseases will be collected from the US CDC. State\/county-level movement data including international and domestic flights will be collected from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. We will also collect the periods of lockdown\/social distancing. Regression models are constructed to examine the relationship between SES, and Covid-19 infection and mortality at the state\/county-level before and after lockdown\/social distancing, while accounting for Covid-19 testing capacities and co-morbidities. Expected Findings: We expect that there is a positive correlation between Covid-19 infection and SES at the state\/county-level in the US before social distancing. In addition, we expect a negative correlation between Covid-19 mortality and SES.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Han","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Victor O.K.

In the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul (population 11.3 million), we are carrying out fortnightly household surveys in nine of the largest cities. Multi-stage probability sampling was used in each city to select 500 households, within which one resident was randomly chosen for testing. The Wondfo lateral flow rapid test for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been validated in four different settings, including our own, with pooled estimates of sensitivity (84.8%, 95% CI 81.4%;87.8%) and specificity (99.0%, 95% CI 97.8%;99.7%), which are within the acceptable range for epidemiological studies. In the first wave of the study (April 11-13), 4,188 subjects were tested, of whom two were positive (0.0477%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0058%;0.1724%). In the second round (Apr 25-27) there were six positive subjects (0.1333%; 95% CI 0.0489%;0.2900%). We also tested family members of positive index cases, and nine out of 19 had positive results. Testing of reported COVID-19 cases according to RT-PCR confirmed that the test was highly sensitive under field conditions. The epidemic is at an early stage in the State, as the first case was reported on Feb 28, and by Apr 30, 50 deaths were registered. Strict lockdown measures were implemented in mid-March, and our results suggest that compliance was high, with full or near full compliance rates of 79.4% in the first and 71.7% in the second round. As far as we know, this is the only large population anywhere undergoing regular household serological surveys for COVID-19. The results show that the epidemic is at an early phase, and findings from the next rounds will allow us to document time trends and propose Public Health measures.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariangela Silveira","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Aluisio Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Horta","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Lucia Pellanda","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Victora","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Odir Dellagostin","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Claudio Struchiner","author_inst":"UERJ"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Burattini","author_inst":"UNIFESP"},{"author_name":"Andreia Valim","author_inst":"UNISC"},{"author_name":"Evelise Berlezi","author_inst":"UNIJUI"},{"author_name":"Jeovany Mesa","author_inst":"IMED"},{"author_name":"Maria Leticia Ikeda","author_inst":"UNISINOS"},{"author_name":"Marilia Mesenburg","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Marina Mantesso","author_inst":"UCS"},{"author_name":"Marinel Dall'Agnol","author_inst":"UFSM"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Biagini","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

In this work, we propose complementary fully automatic approaches for the classification of chest X-ray images under the analysis of 3 different categories: Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. Given the similarity between the pathological impact in the lungs between Covid-19 and pneumonia, mainly during the initial stages of both lung diseases, we performed an exhaustive study of differentiation considering different pathological scenarios. To face these classification tasks, we exploited and adapted to this topic a densely convolutional network architecture, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. To validate the designed approaches, several representative experiments were performed using images retrieved from different public chest X-ray images datasets. Overall, satisfactory results were obtained from the designed experiments, facilitating the doctors' work and allowing better an early diagnostic\/screening and treatment of this relevant pandemic pathology.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joaquim de Moura","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Jorge Novo","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Marcos Ortega","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Lucia Pellanda","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Victora","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Odir Dellagostin","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Claudio Struchiner","author_inst":"UERJ"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Burattini","author_inst":"UNIFESP"},{"author_name":"Andreia Valim","author_inst":"UNISC"},{"author_name":"Evelise Berlezi","author_inst":"UNIJUI"},{"author_name":"Jeovany Mesa","author_inst":"IMED"},{"author_name":"Maria Leticia Ikeda","author_inst":"UNISINOS"},{"author_name":"Marilia Mesenburg","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Marina Mantesso","author_inst":"UCS"},{"author_name":"Marinel Dall'Agnol","author_inst":"UFSM"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Biagini","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recommendations for sinus and anterior skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PubMed\/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Embase were searched by two independent otolaryngologists from the Young Otolaryngologists of IFOS (YO-IFOS) for studies dealing with sinus and skull base surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. The review also included unpublished guidelines edited by Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or Neurosurgery societies. Perioperative factors were investigated including surgical indications, preoperative testing of patients, practical management in operating rooms, technical aspects of surgery and postoperative management. The literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The criteria for considering studies or guidelines for the review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework. Results: 15 international publications met inclusion criteria. Five references were guidelines from national societies. All guidelines recommended postponing elective surgeries. An algorithm is proposed that classifies endonasal surgical procedures into three groups based on the risk of postponing surgery. Patients COVID-19 status should be preoperatively assessed. Highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended, and the use of high-speed powered devices should be avoided. Face-to-face postoperative visits must be limited. Conclusions: Sinus and skull base surgeries are high-risk procedures due to potential aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Protection of health care workers by decreasing exposure and optimizing use of PPE is essential with sinus and anterior skull base surgery.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"thomas radulesco","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome R Lechien","author_inst":"Department of Human Anatomy and Experimental Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, UMONS Research Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, University of Mons (UMo"},{"author_name":"Leigh Sowerby","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."},{"author_name":"sven saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Carlos Chiesa-estomba","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain"},{"author_name":"Zoukaa Sargi","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lavigne","author_inst":"Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Christian Calvo-Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela-Spain"},{"author_name":"Chwee Ming Lim","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School.

It is suggested that potential acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 from prior exposure may be determined by detecting the presence of circulating IgG antibodies against viral antigens, such as the spike glycoprotein and its receptor binding domain (RBD). Testing our asymptomatic population for evidence of COVID-19 immunity would also offer valuable epidemiologic data to aid health care policies and health care management. Currently, there are over 100 antibody tests that are being used around the world without approval from the FDA or similar regulatory bodies, and they are mostly for rapid and qualitative assessment, with different degrees of error rates. ELISA-based testing for sensitive and rigorous quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can potentially offer mechanistic insights into the COVID-19 disease and aid communities uniquely challenged by limited financial resources and access to commercial testing products. Employing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and spike protein generated in the laboratory, we devised a quantitative ELISA for the detection of circulating serum antibodies. Serum from twenty SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients were used to detect circulating IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD. Quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to the spike glycoprotein or the RBD in patient samples was not always associated with faster recovery, compared to patients with borderline antibody response to the RBD. One patient who did not develop antibodies to the RBD completely recovered from COVID-19. In surveying 99 healthy donor samples (procured between 2017-February 2020), we detected RBD antibodies in one donor from February 2020 collection with three others exhibiting antibodies to the spike protein but not the RBD. Collectively, our study suggests that more rigorous and quantitative analysis, employing large scale sample sets, is required to determine whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD is associated with protection from COVID-19 disease. It is also conceivable that humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD works in association with adaptive T cell response to determine clinical sequela and severity of COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathleen M McAndrews","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dara P Dowlatshahi","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Janine Hensel","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Luis L Ostrosky-Zeichner","author_inst":"Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Papanna","author_inst":"UT Medical School at Houston"},{"author_name":"Valerie S LeBleu","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Raghu Kalluri","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Christian Calvo-Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela-Spain"},{"author_name":"Chwee Ming Lim","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School.

The successful control of the pandemic carried out by China and South Korea is studied using a scheme based on the net relative rate of infection which is very sensitive to sudden changes in the epidemic evolution. The net relative rate of infection for China and South Korea without containment measures, that is, with free proliferation of the virus, lies between 10 and 40 %\/day or doubling times of infected persons between 3.5 and 2 days. After measures of containment it dropped and stabilized. South Korea stabilized it around 1 %\/day and China around 0.05 %\/day with doubling times of 70 days and 1400 days, respectively. A discussion is provided about their processes of control and stabilization of the epidemic process and about the scheme used to study them.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joao M L Moreira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do ABC"},{"author_name":"Dara P Dowlatshahi","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Janine Hensel","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Luis L Ostrosky-Zeichner","author_inst":"Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Papanna","author_inst":"UT Medical School at Houston"},{"author_name":"Valerie S LeBleu","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Raghu Kalluri","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Christian Calvo-Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela-Spain"},{"author_name":"Chwee Ming Lim","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School.
