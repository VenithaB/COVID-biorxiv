However, the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Shenzhen, China remains unknown. Individual data of 417 cases were extracted from the epidemiological investigations and the National Infectious Disease Information System between January 1, 2020 and February 29, 2020. On the basis of important interventions, the epidemic was divided into four periods (January 1-15, January 16-22, January 23-February 5 and after February 6). We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered model to evaluate the effect of interventions. Results suggested that about 53.7% were imported from Wuhan. The median age was 47 years and 52.8% were women. Severity risk increased with age and associated with male and co-existing disorders. The attack rate peaked in the third period and drastically decreased afterwards across sex, age groups and geographic regions. Children younger than 5 years showed a higher attack rate than those aged of 6~19. The effective reproductive number decreased from 1.44 to 0.05 after the highest level emergency response since January 23. Overall, the non-pharmaceutical interventions have effectively mitigated the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. These findings may facilitate the introduction of public health policies in other countries and regions.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuan Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xu Xie","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dongfeng Kong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ziquan Lv","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guohong Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20091454","rel_title":"Early Awake Prone and Lateral Position in Non-intubated Severe and Critical Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan: A Respective Cohort Study","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20091454","rel_abs":"Background Previous studies suggest applying prone position (PP) and lateral position (LP) in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for their efficacy in improving oxygenation and lung recruitment.This paper aims to share clinical experiences and outcome of using PP and LP in combination with oxygen therapy (OT) and Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in severe and critical patients with COVID-19. Methods Clinical data of 48 severe and critical patients have been retrieved from medical records and reviewed. The primary outcome is the survival rate. Secondary outcome is the rate of patients requiring intubation. Results In total, 25 patients were finally included in the study.The mean respiratory rate of all 25 patients decreased from 28.4 breaths\/min to 21.3 breaths\/min. CT results showed increase in lung recruitment. All patients tolerated PP and LP well. No deterioration or severe adverse events associated with PP and LP occurred. All patients recovered and survived without intubation. Follow-up to date showed that all patients have been discharged except one with mild symptoms and positive RNA test. Conclusion: Clinical outcomes of early application of PP and LP in combination with OT and NIV in severe and critical patients with COVID-19 indicated well tolerance of the therapy and resulted in improving patients' oxygenation in a safe and effective manner. Therefore, this strategy can be explored as an early intervention in managing patients in early stage of disease development under the context of pandemic and limited medical resources.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Dong","author_inst":"1.Critical Care Medicine Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Yiping Gong","author_inst":"1.\tDepartment of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Feng","author_inst":"1.\tDepartment of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,Wuhan,Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Lang Bai","author_inst":"1.Center of Infectious Diseases, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.Department of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Haomiao Qing","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Peng Zhou","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Yu Du","author_inst":"1.Emergency department and intensive care unit, West China School of Public Health, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.D"},{"author_name":"Junchen Zhu","author_inst":"1.Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.Department of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan Universi"},{"author_name":"Shanling Xu","author_inst":"1.Critical Care Medicine Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ziquan Lv","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guohong Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095877","rel_title":"Forecasting Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in India under Various Containment Measures- A Time-Dependent State-Space SIR Approach","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095877","rel_abs":"Objectives Our primary objective is to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India while adjusting for the effects of various progressively implemented containment measures. Apart from forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India. Methods We propose a method based on time-series SIR model to estimate time-dependent modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR model to estimate reproduction number R0, expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison. Results Assuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020. For the same case, estimates of R0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day) infectious period. Conclusions Estimated modifiers give consistent estimates of unadjusted R0 across different scenarios, demonstrating precision. Results corroborate the effectiveness of lockdown measures in substantially reducing R0. Also, predictions are highly sensitive towards estimate of infectious period.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vishal Deo","author_inst":"Ramjas College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anuradha Rajkonwar Chetiya","author_inst":"Ramjas College, University of delhi"},{"author_name":"Barnali Deka","author_inst":"Ramjas College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gurprit Grover","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Haomiao Qing","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Peng Zhou","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Yu Du","author_inst":"1.Emergency department and intensive care unit, West China School of Public Health, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China;

An exhaustive statistical analysis encompassing arithmetic, geometric, harmonic means, standard deviation, skewness, variance, Pearson and Spearman correlation was derived from the data collected from Turkey and South Africa within the period of 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and 05 March and 3 of May respectively. It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people was obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The prediction shows that Turkey may register in the near future approximately more than 6000 new infections in a day as worst case scenario; and less than 300 cases in the perfect scenario. However, the country could register in the near future a daily number of 27000 people recovered from COVID-19 in the perfect scenario; and less than 5000 people in a worst scenario. Moreover, Turkey in a worst-case scenario could record a high number of approximately 200 deaths per day; and less than 150 deaths in a perfect scenario. Similarly, in the case of South Africa, the prediction results show that in the near future the country could register about 500 new infected cases daily and more than 25 deaths in the worst scenario; while in a perfect scenario less than 50 new infected and zero death cases could be recorded. The histograms of the daily number of newly infected, recovered and death showed a sign of lognormal and normal distribution, which is presented using the Bell curving method parameters estimation. A new mathematical model COVID-19 comprised of nine classes was suggested; of which a formula of the reproductive number, well-poseness of the solutions and the stability analysis were presented in details. The suggested model was further extended to the scope of nonlocal operators for each case; whereby the Atangana-Seda numerical method was used to provide numerical solutions, and simulations were performed for different non-integer numbers. Additionally, sections devoted to control optimal and others dedicated to compare cases between Turkey and South Africa with the aim to comprehend why there are less numbers of deaths and infected people in South Africa than Turkey were presented in details.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdon ATANGANA","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF FREE STATE"},{"author_name":"Seda IGRET ARAZ","author_inst":"Siirt university"},{"author_name":"Qiu Yuqing","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Samore","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Haomiao Qing","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Peng Zhou","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Yu Du","author_inst":"1.Emergency department and intensive care unit, West China School of Public Health, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.D"},{"author_name":"Junchen Zhu","author_inst":"1.Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.Department of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan Universi"},{"author_name":"Shanling Xu","author_inst":"1.Critical Care Medicine Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ziquan Lv","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guohong Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095471","rel_title":"Treatment of COVID-19 Patients with Convalescent Plasma in Houston, Texas","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095471","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally, and no proven treatments are available. Convalescent plasma therapy has been used with varying degrees of success to treat severe microbial infections for more than 100 years. Methods: Patients (n=25) with severe and\/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 to April 14, 2020. Patients were transfused with convalescent plasma obtained from donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had been symptom free for 14 days. The primary study outcome was safety, and the secondary outcome was clinical status at day 14 post-transfusion. Clinical improvement was assessed based on a modified World Health Organization 6-point ordinal scale and laboratory parameters. Viral genome sequencing was performed on donor and recipient strains. Results: At baseline, all patients were receiving supportive care, including anti-inflammatory and anti-viral treatments, and all patients were on oxygen support. At day 7 post-transfusion with convalescent plasma, nine patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical scale, and seven of those were discharged. By day 14 post-transfusion, 19 (76%) patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical status and 11 were discharged. No adverse events as a result of plasma transfusion were observed. The whole genome sequencing data did not identify a strain genotype-disease severity correlation. Conclusions: The data indicate that administration of convalescent plasma is a safe treatment option for those with severe COVID-19 disease. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to determine its efficacy.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Salazar","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katherine K.

Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and employ systems that effectively manage the demand for services. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of the first five weeks of a 24\/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline. Design: Cohort study using electronic health records. Setting: A single large health care system in Northeast Ohio. Participants: During 5 weeks of operation, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers) and were evaluated by a registered nurse (RN) using standardized protocols. Of these, 4,213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). The mean age of callers was 42 years. 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid or uninsured. Intervention: Physician telehealth visits for COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race\/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing. Results: Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 (7%) patients had a subsequent ED visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency room use (OR=4.73, 95%CI 1.37-16.39, p=.014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Conclusions and Relevance: Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Margolius","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Mary Hennekes","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Jimmy Yaho","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Douglas Einstadter","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Douglas Gunzler","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of suspect cases of COVID-19 in migrants in transit and asylum seekers in Mexico, and to compare their characteristics with those of non-migrants. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of information from the surveillance system of Mexico from January 1 to May 3 2020, identifying persons from the main sending countries of mixed migrant flows in Mexico (Central America, the Caribbean, Venezuela and African countries), in northern and southern Mexican border states. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics, risk conditions, and epidemic curves for migrants and non-migrants. Also, we estimated the cumulative incidence for non-migrants, and for migrants in two scenarios defined by different estimations of their population size. RESULTS: Migrants were on average younger, had less accompanying risk conditions, and a lower percentage of suspect cases tested positive for COVID-19. The odds of hospitalization were lower among migrants, but the difference disappeared after adjusting by age, gender and underlying risk conditions. The cumulative incidence ratios comparing migrants with non-migrants were 6.12 (CI95% 4.75,7.77) for the first scenario, and 1.49 (CI95% 1.15,1.89) for the second scenario. CONCLUSION: Migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico are at increased risk for infectious respiratory diseases, and could be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. It is important to continue monitoring the situation, with more detailed information about migration status, living conditions and other determinants of migrants health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ietza Bojorquez","author_inst":"El Colegio de la Frontera Norte"},{"author_name":"Cesar Infante","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica"},{"author_name":"Isabel Vieitez","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Silvana Larrea","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santoro","author_inst":"Medicos del Mundo"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

Reporting artefacts and missing data about asymptomatic spreaders, imply considerable margins of uncertainty for model-based predictions. Epidemiological models can however also be used to investigate the consequences of measures to control the pandemic, reflected in changes to parameter values. We present a SIR-based, SUIR model in which the influence of testing and a reduction of contacts is studied by distinguishing 'Unidentified' and 'Identified' spreaders of infections. The model uses four ordinary differential equations and is kept deliberately simple to investigate general patterns occurring from testing and contact restrictions. The model goes beyond other efforts, by introducing time dependent parameter curves that represent different strategies in controlling the pandemic. Our analysis reveals the effect of 'pro-active' testing for the design of contact restriction measures. By pro-active testing we mean testing beyond those people who show symptoms. The simulations can explain why the timing of contract restrictions and pro-active testing is important. The model can also be used to study the consequence of different strategies to exit from lockdown. Our SUIR model is implemented in Python and is made available through a Juypter Notebooks. This an extensive documentation of the derivation and implementation of the model, as well as transparent and reproducible simulation studies. Our model should contribute to a better understanding of the role of testing and contact restrictions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saptarshi Bej","author_inst":"University of Rostock"},{"author_name":"Olaf Wolkenhauer","author_inst":"University of Rostock"},{"author_name":"Isabel Vieitez","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Silvana Larrea","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santoro","author_inst":"Medicos del Mundo"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

The first incident of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India was reported on 30 January 2020, which was a student from Wuhan. The number of reported cases has started to increase day by day after 30 February 2020. The purpose of this investigation is to provide a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in India by utilizing real-time data from 30 February to 14 April 2020. We apply the well-known epidemic compartmental model \"SEIR\" to predict the epidemic peak of COVID-19, India. Since we do not have the complete detail of the infective population, using the available infected population data, we identify the R0 by using polynomial regression. By using the third-order polynomial equation, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in India is R0 = 3.3 (95%CI, 3.1 to 3.5), and the epidemic peak could be reached by September 2020.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"R V Belfin","author_inst":"Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Piotr Brodka","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"BL Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences"},{"author_name":"V Rejula","author_inst":"Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santoro","author_inst":"Medicos del Mundo"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

To determine whether COVID-19 prevalence is modulated by meteorological conditions, meta-regression of Japanese prefectural data was herein conducted. We extracted integrated number of patients testing positive for COVID-19 in each Japanese prefecture on 18 May 2020, population per 1-km2 inhabitable area in the prefecture in 2020, and monthly meteorological conditions at each prefectural capital city for 4 months (from January to April 2020). We averaged or cumulated the monthly data for the 4 months. To adjust for prefectural population density, we defined the COVID-19 prevalence as the integrated number of patients testing positive divided by the population per 100-km2 inhabitable area. Random-effects meta-regression was performed. A slope of the meta-regression line was significantly negative for mean air temperature (coefficient, -0.134; P = 0.019), mean sea level air pressure (-0.351; P = 0.001), and mean daily maximum UV index (-0.908; P = 0.012), which indicated that COVID-19 prevalence decreased significantly as air temperature, air pressure, and UV index increased. In conclusion, higher temperature, pressure, and UV may be associated with less COVID-19 prevalence, which should be confirmed by further epidemiological investigations taking other risk and protective factors of COVID-19 into account.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hisato Takagi","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Toshiki Kuno","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yujiro Yokoyama","author_inst":"Easton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiroki Ueyama","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Takuya Matsushiro","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yosuke Hari","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

Therefore, to guide diagnostic laboratories globally, we conducted a systematic review to determine the utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. A systematic search of major databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) was performed to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There was a total of 10 publications that fit the criteria for review. Most studies collected drooled whole saliva from hospitalized patients or pipetted saliva from intubated patients. Saliva was positive in 31-92% of patients depending on the cohort and length of hospitalization. Viral loads in saliva are comparable to those in NPS and ranged from 9.9 x 10^2 to 1.2 x 10^8 copies\/mL during the first week of symptoms and decrease over time. Saliva can be positive up to 20 days post-symptom onset with viral loads correlating with symptom severity and degree of tissue damage. Based on these findings, we made suggestions to guide the clinical laboratory and suggest the need for diagnostic accuracy studies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zohaib Khurshid","author_inst":"King Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Sana Zohaib","author_inst":"King Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Joshi","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Syed Faraz Moin","author_inst":"University of Karachi"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Sohail Zafar","author_inst":"Taibah University"},{"author_name":"David J Speicher","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

We aim to decipher SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types, the consequent host immune response and their interplay in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Design: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung samples from 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 mild patients who recovered and 8 healthy controls). The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated. Results: Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced IFN{gamma}, Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection breaks the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huarong Chen","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Weixin Liu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Dabin Liu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Liuyang Zhao","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jun Yu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"David J Speicher","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

Healthcare providers are at increased risks of infection when caring for patients with COVID-19. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. However, there is growing evidence for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to direct droplet spread and indirect contact. Here, we report on the design, construction, and testing of the BADGER (Box for Aerosol and Droplet Guarding and Evacuation in Respiratory Infection), an affordable, scalable device that can contain droplets and aerosol particles. The BADGER has multiple hand-ports for healthcare providers to perform essential tasks on a patient's airway and head. A semi-sealed environment is created inside the BADGER, which maintains at least twelve-air changes per hour using in-wall vacuum suction. Qualitative testing demonstrates that under conditions typical of non-invasive supplemental oxygen treatment, the BADGER can contain nebulized denatonium benzoate and smoke. Quantitative aerosol testing shows more than 90% containment of sub-micrometer aerosolized particles. Overall, the BADGER has the potential to contain large droplets and small airborne particles, and to provide an additional layer of protection for healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hau D.

The elevation of cytokines in blood is crucial to induce cytokine storm and immunosuppression in the transition of severity in COVID-19 patients. However, the comprehensive changes of serum proteins in COVID-19 patients throughout the SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. In this work, we developed a high-density antibody microarray and performed an in-depth proteomics analysis of serum samples collected from early COVID-19 (n=15) and influenza (n=13) patients. We identified a large set of differentially expressed proteins (n=125) that participate in a landscape of inflammation and immune signaling related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the significant correlations of neutrophil and lymphocyte with the CCL2 and CXCL10 mediated cytokine signaling pathways was identified. These information are valuable for the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, identification of biomarkers and development of the optimal anti-inflammation therapy.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Hou","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Xian Wu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Minya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Dan Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Meng Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hongye Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

It is unknown whether COVID-19 incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency and treatment. Objective: To examine whether vitamin D deficiency and treatment are associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: University of Chicago Medicine Participants: Patients tested for COVID-19 from 3\/3\/2020-4\/10\/2020. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the most recent 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20ng\/ml or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol <18pg\/ml within 1 year before COVID-19 testing. Treatment was defined by the most recent vitamin D type and dose, and treatment changes between the time of the most recent vitamin D level and time of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing as likely deficient(last-level-deficient\/treatment-not-increased), likely sufficient(last-level-not-deficient\/treatment-not-decreased), or uncertain deficiency(last-level-deficient\/treatment-increased or last-level-not-deficient\/treatment-decreased). Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was testing positive for COVID-19. Multivariable analysis tested whether the most recent vitamin D level and treatment changes after that level were associated with testing positive for COVID-19 controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. Bivariate analyses of associations of treatment with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 were performed. Results: Among 4,314 patients tested for COVID-19, 499 had a vitamin D level in the year before testing. Vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 127(25%) patients, likely sufficient for 291(58%) patients, and uncertain for 81(16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age(RR(age<50)=1.05,p<0.021;RR(age[&ge;]50)=1.02,p<0.064)), non-white race(RR=2.54,p<0.01) and being likely vitamin D deficient (deficient\/treatment-not-increased:RR=1.77,p<0.02) as compared to likely vitamin D sufficient(not-deficient\/treatment-not-decreased), with predicted COVID-19 rates in the vitamin D deficient group of 21.6%(95%CI[14.0%-29.2%] ) versus 12.2%(95%CI[8.9%-15.4%]) in the vitamin D sufficient group. Vitamin D deficiency declined with increasing vitamin D dose, especially of vitamin D3. Vitamin D dose was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Vitamin D deficiency that is not sufficiently treated is associated with COVID-19 risk. Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency to address COVID-19 warrant aggressive pursuit and study.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David O Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Thomas J Best","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Tamara Vokes","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vineet Arora","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Julian Solway","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Hongye Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

However severity of disease varies considerably and understanding physiological changes that may link to poor outcomes is important. Although increased serum ferritin has been observed in COVID-19 patients consistent with inflammation, other iron parameters have not been examined to our knowledge. Because iron is required for immunity and oxygen utilisation, and dysregulated iron homeostasis has been observed in COPD, we investigated serum iron concentrations in 30 patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission. All patients had low serum iron but patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure had more profound hypoferraemia. The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for serum iron to identify severe hypoxemia was 0.95; the optimal Youden Index for distinguishing between severe and non-severe hypoxemia was a serum iron concentration of 2.9 micromol\/L. By linear regression, serum iron was associated with lymphocyte count and PaO2\/FiO2. In conclusion, profound hypoferraemia identifies COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxaemia. Serum iron is a simple biomarker that could be usefully employed to stratify patients and monitor disease. Severe hypoferraemia may plausibly impair critical iron-dependent processes such as lymphocyte responses and hypoxia sensing, contributing to pathology, and is potentially treatable.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshay Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Joe Frost","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise Aaron","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Killian Donovan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stuart McKechnie","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

A large set of data collected at a worldwide scale during the first months of 2020 is compiled into series of semi-logarithmic plots, for a selection of thirty-two countries from the five continents. Three regimes are identified in the propagation of an epidemic wave: a pre-epidemic regime 1, an exponential-growth regime 2, and a resorption regime 3. A two-parameters scaling of the first-wave death variation reported in China is used to fit those reported in other countries. Comparison is made between the propagation of the pandemic in different countries, which are classified in four groups, from group A where the pandemic first waves were contained efficiently, to group D where the pandemic first waves widely spread. Group A is mainly composed of Asian countries, where fast and efficient measures have been applied. Group D is composed of Western-Europe countries and the United States of America, where late decisions and confused political communication (pandemic seriousness, protection masks, herd immunity etc.) led to significant death tolls. The threat of large resurging epidemic waves after a hasty lockdown lift is discussed, in particular for the countries from group D, where the number of contagious people remained high in the beginning of May 2020. The situation is opposite in Asian countries from group A, where the number of contagious people was successfully maintained to a low level. In particular, the results obtained by Hong Kong and South Korea are highlighted, and the measures taken there are presented as virtuous examples that other countries may follow.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Knafo","author_inst":"CNRS\/LNCMI"},{"author_name":"Joe Frost","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise Aaron","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Killian Donovan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stuart McKechnie","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

Since the total number of people infected by the virus is uncertain, we have considered the trend of ICU patients, ICU patients plus deaths, and finally the sum of hospitalized patients plus the deceased. The growth of the corresponding curves is similar for all the three graphs while the trend after the turning point is completely different. We find that the curve of ICU patients can be a useful tool to monitor the behavior of epidemic and a model to predict the future evolution of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Feoli","author_inst":"University of Benevento"},{"author_name":"Antonella Lucia Iannella","author_inst":"University of Benevento"},{"author_name":"Elmo Benedetto","author_inst":"University of Benevento"},{"author_name":"Killian Donovan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stuart McKechnie","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

The serious limitations of using crude COVID-19 CFRs for comparisons between countries have been addressed in the literature but are often overlooked or misunderstood, both in the scientific literature and in the media. In this paper we examined the extent to which age distribution of the cases is responsible for the differences in CFRs between countries. Methods Data on COVID-19 were extracted from the reports of individual countries. Overall and age-specific CFRs were available for six countries. The CFRs by country were adjusted for age using the direct method, using the combined age-specific number of cases of all six countries as the standard population. Findings The age distribution of the cases varied widely between countries. The crude CFRs varied between 1.6% and 11%. The differences in the age-specific CFRs were much smaller and the age-adjusted rates were much closer than the crude rates. The ratio of the crude CFR for the country with the highest CFR to that with the lowest, was reduced substantially for the age-adjusted rates, from 7.4 to 2.3 Conclusions The age structure of the cases dramatically impacts on the differences in the crude CFRs between countries. Adjusting for age substantially reduces this variation. Other factors such as the differences in the definition of the denominators, the definition of a case and the standard of healthcare are likely to account for much of the residual variation. It is misleading to compare the crude COVID-19 CFRs between countries and should be avoided. At the very least, comparisons should be based on age-specific and age-adjusted rates.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manfred S Green","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Victoria Peer","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Naama Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Dorit Nitzan","author_inst":"World Health Organization, European Region"},{"author_name":"Stuart McKechnie","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

High mobility between areas contribute to the importation of cases, affecting the spread of the disease. While many factors influence local incidence and making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can give rise to autonomous outbreaks that impact separate areas of the contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost local incidence and size, making control and tracing measures less effective. In Spain, the high heterogeneity in incidence between similar areas despite the uniform mobility control measures taken suggests that multi-seeding could have played an important role in shaping the spreading of the disease. In this work, we focus on the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 among the $52$ Spanish provinces, showing that local incidence strongly correlates with mobility occurred in the early-stage weeks from and to Madrid, the main mobility hub and where the initial local outbreak unfolded. These results clarify the higher order effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight the relevance of its control.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mattia Mazzoli","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB)"},{"author_name":"David Mateo","author_inst":"Kido Dynamics SA"},{"author_name":"Alberto Hernando","author_inst":"Kido Dynamics SA"},{"author_name":"Sandro Meloni","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB)"},{"author_name":"Jose Javier Ramasco","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica Insterdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB)"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

We call this Empirical Model. We also fit a Theoretical Model based on a Gamma function on the pattern of some of the previous epidemics. Results: The Empirical Model predicts the peak around the fourth week of May and the near end of the epidemic by the end of June 2020. The maximum number of active cases is likely to be nearly 75,000 during the second week of June. This would mean a peak demand of nearly 15,000 beds and nearly 4000 ventilators. The case-fatality based on those who have reached an outcome was nearly 10% in the first week of May and is likely to remain at this level for some time. Theoretical Model projected a peak of nearly 2500 new cases per day in the second week of May that seems to have been already breached.

They have been implemented globally during the pandemic, however, the specific NPIs implemented and the timing of interventions has varied widely. We validated two published datasets on the implementation of NPIs globally. The health and socioeconomic factors associated with delay in implementation of NPIs was analyzed using fractional logit and probit models, and beta regression models. The probability of timely NPI implementation by a country was analyzed using a probit model. The effects of these interventions on mobility changes using Google social mobility reports, were analyzed with propensity score matching methods. Three NPIs were analyzed: national school closure, national lockdown, and global travel ban. Countries with higher incomes, larger populations, and better health preparedness measures had greater delays in implementation. Countries with greater population density, more democratic political systems, lower case detection capacity, and later arrival of first cases were more likely to implement NPIs. Implementation of lockdowns significantly reduced physical mobility. Mobility was further reduced when lockdowns were enforced with curfews or fines, or were more strictly defined. National school closures did not significantly change mobility. The implementation of NPIs is a global public good during pandemics, and the international community needs to address constraints and design incentives so countries implement NPIs in a timely manner. Further analysis is needed on the effect of NPI variations on mobility and transmission, and their associated costs.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amit Summan","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy"},{"author_name":"Arindam Nandi","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Qaiser Iqbal","author_inst":"University of Balochistan, Quetta"},{"author_name":"Asad Khan","author_inst":"Quaid i Azam University"},{"author_name":"Nazar Mohammad","author_inst":"World Health Organization, Quetta"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

Sufficient training of healthcare workers (HCWs) in how to manage COVID-19 and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to enable them to do so will be key tools in allowing oPt to mount a credible response to the crisis. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated online questionnaire. Data collection occurred between March 30, 2020 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcomes were the availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness in oPt for COVID-19 pandemic and the secondary outcome was regional and hospital differences in oPt in terms of PPE availability and HCWs preparedness. Results: Of 138 respondents, only 38 HCWs (27.5%) always had access to facemasks when needed and 15 (10.9%) for isolation gowns. The vast majority of HCWs did not find eye protection (n=128, 92.8%), N95 respirators (n=132, 95.7%), and face shields (n=127, 92%) always available. Compared to HCWs in West Bank, those in the Gaza Strip were significantly less likely to have access to alcohol sanitizers (p=0.026) and gloves (p <0.001). On average, governmental hospitals were significantly less likely to have all appropriate PPE measures than non-governmental institutions (p = 0.001). As for preparedness, only 16 (11.6%) surveyed felt confident in dealing with a potential COVID-19 case. With 57 (41.3%) having received any COVID-19 related training and 57 (41.3%) not having a local hospital protocol. Conclusion: HCWs in oPt are underprepared and severely lacking adequate PPE provision. The lack of local protocols and training has left HCWs' confidence exceedingly low. The lack of PPE provision will exacerbate the spread of COVID-19 and deepen the crisis, whilst putting HCWs at risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory and OxPal Medlink, UK."},{"author_name":"Heba Alghoul","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Islamic University of Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory."},{"author_name":"Zahra Alkhateeb","author_inst":"Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Boston, USA."},{"author_name":"Ayah Hamdan","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

The assessment of emergency capacity in every country is a necessary part of the COVID-19 response efforts. Thus, it is extremely recommended to evaluate the health care system to prepare the country to tackle COVID-19 challenges. Methods and Findings: A retrospective and ecological study was performed with data retrieved from the public national healthcare database (DATASUS). Numbers of intensive care unit and infirmary beds, general or intensivists physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, and ventilators from each Regional Health Unity were extracted, and the beds per health professionals and ventilators per population rates were assessed. The accessibility to health services was also performed using a spatial overlay approach to verify regions that lack assistance. It was found that Brazil lacks equity, integrity, and may struggle to assist with high complexity for the COVID-19 patients in many regions of the country.

Due to the lack of drugs and prophylaxis against COVID-19, most of the countries are now relying on maintaining social distance as preventative actions. However, this social distancing can create global socio-economic crisis and psychological disorders. Therefore, these control measures need to have an assessment to evaluate their value in containing the situation. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to different control measures, health care facilities, and prevalent diseases. Based on our findings, the number of COVID-19 deaths found to be reduced with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. We found 0.23, 0.16, and 0.21 as the measurement of significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians (p-value [&le;] 7.1*10-6), nurses and midwives (p-value [&le;] 4.6*10-3), and hospital beds (p-value [&le;] 1.9*10-2). Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between the reduction of COVID-19 cases and the earliness of preventive initiation. As a result, enhancing health care facilities as well as imposing the control measures in a short time could be valuable to prevent the currently raging COVID-19 pandemic. The apathy of taking nation-wide immediate precaution measure has identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worst. Notably, countries including Gambia, Nicaragua, Burundi, Namibia, and Nepal have marked in a state of danger. Interestingly, no association between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 was found except for few diseases including cancer, which warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level. We believe that this study could be useful in developing a control strategy in COVID-19 as well as future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Faruq Abdulla","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Faculty of Sciences, Islamic University, Kushtia-7003, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Zulkar Nain","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Islamic University, Kushtia-7003, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.

Nevertheless, there is limited information describing the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Latin America. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 9,468 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Ecuador. We calculated overall incidence, mortality, case fatality rates, disability adjusted life years, attack and crude mortality rates, as well as relative risk and relative odds of death, adjusted for age, sex and presence of comorbidities. Results: A total of 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases and 474 deaths were included in the analysis. Men accounted for 55.4% (n = 5, 247) of cases and women for 44.6% (n = 4, 221). We found the presence of comorbidities, being male and older than 65 years were important determinants of mortality. Coastal regions were most affected by COVID-19, with higher mortality rates than the highlands. Fatigue was reported in 53.2% of the patients, followed by headache (43%), dry cough (41.7%), ageusia (37.1%) and anosmia (36.1%). Conclusion: We present the first analysis of the burden of COVID-19 in Ecuador. Our findings show that men are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than women, and risk increases with age and the presence of comorbidities. We also found that blue-collar workers and the unemployed are at greater risk of dying. These early observations offer clinical insights for the medical community to help improve patient care and for public health officials to strengthen Ecuador s response to the outbreak.

However, the similarity between features of CXR images of COVID-19 and pneumonia caused by other infections make the differential diagnosis by radiologists challenging. We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we were able to successfully implement our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images. We propose that our COVID-Classifier can be used in conjunction with other tests for optimal allocation of hospital resources by rapid triage of non-COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abolfazl Zargari Khuzani","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA abzargar@ucsc.edu"},{"author_name":"Morteza Heidari","author_inst":"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK"},{"author_name":"Ali Shariati","author_inst":"Department of Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA"},{"author_name":"Alejandra Barreto","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Carla Moyano","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Arcos","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Vasconez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Clara Paz","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Simbana-Guaycha","author_inst":"Scientific Association of Medical Students, Universidad Central del Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Martin Molestina-Luzuriaga","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Raul Fernandez-Naranjo","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"javier Feijoo","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Aquiles Rodrigo Henriquez","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Lila Adana","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"Andres Lopez-Cortes Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad UTE"},{"author_name":"Isabel Fletcher","author_inst":"London school of hygiene and tropical medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel Lowe","author_inst":"London school of hygiene and tropical medicine"},{"author_name":"Lenin Gomez-Barreno","author_inst":"Universidad de las Americas"},{"author_name":"David Joseph","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guy Williams","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karen Thomas","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Faisal Masud","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christina Talley","author_inst":"Academic Office of Clinical Trials, Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katharine G.
