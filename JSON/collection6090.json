Here we show that there is a distinct correlation between the mortality level and the infection level across countries, which can explain the mortality levels for a wide spectrum of countries. This implies that the number of deaths per 100 infected individuals is approximately the same across diverse countries and can be estimated from the slope of the mortality level-infection level plot. The correlation presented here can potentially be combined with estimates of infection spread to forecast future mortality levels and therefore future needs in terms of healthcare and other resources. Tracking of an individual locations temporal path on this plot can potentially serve as a visual assessment of the nature of the epidemic. Methods presented here are not specific to the current epidemic. This is a preliminary report and uses data from a single source at a single time-point to demonstrate the capability of such an analysis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mugdha Gadgil","author_inst":"National Chemical Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Chetan Gadgil","author_inst":"National Chemical Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087411","rel_title":"COVID-19 Related Mortality: Is the BCG Vaccine Truly Effective?","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087411","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a worldwide emergency. In the attempt to search for interventions that would improve outcomes, some researchers have looked at the potential benefit of BCG vaccination. These early studies have found a statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 related mortality in countries with a current universal bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination policy; partially explained by induced heterologous immunity. However, just as the authors themselves noted, the nature of ecological studies make them very prone to the presence of several confounders. This paper tries to answer the question as to whether a statistically significant difference in mortality rates exists between countries with differing BCG vaccination policies; while being the first to try to account for most of these confounders. We compared the number of COVID-19 related deaths per 1 million inhabitants as well as the number of deaths at the time the countries hit the 1000th COVID-19 case. Countries were divided in those which never had a BCG vaccination policy, those with a prior vaccination policy and those with a current vaccination policy. All data was gathered from publicly available sources. It was found that no statistically significant difference exists in mortality rates between countries with differing BCG vaccination policies. This result seems to reflect the notion that heterologous immunity fades with time after administration. Nevertheless, the immunostimulatory potential of the BCG vaccine might still prove useful in the development of future vaccines or other prophylactic measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan Alberto Paredes Mogica","author_inst":"Anahuac University"},{"author_name":"Valeria Nava","author_inst":"Anahuac University"},{"author_name":"Julian Torres","author_inst":"Central Military Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087403","rel_title":"Who is more susceptible to Covid-19 infection and mortality in the States?","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087403","rel_abs":"Background: A novel coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China and reported to WHO on 31 December 2019. WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. The first case in the US was reported in January 2020. Since mid-March 2020, the number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially in the States, with 1.1 million confirmed cases, and 57.4 thousand deaths as of 30 April 2020. Even though some believe that this new lethal coronavirus does not show any partiality to the rich, previous epidemiological studies find that the poor in the US are more susceptible to the epidemics due to their limited access to preventive measures and crowded living conditions. In this study, we postulate that the rich is more susceptible to Covid-19 infection during the early stage before social distancing measures have been introduced. This may be attributed to the higher mobility (both inter- and intra-city), given their higher tendency to travel for business\/education, and to more social interactions. However, we postulate after the lockdown\/social distancing has been imposed, the infection among the rich may be reduced due to better living conditions. Further, the rich may be able to afford better medical treatment once infected, hence a relatively lower mortality. In contrast, without proper medical insurance coverage, the poor may be prevented from receiving timely and proper medical treatment, hence a higher mortality. Method: We will collect the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US during the period of Jan 2020 to Apr 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, also the number of Covid-19 tests in the US from the health departments across the States. County-level socio-economic status (SES) including age, sex, race\/ethnicity, income, education, occupation, employment status, immigration status, and housing price, will be collected from the US Census Bureau. State\/county-level health conditions including the prevalence of chronic diseases will be collected from the US CDC. State\/county-level movement data including international and domestic flights will be collected from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. We will also collect the periods of lockdown\/social distancing. Regression models are constructed to examine the relationship between SES, and Covid-19 infection and mortality at the state\/county-level before and after lockdown\/social distancing, while accounting for Covid-19 testing capacities and co-morbidities. Expected Findings: We expect that there is a positive correlation between Covid-19 infection and SES at the state\/county-level in the US before social distancing. In addition, we expect a negative correlation between Covid-19 mortality and SES.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Han","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Victor O.K.

In the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul (population 11.3 million), we are carrying out fortnightly household surveys in nine of the largest cities. Multi-stage probability sampling was used in each city to select 500 households, within which one resident was randomly chosen for testing. The Wondfo lateral flow rapid test for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been validated in four different settings, including our own, with pooled estimates of sensitivity (84.8%, 95% CI 81.4%;87.8%) and specificity (99.0%, 95% CI 97.8%;99.7%), which are within the acceptable range for epidemiological studies. In the first wave of the study (April 11-13), 4,188 subjects were tested, of whom two were positive (0.0477%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0058%;0.1724%). In the second round (Apr 25-27) there were six positive subjects (0.1333%; 95% CI 0.0489%;0.2900%). We also tested family members of positive index cases, and nine out of 19 had positive results. Testing of reported COVID-19 cases according to RT-PCR confirmed that the test was highly sensitive under field conditions. The epidemic is at an early stage in the State, as the first case was reported on Feb 28, and by Apr 30, 50 deaths were registered. Strict lockdown measures were implemented in mid-March, and our results suggest that compliance was high, with full or near full compliance rates of 79.4% in the first and 71.7% in the second round. As far as we know, this is the only large population anywhere undergoing regular household serological surveys for COVID-19. The results show that the epidemic is at an early phase, and findings from the next rounds will allow us to document time trends and propose Public Health measures.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariangela Silveira","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Aluisio Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Horta","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Lucia Pellanda","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Victora","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Odir Dellagostin","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Claudio Struchiner","author_inst":"UERJ"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Burattini","author_inst":"UNIFESP"},{"author_name":"Andreia Valim","author_inst":"UNISC"},{"author_name":"Evelise Berlezi","author_inst":"UNIJUI"},{"author_name":"Jeovany Mesa","author_inst":"IMED"},{"author_name":"Maria Leticia Ikeda","author_inst":"UNISINOS"},{"author_name":"Marilia Mesenburg","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Marina Mantesso","author_inst":"UCS"},{"author_name":"Marinel Dall'Agnol","author_inst":"UFSM"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087254","rel_title":"Fully automatic deep convolutional approaches for the analysis of Covid-19 using chest X-ray images","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087254","rel_abs":"Covid-19 is a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In this work, we propose complementary fully automatic approaches for the classification of chest X-ray images under the analysis of 3 different categories: Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. Given the similarity between the pathological impact in the lungs between Covid-19 and pneumonia, mainly during the initial stages of both lung diseases, we performed an exhaustive study of differentiation considering different pathological scenarios. To face these classification tasks, we exploited and adapted to this topic a densely convolutional network architecture, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. To validate the designed approaches, several representative experiments were performed using images retrieved from different public chest X-ray images datasets. Overall, satisfactory results were obtained from the designed experiments, facilitating the doctors' work and allowing better an early diagnostic\/screening and treatment of this relevant pandemic pathology.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joaquim de Moura","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Jorge Novo","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Marcos Ortega","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Lucia Pellanda","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Victora","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Odir Dellagostin","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Claudio Struchiner","author_inst":"UERJ"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Burattini","author_inst":"UNIFESP"},{"author_name":"Andreia Valim","author_inst":"UNISC"},{"author_name":"Evelise Berlezi","author_inst":"UNIJUI"},{"author_name":"Jeovany Mesa","author_inst":"IMED"},{"author_name":"Maria Leticia Ikeda","author_inst":"UNISINOS"},{"author_name":"Marilia Mesenburg","author_inst":"UFCSPA"},{"author_name":"Marina Mantesso","author_inst":"UCS"},{"author_name":"Marinel Dall'Agnol","author_inst":"UFSM"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087304","rel_title":"Sinus and Anterior Skull Base Surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: Systematic review, Synthesis and YO-IFOS position.","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087304","rel_abs":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant confusion about healthcare providers and patients pandemic-specific risks related to surgery. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recommendations for sinus and anterior skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PubMed\/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Embase were searched by two independent otolaryngologists from the Young Otolaryngologists of IFOS (YO-IFOS) for studies dealing with sinus and skull base surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. The review also included unpublished guidelines edited by Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or Neurosurgery societies. Perioperative factors were investigated including surgical indications, preoperative testing of patients, practical management in operating rooms, technical aspects of surgery and postoperative management. The literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The criteria for considering studies or guidelines for the review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework. Results: 15 international publications met inclusion criteria. Five references were guidelines from national societies. All guidelines recommended postponing elective surgeries. An algorithm is proposed that classifies endonasal surgical procedures into three groups based on the risk of postponing surgery. Patients COVID-19 status should be preoperatively assessed. Highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended, and the use of high-speed powered devices should be avoided. Face-to-face postoperative visits must be limited. Conclusions: Sinus and skull base surgeries are high-risk procedures due to potential aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Protection of health care workers by decreasing exposure and optimizing use of PPE is essential with sinus and anterior skull base surgery.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"thomas radulesco","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome R Lechien","author_inst":"Department of Human Anatomy and Experimental Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, UMONS Research Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, University of Mons (UMo"},{"author_name":"Leigh Sowerby","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."},{"author_name":"sven saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Carlos Chiesa-estomba","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain"},{"author_name":"Zoukaa Sargi","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Philippe Lavigne","author_inst":"Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Christian Calvo-Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela-Spain"},{"author_name":"Chwee Ming Lim","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School.

It is suggested that potential acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 from prior exposure may be determined by detecting the presence of circulating IgG antibodies against viral antigens, such as the spike glycoprotein and its receptor binding domain (RBD). Testing our asymptomatic population for evidence of COVID-19 immunity would also offer valuable epidemiologic data to aid health care policies and health care management. Currently, there are over 100 antibody tests that are being used around the world without approval from the FDA or similar regulatory bodies, and they are mostly for rapid and qualitative assessment, with different degrees of error rates. ELISA-based testing for sensitive and rigorous quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can potentially offer mechanistic insights into the COVID-19 disease and aid communities uniquely challenged by limited financial resources and access to commercial testing products. Employing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and spike protein generated in the laboratory, we devised a quantitative ELISA for the detection of circulating serum antibodies. Serum from twenty SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients were used to detect circulating IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD. Quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to the spike glycoprotein or the RBD in patient samples was not always associated with faster recovery, compared to patients with borderline antibody response to the RBD. One patient who did not develop antibodies to the RBD completely recovered from COVID-19. In surveying 99 healthy donor samples (procured between 2017-February 2020), we detected RBD antibodies in one donor from February 2020 collection with three others exhibiting antibodies to the spike protein but not the RBD. Collectively, our study suggests that more rigorous and quantitative analysis, employing large scale sample sets, is required to determine whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD is associated with protection from COVID-19 disease. It is also conceivable that humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD works in association with adaptive T cell response to determine clinical sequela and severity of COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathleen M McAndrews","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dara P Dowlatshahi","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Janine Hensel","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Luis L Ostrosky-Zeichner","author_inst":"Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Papanna","author_inst":"UT Medical School at Houston"},{"author_name":"Valerie S LeBleu","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Raghu Kalluri","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Christian Calvo-Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela-Spain"},{"author_name":"Chwee Ming Lim","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School.

Archived serum (n=34), serum from nucleic acid test (NAT)-positive subjects (n=4), and samples collected from NAT-positive community members (n=4) served to validate the assay. The range of anti-SARS\/CoV-2 antibodies in archived and NAT-positive sera indicated need to compromise sensitivity or specificity. Accordingly, we set a cutoff of 4 SD above the mean for IgG and 3 SD above the mean for IgM to indicate that an individual had been exposed, and developed some degree of immunity, to SARS\/CoV-2. The IgG cutoff clearly compromised sensitivity but offered high specificity, both of which were harder to gauge for IgM. Based on these cutoffs, excluding subjects whose participation resulted from self-suspected SARS\/CoV-2 infection, we found 7.1% positivity for anti-SARS\/CoV-2 IgG (3 of 127 subjects) or IgM (6 of 127). While we do not claim this small immune survey is broadly representative of metro Atlanta, and we have greater confidence in the IgG results, which had only 2.4% positivity, it nonetheless demonstrates that persons with antibodies to SARS\/CoV-2, who've not suspected they'd been exposed to this virus, can readily be found in various Atlanta area neighborhoods (9 positives were in 8 zip codes). Accordingly, these results support the notion that dissemination of the virus is more widespread than testing would indicate but also suggests that most persons in metro Atlanta remain vulnerable to this virus. More generally, these results support the general utility of sero-surveillance to guide public policy but also highlight the difficulty of discerning if individuals have immunity to SARS\/CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Zou","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Alexis Bretin","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Gewirtz","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Luis L Ostrosky-Zeichner","author_inst":"Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Papanna","author_inst":"UT Medical School at Houston"},{"author_name":"Valerie S LeBleu","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Raghu Kalluri","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Christian Calvo-Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela-Spain"},{"author_name":"Chwee Ming Lim","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School.

This fact is supported by the concept of beneficial non specific effect of this live vaccine associated to its interaction with the immune system. Our study aims to identify the correlation between the universal BCG vaccination policy and the mortality attributed to COVID-19. Methods : We conducted an epidemiological study in which we collected COVID-19 pandemic data of April 11th, 2020 from the web site worldometers.info . The exclusion criteria for our study were a number of inhabitants less than one million, low-income countries according to the World Bank classification, a total number of infection cases less than 500 and countries that have performed less than one hundred tests per million inhabitants. Results : Countries that never had universal BCG vaccination policy have a higher mortality (correlated to performed diagnostic tests) attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001). We found that the year of introduction of vaccination influenced significantly the mortality. Countries that started immunization policy before 1960 had more favorable results (p=0.049). For countries that started the BCG vaccination after 1960, countries with current policies have lower mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection than countries that have stopped immunization (p=0.047). Conclusions : Countries that have a BCG vaccination policy have a lower mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The populations of countries that applied this immunization before 1960 are more protected even if this universal policy has been interrupted.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yassine Ouanes","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis"},{"author_name":"Mokhtar Bibi","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Nesrine Baradai","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Marouane Boukhris","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kays Chaker","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Aziz Kacem","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Houcem Hedhli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kheireddine Mrad Deli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Sellami","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Sami Ben Rhouma","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Yassine Nouira","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Head and Surgery Gubbio-Gualdo Tadino Hospital, USL Umbria 1, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fakhry","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Justin Michel","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087429","rel_title":"Statistical Properties of Stepped Wedge Cluster-Randomized Trials in Infectious Disease Outbreaks","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087429","rel_abs":"Randomized controlled trials are crucial for the evaluation of interventions such as vaccinations, but the design and analysis of these studies during infectious disease outbreaks is complicated by statistical, ethical, and logistical factors. Attempts to resolve these complexities have led to the proposal of a variety of trial designs, including individual randomization and several types of cluster randomization designs: parallel-arm, ring vaccination, and stepped wedge designs. Because of the strong time trends present in infectious disease incidence, however, methods generally used to analyze stepped wedge trials may not perform well in these settings. Using simulated outbreaks, we evaluate various designs and analysis methods, including recently proposed methods for analyzing stepped wedge trials, to determine the statistical properties of these methods. While new methods for analyzing stepped wedge trials can provide some improvement over previous methods, we find that they still lag behind parallel-arm cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials in achieving adequate power to detect intervention effects. We also find that these methods are highly sensitive to the weighting of effect estimates across time periods. Despite the value of new methods, stepped wedge trials still have statistical disadvantages compared to other trial designs in epidemic settings.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lee Kennedy-Shaffer","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Integrating available knowledge, we hypothesised that vitamin D status could play a causal role in COVID-19 outcomes. Objectives: We set out to analyse the relationship between COVID-19 severity and latitude, and construct a causal inference framework to validate this hypothesis. Methods: We analysed global daily reports of fatalities and recoveries from 239 locations from 22nd Jan 2020 to 9th April 2020. We quantified local COVID-19 outbreak severity to clearly distinguish the latitude relationship and identify any outliers breaking this pattern, and analysed the timeline of spread. We then used a causal inference framework to distinguish correlation from cause using observational data with a hypothetico-deductive method of proof. We constructed two contrasting directed acyclic graph (DAG) models, one causal and one acausal with respect to vitamin D and COVID-19 severity, allowing us to make 19 verifiable and falsifiable predictions for each. Results: Our analysis confirmed a striking correlation between COVID-19 severity and latitude, and ruled out the temporal spread of infection as an explanation. We compared observed severity for 239 locations with our contrasting model. In the causal model, 16 predictions matched observed data and 3 predictions were untestable; in the acausal model, 14 predictions strongly contradicted observed data, 2 appeared to contradict data, and 3 were untestable. Discussion: We show in advance of RCTs that observed data strongly match predictions made by the causal model but contradict those of the acausal model. We present historic evidence that vitamin D supplementation prevented past respiratory virus pandemics. We discuss how molecular mechanisms of vitamin D action can prevent respiratory viral infections and protect against ARDS. We highlight vitamin D's direct effect on the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS), which in concert with additional effects, can modify host responses thus preventing a cytokine storm and SARS-CoV-2-induced pathological changes. Emerging clinical research confirms striking correlations between hypovitaminosis D and COVID-19 severity, in full alignment with our study. Conclusions: Our novel causal inference analysis of global data verifies that vitamin D status plays a key role in COVID-19 outcomes. The data set size, supporting historical, biomolecular, and emerging clinical research evidence altogether suggest that a very high level of confidence is justified. Vitamin D prophylaxis potentially offers a widely available, low-risk, highly-scalable, and cost-effective pandemic management strategy including the mitigation of local outbreaks and a second wave. Timely implementation of vitamin D supplementation programmes worldwide is critical with initial priority given to those who are at the highest risk, including the elderly, immobile, homebound, BAME and healthcare professionals. Population-wide vitamin D sufficiency could also prevent seasonal respiratory epidemics, decrease our dependence on pharmaceutical solutions, reduce hospitalisations, and thus greatly lower healthcare costs while significantly increasing quality of life.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gareth Davies","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Attila R Garami","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Joanna C Byers","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Matthew Murrill","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Basu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Nathan C Lo","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Houcem Hedhli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kheireddine Mrad Deli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Sellami","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Sami Ben Rhouma","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Yassine Nouira","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Head and Surgery Gubbio-Gualdo Tadino Hospital, USL Umbria 1, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fakhry","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Justin Michel","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087569","rel_title":"Buying time: an ecological survival analysis of COVID-19 spread based on the gravity model","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087569","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has spread in a matter of months to most countries in the world. Various social and economic factors determine the time in which a pandemic reaches a country. This time is essential, because it allows countries to prepare their response. This study considered a gravity model that expressed time to first case as a function of multiple socio-economic factors. First, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed by comparing upper and lower half values of each variable in the model. In order to measure the effect of these variables on time to first case, parameters of the gravity model were estimated using accelerated failure time (AFT) survival analysis. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis the differences between high and low value groups were significant for every variable except population. The AFT analysis determined that increased personal freedom had the largest effect on lowering the survival time, controlling for detection capacity. Higher GDP per capita and a larger population also reduced survival time, while a greater distance from the outbreak source increased it. Understanding the influence of factors affecting time to index case can help us understand disease spread in the early stages of a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alon Vigdorovits","author_inst":"Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Attila R Garami","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Joanna C Byers","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Matthew Murrill","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Basu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Nathan C Lo","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Houcem Hedhli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kheireddine Mrad Deli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Sellami","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Sami Ben Rhouma","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Yassine Nouira","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Head and Surgery Gubbio-Gualdo Tadino Hospital, USL Umbria 1, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fakhry","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Justin Michel","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087791","rel_title":"Did elderly people living in small towns or rural areas suffer heavier disease burden during the COVID-19 epidemic?","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087791","rel_abs":"Objectives: Health inequalities were often exacerbated during the emerging epidemic. This study examined urban and non-urban inequalities in health services among COVID-19 patients aged 65 or above in US Florida from March 2 to May 27, 2020. Methods: A retrospective time series analysis was conducted using individual patient records. Multivariable Poisson and logistic models were used to calculate adjusted incidence of COVID-19 and the associated rates of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Results: As of May 27, 2020, there were 13,659 elderly COVID-19 patients (people aged 65 or above) in Florida and 14.9% of them died. Elderly people living in small metropolitan areas might be less likely to be confirmed with COVID-19 infection than those living in large metropolitan areas. The ED visit and hospitalization rates decreased significantly across metropolitan statuses for both men and women. Those patients living in small metropolitan or rural areas were less likely to be hospitalized than those living in large metropolitan areas (35% and 34% versus 41%). Elderly women aged 75 or above living in rural areas had 113% higher adjusted incidence of COVID-19 than those living in large metropolitan areas, and the rates of hospitalizations were lower compared with those counterparts living in large metropolitan areas (29% versus 46%; OR: 0.37 [0.25-0.54]; p <0.001). Conclusions: For elderly people living in US Florida, those who living in small metropolitan or rural areas were less likely to receive adequate health care than those who living in large or medium metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhua Yu","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Attila R Garami","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Joanna C Byers","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Matthew Murrill","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Basu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Nathan C Lo","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Houcem Hedhli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kheireddine Mrad Deli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Sellami","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Sami Ben Rhouma","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Yassine Nouira","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Head and Surgery Gubbio-Gualdo Tadino Hospital, USL Umbria 1, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fakhry","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Justin Michel","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087833","rel_title":"Early Evidence of Disparities in COVID-19 Testing in US Cities","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087833","rel_abs":"Background: Preliminary evidence has shown wide inequities in COVID-19 related deaths in the US. We explored the emergence of spatial inequities in COVID-19 testing, positivity, and incidence in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Methods: We used zip code-level data on cumulative tests and confirmed cases by date for each city and computed testing, positivity, and incidence indicators. We linked these to 2014-2018 American Community Survey data on income, education, race\/ethnicity, occupation, health insurance, and overcrowding, and computed a summary index. We computed associations between using Poisson models. We also examined clusters of high and low incidence using the G* statistic. Results: Through May 18th, there were wide inequities in positivity and incidence, with less advantaged neighborhoods having a higher incidence (RR=1.36 [95% CrI 1.18;1.57], 1.17 [1.11;1.23], and 1.10 [0.98;1.23], per 1 SD increase in the summary index in Chicago, NYC and Philadelphia, respectively). In all three cities inequities in incidence increased as the pandemic advanced, while inequities in positivity remained stable. In contrast the social patterning of testing changed over time: testing was inversely associated with disadvantage early in the pandemic but was either not associated or positively associated with disadvantage later in the pandemic. We also found clusters of high and low incidence, co-located with areas of high and low disadvantage. Conclusions: We found wide spatial inequities in COVID-19 positivity and incidence in three large metropolitan areas of the US. In health crises health inequities become magnified and reflect a longstanding history of racial and economic injustice.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Usama Bilal","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Sharrelle Barber","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Ana V Diez-Roux","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Murrill","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Basu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Nathan C Lo","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Houcem Hedhli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Kheireddine Mrad Deli","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Sellami","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Sami Ben Rhouma","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Yassine Nouira","author_inst":"University of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology Head and Surgery Gubbio-Gualdo Tadino Hospital, USL Umbria 1, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fakhry","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."},{"author_name":"Justin Michel","author_inst":"APHM, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, La Conception University Hospital, 13385 Marseille Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Raqueli Bittencourt","author_inst":"SMS\/Uruguaiana"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Menezes","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087460","rel_title":"Prediction of Spreads of COVID-19 in India from Current Trend","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087460","rel_abs":"The article describe modelling efforts for evaluating the current level of COVID-19 infections in India, using exponential model.

This is modelled by assuming an initial higher infections, keeping rise rate same. The sudden outbursts are captured using offset of values for these three states. Data from other states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are also analysed and they are found to be following the same constants as India is following. Worldwide, many attempts are made to predict outburst of COVID-19 and in the model, described in this paper, turning point is not predicted, as cases in India are still rising. The developed model is based on daily confirmed infections and not on cumulative infections and rationalization is carried out for the population of various regions, while predicting infections for various states. Assigning a decay constant at this stage will be a premature exercise and keeping that in mind, exponential model predicts that India will attain 1 lakh case by 15 May 2020.

SARS-CoV 2 is highly transmissible and the rate of infection is exponential for heavily infected countries. Asymptotic carriers and longer incubation period have been key towards such a large-scale distribution of disease. Data released by official authorities on COVID-19 cases is significantly affected by various factors such as size of sample, incubation period of disease and time taken to test the sample. These factors mask the useful pattern (signal) of disease spread. Thus, an ingenious method to group data into cycles of five and seven days, for studying pattern of disease spread is undertaken. Occurrence of recurrent peaks as indicated by Adjusted Rate of infection per day indicated the spread of disease has been non-uniform. Currently, India is yet to reach the critical point (peak of epidemic) with adjusted daily cases more than 1000. Increasing testing capacity along with random sampling and sample pooling can help in preventing formation of these peaks in future.

With a relatively high case fatality ratio and limited testing capacity, the number of confirmed cases reported is suspected to suffer from significant under-reporting. Therefore, understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and assessing the effectiveness of the interventions that have taken place in Iran while accounting for the uncertain level of underreporting is of critical importance. We use a mathematical epidemic model utilizing official confirmed data and estimates of underreporting to understand how transmission in Iran has been changing between February and April 2020. METHODS: We developed a compartmental transmission model to estimate the effective reproduction number and its fluctuations since the beginning of the outbreak in Iran. We associate the variations in the effective reproduction number with a timeline of interventions and national events. The estimation method also accounts for the underreporting due to low case ascertainment by estimating the percentage of symptomatic cases using delay adjusted case fatality ratio based on the distribution of the delay from hospitalization to death. FINDINGS: Our estimates of the effective reproduction number ranged from 0.66 to 1.73 between February and April 2020, with a median of 1.16. We estimate a reduction in the effective reproduction number during this period, from 1.73 (95% CI 1.60-1.87) on 1 March 2020 to 0.69 (95% CI 0.68-0.70) on 15 April 2020, due to various non-pharmaceutical interventions including school closures, a ban on public gatherings including sports and religious events, and full or partial closure of non-essential businesses. Based on these estimates and given that a near complete containment is no longer feasible, it is likely that the outbreak may continue until the end of the 2020 if the current level of physical distancing and interventions continue and no effective vaccination or therapeutic are developed and made widely available. INTERPRETATION: The series of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the public compliance that took place in Iran are found to be effective in slowing down the speed of the spread of COVID-19 within the studied time period. However, we argue that if the impact of underreporting is overlooked, the estimated transmission and control dynamics could mislead the public health decisions, policy makers, and general public especially in the earlier stages of the outbreak.

Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%.

Using the most recent report from National Records Scotland (NRS) on 29 April 2020, we examined the percentage difference in crude numbers of deaths in 2020 compared to the average for 2015-2019 by week of death within calendar year. To determine if trends were similar, suggesting underreporting\/underdiagnosed COVID-19 related deaths, we also looked at the trends in % differences for cardiovascular disease deaths. From the first 17 weeks' of data, we found a peak in excess deaths between weeks 14 of 2020, about four weeks after the first case in Scotland was detected on 1 March 2020-- but by week 17 these excesses had diminished around the time lockdown in the UK began. Similar observations were seen for cardiovascular disease-related deaths. These observations suggest that the short-term increase in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths might be associated with undetected\/unconfirmed deaths related to COVID-19. Both of these conditions make patients more susceptible to infection and lack of widespread access to testing for COVID-19 are likely to have resulted in under-estimation of COVID-19 mortality. These data further suggest that the cumulative toll of COVID-19 on mortality is likely undercounted. More detailed analysis is needed to determine if these excesses were directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. Disease specific mortality will need constant monitoring for the foreseeable future as changes occur in increasing capacity and access to testing, reporting criteria, changes to health services and different measures are implemented to control the spread of the COVID-19. Multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, national and international collaborations for complementary and population specific data analysis is required to respond and mitigate adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to inform planning for future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul Brennan","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh - Brain Tumour Centre of Excellence; University of Edinburgh - Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences"},{"author_name":"Evropi Theodoratou","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michael Poon","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Karin Purshouse","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Farhat Din","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kai Jin","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ines Mesa-Eguiagaray","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Dunlop","author_inst":"Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Hall","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Cameron","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wild","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie  LM Sudlow","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Pasin Hemachudha","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Artit Krichphiphat","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Rome Buathong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Tanarak Plipat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Thiravat Hemachudha","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0_ng","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087874","rel_title":"Measuring voluntary social distancing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087874","rel_abs":"Staying home and avoiding unnecessary contact is an important part of the effort to contain COVID-19 and limit deaths. Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing, and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals' voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is critical for estimating the transmission dynamics of the pathogen and assessing the impact of policies. We use the variation in policy responses along with smart device data, which measures the amount of time Americans stayed home, to show that there was substantial voluntary avoidance behavior. We disentangle the extent to which observed shifts in behavior are induced by policy and find evidence of a non-trivial voluntary response to local reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, such that around 45 cases in a home county is associated with the same amount of time at home as a stay-at-home order. People responded to the risk of contracting COVID-19 and to policy orders, though the response to policy orders crowds out or displaces a large share of the voluntary response, suggesting that, during early stages of the U.S. outbreak, better compliance with social distancing recommendations could have been achieved with policy crafted to complement voluntary behavior.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youpei Yan","author_inst":"Yale University, School of Forestry and Environmental Studies"},{"author_name":"Amyn A Malik","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Eli P Fenichel","author_inst":"Yale University, School of Forestry and Environmental Studies"},{"author_name":"Chandra Couzens","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Kai Jin","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ines Mesa-Eguiagaray","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Dunlop","author_inst":"Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Hall","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Cameron","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wild","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie  LM Sudlow","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Pasin Hemachudha","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Artit Krichphiphat","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Rome Buathong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Tanarak Plipat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Thiravat Hemachudha","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087783","rel_title":"Now casting and Forecasting of COVID-19 outbreak in the National Capital Region of Delhi","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087783","rel_abs":"Objectives: The study aimed to estimate the disease burden due to COVID-19 in the scenarios of unchecked spread and with various public health interventions in New Delhi. Methods: We adopted Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate the course of COVID-19 outbreak in Delhi population and effect of public health intervention on the pandemic. We first estimated the basic reproductive rate (R0) based on the evidence from Wuhan, then ran the model considering no intervention implemented, followed by case isolation, social distancing, and lockdown, each implemented in isolation and in combinations to estimate the number of cases. Markov model was used to estimate the number of cases in various clinical scenarios of the disease. Sensitivity analysis conducted to estimate the effect of asymptomatic cases on case based interventions. Results: Estimated R0 in Delhi population was 6.18 (range 4.15 to 12.2). Effective reproductive rate (Rt) was least for case isolation (3.5). Lockdown showed highest reduction (28%) in number of prevalent cases on peak day and 22% reduction in patients in need of intensive care unit (ICU). Case isolation and lockdown together resulted in 50% reduction in number of prevalent cases and 42% reduction in patients in need of ICU care. Sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of case isolation was inversely proportionate to the proportion of asymptomatic (hidden) cases. Conclusions: Interventions should be implemented in combinations of individual and community level interventions to gain better outcome. Identifying and isolation of all cases as early as possible is important to flatten the pandemic curve.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bharathnag Nagappa","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Manikandanesan Sakthivel","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yamini Marimuthu","author_inst":"Maulana Azad Medical College"},{"author_name":"Aayushi Rastogi","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Archana Ramalingam","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Kai Jin","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ines Mesa-Eguiagaray","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Dunlop","author_inst":"Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Hall","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Cameron","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah Wild","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie  LM Sudlow","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Pasin Hemachudha","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Artit Krichphiphat","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Rome Buathong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Tanarak Plipat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Thiravat Hemachudha","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087494","rel_title":"COVID-19 AND PATIENTS UNDERGOING PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS FOR IMMUNE-MEDIATED INFLAMMATORY DISEASES: PROTOCOL FOR A RAPID LIVING SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087494","rel_abs":"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: We propose to systematically review the available evidence to evaluate if patients with immune mediated inflammatory diseases under pharmacological treatment with immunosuppressants, immunobiologics, Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARDs have better or worse outcomes when infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

With rapidly evolving demands on healthcare resources, it is imperative that healthcare systems have the ability to access real-time local data to predict, plan, and effectively manage resources. Objective: To develop an interactive COVID-19 Utilization and Resource Visualization Engine (CURVE) as a data visualization tool to inform decision making and guide a large health system's proactive pandemic response. Methods: We designed and implemented CURVE using R Shiny to display real-time parameters of healthcare utilization at Atrium Health with projections based upon locally derived models for the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the CURVE app to compare predictions from two of our models: one created before and one after the statewide stay-at-home and social distancing orders (denoted before- and after-SAH-order model). We established parameter settings for best-, moderate-, and worst-case scenarios for pandemic spread and resource use, leveraging two locally developed forecasting models to determine peak date trajectory, resource use, and root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted results. Results: CURVE predicts and monitors utilization of hospital beds, ICU beds, and number of ventilators in the context of up-to-date local resources and provides Atrium Health leadership with timely, actionable insights to guide decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. The after-SAH-order model demonstrated the lowest RMSE in total bed, ICU bed, and patients on ventilators. Conclusions: CURVE provides a powerful, interactive interface that provides locally relevant, dynamic, timely information to guide health system decision making and pandemic preparedness.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shih-Hsiung Chou","author_inst":"Atrium Health"},{"author_name":"James T.

However, these measures are not without cost, and careful analysis is critical to quantify their impact on disease spread and guide future initiatives. This study aims to measure the impact of NPIs on the effective reproductive number (Rt) and other COVID-19 outcomes in U.S. states. Methods: In order to standardize the stage of disease spread in each state, this study analyzes the weeks immediately after each state reached 500 cases. The primary outcomes were average Rt in the week following 500 cases and doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases. Linear and logistic regressions were performed in R to assess the impact of various NPIs while controlling for population density, GDP, and certain health metrics. This analysis was repeated for deaths with doubling time from 50 to 100 deaths and included several healthcare infrastructure control variables. Results: States that had a stay-at-home order in place at the time of their 500th case are associated with lower average Rt the following week compared to states without a stay-at-home order (p < 0.001) and are significantly less likely to have an Rt>1 (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.37, p = 0.004). These states also experienced a significantly longer doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72, p = 0.004). States in the highest quartile of average time spent at home were also slower to reach 1000 cases than those in the lowest quartile (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.53, p = 0.002). Discussion: Few studies have analyzed the effect of statewide stay-at-home orders, school closures, and other social distancing measures in the U.S., which has faced the largest COVID-19 case burden. States with stay-at-home orders have a 93% decrease in the odds of having a positive Rt at a standardized point in disease burden. States that plan to scale back such measures should carefully monitor transmission metrics.

Currently Bronx has the highest prevalence per capita in New York. Objective: To investigate the coagulopathic presentation of COVID and its natural course and to investigate whether hematologic and coagulation parameters can be used to assess illness severity and death. Design: Retrospective case study of positive COVID inpatients between 3\/20\/2020-3\/31\/2020. Setting: Montefiore Health System main hospital, Moses, a large tertiary care center in the Bronx. Participants: Adult inpatients with positive COVID tests hospitalized at MHS. Exposure (for observational studies): Datasets of participants were queried for physiological, demographic (age, sex, socioeconomic status and self-reported race and\/or ethnicity) and laboratory data. Main Outcome and Measures: Relationship and predictive value of measured parameters to mortality and illness severity. Results: Of the 217 in this case review, 70 died during hospitalization while 147 were discharged home. Only the admission PT and first D-Dimer could very significantly differentiate those who were discharged alive and those who died. Logistic regression analysis shows increased odds ratio for mortality by first D-Dimer within 48 hrs. of admission. The optimal cut-point for the initial D-Dimer to predict mortality was found to be 1.65 mcg\/mL. Conclusions: We describe here a comprehensive assessment of hematologic and coagulation parameters in COVID and examine the relationship of these to mortality. We demonstrate that both initial and maximum D-Dimer values are biomarkers that can be used for survival assessments.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morayma Reyes Gil","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jesus D Gonzalez-Lugo","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shafia Rahman","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Barouqa","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Szymnaski","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenji Ikemura","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yungtai Lo","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henny H Billett","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore C Hannah","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alex Gometz","author_inst":"Concussion Management of New York"},{"author_name":"JT Kostman","author_inst":"ProtectedBy.AI"},{"author_name":"Tanvir F Choudhri","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maria Eduarda dos Santos Puga","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Virginia Fernandes Moca Trevisani","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Universidade Santo Amaro"},{"author_name":"Artit Krichphiphat","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Rome Buathong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Tanarak Plipat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, TH"},{"author_name":"Thiravat Hemachudha","author_inst":"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Pedro Hallal","author_inst":"UFPel"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20089045","rel_title":"Anxiety levels among Iranian health care workers during the COVID-19 surge: A cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20089045","rel_abs":"The recent surge in COVID-19 cases has exposed health care workers (HCWs) to a wide range of psychological stressors and predisposed them to anxiety-related disorders.
