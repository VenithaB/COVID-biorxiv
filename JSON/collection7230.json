In particular, the growth rate of the infection has been fitted as an exponential decay, as compared to a linear decay, reported previously. The model has been validated with the data of China and South Korea, where the pandemic is nearing to its end. The data of Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden show that the peak of the infection has reached i.e. a time when the new infections will start to decrease as compared to the previous day. The model predicts the approximate number of total infections at the end of the outbreak. The model prediction of the USA, and Brazil show that the peak will reach in the next two-three weeks. The total number of infections in the USA is estimated to be around 4 million by the model. The reported data of India show the start of disease evolution, with a large initial scatter in the growth rate. The possible peak date and the total number of infections are predicted using the data available.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajneesh Bhardwaj","author_inst":"IIT Bombay"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20062752","rel_title":"Analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in french overseas department Mayotte based on a modified deterministic and stochastic SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20062752","rel_abs":"In order to anticipate a future trends in the development of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic starting early at march 13, in the french overseas department Mayotte, we study in this paper a deterministic and stochastic epidemic model through several possible states: susceptible, exposed, infected including symptomatics and asymptomatics cases, simple or mild removed, severe removed (including hospitalized) and death cases. We first fit the constant transmission rate parameter to the epidemic data in Mayotte during an early exponential growth phase using an algorithm with a package of software R and based on a Likewook Maximum estimator. Thus, after the intervention and control measures imposed by the gouvernement, we introduce a simple temporally varying and exponentially decreasing transmission rate with a control parameter.

This suggests the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 patients is imminent. We find that there is significant regional variation in different regions of the UK and that this is changing over time. Within England currently the reproductive ratio is lowest in the Midlands (1.11 95% CI 1.07; 1.14), and highest in the North East of England (1.38 95% CI 1.33-1.42).

To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County. Methods On April 3-4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a sample of individuals living within the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We estimate weights to adjust our sample to match the zip code, sex, and race\/ethnicity distribution within the county. We report both the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also adjust for test performance characteristics by combining data from 16 independent samples obtained from manufacturer's data, regulatory submissions, and independent evaluations: 13 samples for specificity (3,324 specimens) and 3 samples for sensitivity (157 specimens). Results The raw prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in our sample was 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI 1.1-2.0%). Test performance specificity in our data was 99.5% (95CI 99.2-99.7%) and sensitivity was 82.8% (95CI 76.0-88.4%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test performance characteristics was 1.2% (95CI 0.7-1.8%). After weighting for population demographics of Santa Clara County, the prevalence was 2.8% (95CI 1.3-4.7%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds. These prevalence point estimates imply that 54,000 (95CI 25,000 to 91,000 using weighted prevalence; 23,000 with 95CI 14,000-35,000 using unweighted prevalence) people were infected in Santa Clara County by early April, many more than the approximately 1,000 confirmed cases at the time of the survey. Conclusions The estimated population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection may be much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. More studies are needed to improve precision of prevalence estimates. Locally-derived population prevalence estimates should be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eran Bendavid","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Bianca Mulaney","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Sood","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Soleil Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emilia Ling","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bromley-Dulfano","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cara Lai","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zoe Weissberg","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Saavedra-Walker","author_inst":"Health Education is Power, Inc.,"},{"author_name":"James Tedrow","author_inst":"The Compliance Resource Group, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dona Tversky","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063776","rel_title":"A COVID-19 Risk Assessment for the US Labor Force","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063776","rel_abs":"The consequences of COVID-19 infection varies substantially based on individual social risk factors and predisposing health conditions.

As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines ('lock-downs') to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges. Methods and analysis We will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv for peer-reviewed and pre-print papers on automated or semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations. Studies will be eligible if published in English between 1 January 2000 and 14 April 2020. We will synthesise study findings narratively and will consider meta-analysis if >=3 suitable studies with comparable interventions and outcomes are available. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this review. We plan to disseminate findings via pre-print, journal publication, through social media and web-based platforms and through direct stakeholder engagement.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isobel Braithwaite","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Tom Callender","author_inst":"Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"},{"author_name":"Miriam Bullock","author_inst":"UCL Collaborative Centre for Inclusion Health, University College London"},{"author_name":"Rob Aldridge","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Daszak","author_inst":"EcoHealth Alliance"},{"author_name":"Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio","author_inst":"EcoHealth Alliance"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Zoe Weissberg","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Saavedra-Walker","author_inst":"Health Education is Power, Inc.,"},{"author_name":"James Tedrow","author_inst":"The Compliance Resource Group, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dona Tversky","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061713","rel_title":"The Potential role of Particulate Matter in the Spreading of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: First Evidence-based Research Hypotheses","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061713","rel_abs":"Background: An epidemic model based only on respiratory droplets and close contact could not fully explain the regional differences in the spread of the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 in Italy, which was fast and dramatic only in Lombardy and Po Valley.

In addition to the number of exceedances of PM10 daily limit value, we considered also population data and daily travelling information per each Province. Results. PM10 daily limit value exceedances appear to be a significant predictor (p <0.001) of infection in univariate analyses. Less polluted Provinces had a median of 0.03 infection cases over 1000 residents, while most polluted Provinces had a median of 0.26 cases over 1000 residents. Thirty-nine out of 41 Northern Italian Provinces resulted in the category with highest PM10 levels, while 62 out of 66 Southern Provinces presented low PM10 concentrations (p<0.001). In Milan, the average growth rate before the lockdown was significantly higher than Rome (0.34 vs. 0.27 per day, with a doubling time of 2.0 days vs. 2.6), suggesting a basic reproductive number R0>6.0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonardo Setti","author_inst":"Univerisity of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Passarini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Gianluigi De Gennaro","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Pierluigi Barbieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Perrone","author_inst":"Environmental Research Division, TCR TECORA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piazzalunga","author_inst":"Water & Life Lab Groupe Carso, Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Massimo Borelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Jolanda Palmisani","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Alessia Di Gilio","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063305","rel_title":"Nowcasting and Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 and Healthcare Demand In Turkey, A Modelling Study","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063305","rel_abs":"Background: This study aims to estimate the total number of infected people, evaluate the effects of NPIs on the healthcare system, and predict the expected number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in Turkey. Methods: This study was carried out according to three dimensions. In the first, the actual number of infected people was estimated. In the second, the expected total numbers of infected people, deaths, hospitalizations have been predicted in the case of no intervention. In the third, the distribution of the expected number of infected people and deaths, and ICU and non-ICU bed needs over time has been predicted via a SEIR-based simulator (TURKSAS) in four scenarios. Results: According to the number of deaths, the estimated number of infected people in Turkey on March 21 was 123,030. In the case of no intervention the expected number of infected people is 72,091,595 and deaths is 445,956, the attack rate is 88,1%, and the mortality ratio is 0,54%. The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to be exceeded by 4,4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity by 3,21-fold. In the second and third scenarios compliance with NPIs makes a difference of 94,303 expected deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below Turkey's capacity. Discussion: Predictions show that around 16 million people can be prevented from being infected and 94,000 deaths can be prevented by full compliance with the measures taken.

The early detection of this type of virus will help in relieving the pressure of the healthcare systems. Chest X-rays has been playing a crucial role in the diagnosis of diseases like Pneumonia. As COVID-19 is a type of influenza, it is possible to diagnose using this imaging technique. With rapid development in the area of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning, there had been intelligent systems to classify between Pneumonia and Normal patients. This paper proposes the machine learning-based classification of the extracted deep feature using ResNet152 with COVID-19 and Pneumonia patients on chest X-ray images. SMOTE is used for balancing the imbalanced data points of COVID-19 and Normal patients. This non-invasive and early prediction of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) by analyzing chest X-rays can further be used to predict the spread of the virus in asymptomatic patients. The model is achieving an accuracy of 0.973 on Random Forest and 0.977 using XGBoost predictive classifiers. The establishment of such an approach will be useful to predict the outbreak early, which in turn can aid to control it effectively.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Ridhi Arora","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Vipul Bansal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Vinodh J Sahayasheela","author_inst":"Kyoto University of Advanced Study, Kyoto, Japan"},{"author_name":"Himanshu Buckchash","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Javed Imran","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Narayanan Narayanan","author_inst":"Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ganesh N Pandian","author_inst":"Kyoto University of Advanced Study, Kyoto, Japan"},{"author_name":"Balasubramanian Raman","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063941","rel_title":"Sample-Efficient Deep Learning for COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on CT Scans","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063941","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 1.3 million individuals all over the world and caused more than 106,000 deaths. One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. There have been increasing efforts on developing deep learning methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, these works are difficult to reproduce and adopt since the CT data used in their studies are not publicly available. Besides, these works require a large number of CTs to train accurate diagnosis models, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We build a publicly-available dataset containing hundreds of CT scans positive for COVID-19 and develop sample-efficient deep learning methods that can achieve high diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19 from CT scans even when the number of training CT images are limited. Specifically, we propose an Self-Trans approach, which synergistically integrates contrastive self-supervised learning with transfer learning to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Self-Trans approach compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach achieves an F1 of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans, even though the number of training CTs is just a few hundred.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuehai He","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xingyi Yang","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Shanghang Zhang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Zhao","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Yichen Zhang","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Eric Xing","author_inst":"CMU"},{"author_name":"Pengtao Xie","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ganesh N Pandian","author_inst":"Kyoto University of Advanced Study, Kyoto, Japan"},{"author_name":"Balasubramanian Raman","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, Milan"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bogan","author_inst":"Bogan Associates"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063925","rel_title":"REGIONAL DETERMINANTS OF THE EXPANSION OF COVID-19 IN BRAZIL","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063925","rel_abs":"Objective: This study investigates the regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 in Brazil and its relationship with climatic and demographic factors by use data from February 26 to April 04, 2020.

Markers that could predict patients at risk of poor outcomes would be extremely useful clinically. Evidence has emerged that low lymphocyte count is associated with increased disease severity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between lymphocyte count and severity of SARS-CoV-2 associated clinical disease. Results: Seven papers were included in the meta-analysis. These papers included data from 2083 patients, 25% (n=521) with severe SAR-CoV-2 disease and 75% (n=1562) with non-severe SAR-CoV-2 disease. Heterogenicity was seen in the definition of severe disease. Metanalysis produced metamedians of 1x109\/L (95% CI 1-1.1) and 0.7x109\/L (95% CI 0.63-0.8) lymphocytes for patients with non-severe and severe disease respectively (p-value of p=0.006 Wilcoxon test). Calculation of metamedians from the two papers classifying severe disease according to death alone gave 1.1 1x109\/L lymphocytes (95% CI 1.0-1.1) for \"survivors\" (n=163) and 0.63 1x109\/L lymphocytes (95% CI 0.60-0.63) for \"non-survivors\" (n=253) of SAR-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Lower lymphocyte counts are significantly associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lymphocytopenia may therefore be useful laboratory measure to allow prognostication of patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robin A C Brown","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jane Barnard","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Eva Harris-Skillman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bronwen Harbinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beata Dunne","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Drake","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sophie Roche","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Edward Harris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James Gunnel","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Joshu Frost","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20064253","rel_title":"Population simulations of COVID-19 outbreaks provide tools for risk assessment and continuity planning","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20064253","rel_abs":"Essential industrial sectors, healthcare systems, and government agencies must continue operations despite the risk of COVID-19 infection.

This can lead to the implementation of testing policies that restrict access to COVID-19 tests, and to testing backlogs and delays.

Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. Methods We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in Ile-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. Results We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case-finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. Conclusions As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Di Domenico","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Orange Experience Design Lab"},{"author_name":"Chiara E.

This challenge led to the concept of splitting ventilator between several patients, which aroused interest as well as a strong opposition from multiple professional societies (The joint statement)1.Establishment of a safe ventilator splitting setup which enables monitoring and control of each ventilated patient would be a desirable ability. Achieving independency between the Co-vent patients would enable effective coping with different individual clinical scenarios and broaden the pairing possibilities of patients connected to a single ventilator. We conducted an experiment to determine if our designed setup achieves these goals. Methods: We utilized a double two limbed modified ventilator circuits which were connected to dual lung simulators. Adding readily available pressure sensors (transducers), PEEP valves, flow control valves, one-way (check) valves and HME filters made the circuit safe enough and suitable for our goals. We first examined a single lung simulator establishing the baseline set parameters, while monitoring ventilator measures as Tidal Volume. The initial ventilator setting we chose was a controlled mandatory ventilation mode with a PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) of 25cmH2O, PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) of 5 cmH2O. In pressure control set at 20 cmH2O, the recorded mean TV( tidal volume) was 1000 mL (approximately 500 mL\/lung simulator) with an average MV(minute ventilation) of 13 L\/min (or 6.5 L\/min\/lung simulator). After examining the system with the dual modified circuits attached, and obtaining all the ventilation parameters, we simulated several clinical scenarios. We simulated clinical events such as: partial or full obstruction, disconnection, air leak and compliance differentials, which occur frequently on a ventilation course. Thus, it is a paramount system demand to keep undisturbed ventilation to the Co-vent patient A, while being challenged by patient B. Results: The adaptive split ventilator setup yields increased safety, monitoring, and controls ventilation parameters successfully for each connected simulated patient (using lung simulators).It also enables coping with several common clinical scenarios on a ventilation course, by allowing the care provider to control PIP and PEEP of each Co-Vent patient. Conclusion: In a mass crisis setting, when there is a shortage of ventilators supply, and as a last resort, this setup can be a viable option to act upon. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the split ventilator to ventilate dual lung simulators with increased safety, monitoring and ventilation pressures control of each simulated patient. This split ventilator kept supporting a simulated patient with undisturbed parameters while the CO-vent patient was simulated to be disconnected, having an air leak, or exhibiting lung compliance deterioration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a split ventilator setup demonstrates these capabilities. Our pilot experiment suggests a significant potential of expanding the ventilator support resources, and is especially relevant during COVID-19 outbreak. Since this setup has not been used in a clinical setting yet, further research should be conducted to explore the safety limits and the capabilities of this model.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarit Hadar Shahroor","author_inst":"Hebrew University Hadassah Medical school"},{"author_name":"Yarden Sarouf","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Leav Oz-Ari","author_inst":"Fabric Robotics"},{"author_name":"M Gilad","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064790","rel_title":"How high and long will the COVID-19 wave be?

Most countries have implemented numerous social distancing measures in order to limit its transmission and control the outbreak. This study aims to describe the impact of these control measures on the spread of the disease for Italy and Germany, forecast the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in both countries and estimate the medical capacity requirements in terms of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICUs) for optimal clinical treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients, for the Germany health system. Methods: We used an exponential decline function to model the trajectory of the daily growth rate of infections in Italy and Germany. A linear regression of the logarithmic growth rate functions of different stages allowed to describe the impact of the social distancing measures leading to a faster decline of the growth rate in both countries. We used the linear model to predict the number of diagnosed and fatal COVID-19 cases from April 10th until May 31st. For Germany we estimated the required daily number of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICU) using clinical observations on the average lengths of a hospital stay for the severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Results: Analyzing the data from Germany and Italy allowed us to identify changes in the trajectory of the growth rate of infection most likely resulted from the various social distancing measures implemented. In Italy a stronger decline in the growth rate was observed around the week of March 17th, whereas for Germany the stronger decline occurred approximately a week later (the week of March 23rd). Under the assumption that the impact of the measures will last, the total size of the outbreak can be estimated to 155,000 cases in Germany (range 140,000-180,000) and to 185,000 cases in Italy (range 175,000-200,000). For Germany the total number of deaths until May 31st is calculated to 3,850 (range 3,500-4,450). Based on the projected number of new COVID-19 cases we expect that the hospital capacity requirements for severe and critical cases in Germany will decline from the 2nd week of April onwards from 13,500 to ~2500 hospital beds (range 1500-4300) and from 2500 to ~500 ICU beds in early May (range 300-800). Conclusion: The modeling effort presented here provides a valuable framework to capture the impact of the social distancing measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in European countries and to forecast the future trend of daily COVID-19 cases. It provides a tool for medical authorities in Germany and other countries to help inform the required hospital capacity of the health care system. Germany appears to be in the middle of the (first) COVID-19 outbreak wave and the German health system is well prepared to handle it with the available capacities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Klabunde","author_inst":"Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH"},{"author_name":"Clemens Giegerich","author_inst":"Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH"},{"author_name":"Leav Oz-Ari","author_inst":"Fabric Robotics"},{"author_name":"M Gilad","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061481","rel_title":"AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL TO AID DECISION-MAKING FOR COVID-19 CONTROL IN SRI LANKA","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061481","rel_abs":"Background: Sri Lanka diagnosed its first local case of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020. The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of the health system. Methods: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after lockout. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population exposed; proportion asymptomatic; number of active and recovered cases; infectious period; R0 or doubling time; proportion critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. Results: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0=3.32, 95% CI 1.85 - 5.41) and from Day 18 - 30 (R=1.25, 95%CI: 0.93 - 1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lockout, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days days, signalled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15 - 22) on Day 14 after lockout. Conclusion: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lockout, transmission should not exceed R=1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dileepa S Ediriweera","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Nilanthi R de Silva","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Neelika G Malavige","author_inst":"Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"H Janaka de Silva","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20063008","rel_title":"Prediction of the time evolution of the COVID-19 disease in Guadeloupe with a stochastic evolutionary model","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20063008","rel_abs":"Predictions on the time-evolution of the number of severe and critical cases of COVID-19 patients in Guadeloupe are presented. A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population ({approx} 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID-19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time-evolution of the number of cases follows the well-known exponential-like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so-called basic reproductive number, R0, defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period TI . Because of the rather long duration of infectious period (about 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R0 provided we have R0 < 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital ' s intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R0 < 0.6. For a larger R0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing-down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success. Appendix Posterior model assessment with data acquired after April 11, 2020 added in a second version of the paper compares the model predictions with the data acquired from April 12 to May 25 2020, after the construction of the model discussed in the present study. The remarkable agreement between the model predictions and the data may be explained by the good quality of first-hand data used to constrain the model, the ability of the stochastic approach to integrate new information and stability of the sanitary situation due to the respect of the recommendations emitted by medical and administrative authorities by the guadeloupean population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MERIEM ALLALI","author_inst":"CHU POINTE A PITRE, URGENCES SAMU SMUR"},{"author_name":"PATRICK PORTECOP","author_inst":"CHU POINTE A PITRE, HEAD OF SAMU SMUR UNIT"},{"author_name":"MICHEL CARLES","author_inst":"CHU POINTE A PITRE, HEAD OF CRITICAL CARE DEPARTMENT"},{"author_name":"DOMINIQUE GIBERT","author_inst":"LYON 1 UNIVERSITY OBSERVATORY"},{"author_name":"Joseph k","author_inst":"RAFAEL Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"N Leshem","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Neta Z","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"M Naor","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Amir B","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Rotem L","author_inst":"Rafael Advance Defense Systems"},{"author_name":"Brian Angus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061721","rel_title":"COVID-19-related mortality by age groups in Europe: A meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061721","rel_abs":"Background and Objectives: To date, more than 1,000,000 confirmed cases and 65,000 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported globally. Early data have indicated that older patients are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than younger ones, but precise international estimates of the age-breakdown of COVID-19-related deaths are lacking. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the distribution of COVID-19-related fatalities by age groups in Europe. On April 6, 2020, we systematically reviewed COVID-19-related mortality data from 32 European countries (European Union\/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom). We collated official reports provided by local Public Health or Ministry of Health websites. We included countries if they provided data regarding more than 10 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by age according to pre-specified groups (i.e., < 40, 40-69, [&ge;] 70 years). We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of age groups among all COVID-19-related fatalities. Results: Thirteen European countries were included in the review, for a total of 31,864 COVID-19-related deaths (range: 27-14,381 per country). In the main meta-analysis (including data from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland; 21,522 COVID-19-related fatalities), the summary proportions of persons < 40, 40-69, and [&ge;] 70 years of age among all COVID-19-related deaths were 0.1% (0.0-0.2%; I2 24%), 12.8% (10.3-15.6%; I2 94%), and 84.8% (81.3-88.1%; I2 96%), respectively. Conclusions: People under 40 years of age represent a small fraction of the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Europe. These results may help health authorities respond to public concerns and guide future physical distancing and mitigation strategies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie F.

Meanwhile there were controversies among different studies about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients. Hence, we aimed to study CVD burden among COVID-19 patients, using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in journal websites and Google Scholar. Meta-analyses were carried out for Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for different CVDs. We have also performed a descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs. Results: Fifty-six studies entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and 198 papers for descriptive outcomes, including 159,698 COVID-19 patients. Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 13.29, 95% CI 7.35-24.03), hypertension (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 2.11-3.19), heart Failure (OR: 6.72, 95% CI 3.34-13.52), arrhythmia (OR: 2.75, 95% CI 1.43-5.25), coronary artery disease (OR: 3.78, 95% CI 2.42-5.90), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.89-3.62) were significantly associated with mortality. Arrhythmia (OR: 7.03, 95% CI 2.79-17.69), acute cardiac injury (OR: 15.58, 95% CI 5.15-47.12), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.09-6.26), cardiovascular disease (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.59-6.09), and hypertension (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.41-2.68) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Findings of this study revealed a high burden of CVDs among COVID-19 patients, which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission. Proper management of CVD patients with COVID-19 and monitoring COVID-19 patients for acute cardiac conditions is highly recommended to prevent mortality and critical situations.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amir Shamshirian","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Keyvan Heydari","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Pourali","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Moosazadeh","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saeed Abrotan","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Layla Shojaei","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Sogol Sedighi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nima Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061994","rel_title":"Identifying common pharmacotherapies associated with reduced COVID-19 morbidity using electronic health records","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061994","rel_abs":"Objective: Absent a vaccine or any established treatments for the novel and highly infectious coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), rapid efforts to identify potential therapeutics are required. We sought to identify commonly prescribed medications that may be associated with lesser risk of morbidity with COVID-19 across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using electronic health records from individuals evaluated in the emergency department between March 4, 2020 and July 12, 2020. Setting: Emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals presenting to an emergency department and undergoing COVID-19 testing. Main Outcome or Measure: Inpatient hospitalization; documented requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 7,360 individuals with COVID-19 positive test results by PCR, 3,693 (50.2%) were hospitalized in one of 6 hospitals. In models adjusted for sociodemographic features and overall burden of medical illness, medications significantly associated with diminished risk for hospitalization included ibuprofen and sumatriptan. Among individuals who were hospitalized, 962(26.0%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 608 (16.5%) died; ibuprofen and naproxen were also more commonly prescribed among individuals not requiring intensive care. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that electronic health records may be applied to identify medications associated with lower risk of morbidity with COVID-19, but larger cohorts will be required to address the substantial problem of confounding by indication, such that extreme caution is warranted in interpreting nonrandomized results.

Risk of hospitalization and of death were higher in patients with heart failure (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1and HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2, respectively), arrhythmia (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5, respectively), dementia (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.8 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8, respectively), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.7 and HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5, respectively), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2, respectively), and hypertensions(HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.6 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1, respectively), while COPD increased the risk of hospitalization (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) but not of death (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7). Previous use of ACE inhibitors has no effect on risk of death (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34) Conclusions. The mechanisms underlying these associations are mostly unknown. A deeper understanding of the causal chain from infection, disease onset, and immune response to outcomes may explain how these prognostic factors act.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paolo Giorgi Rossi","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Marino","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Debora Formisano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Venturelli","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Vicentini","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Grilli","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"- The Reggio Emilia COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Layla Shojaei","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Sogol Sedighi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nima Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063529","rel_title":"Impact of population mask wearing on Covid-19 post lockdown","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063529","rel_abs":"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV2 is a rapidly spreading global pandemic. Although precise transmission routes and dynamics are unknown, SARS-CoV2 is thought primarily to spread via contagious respiratory droplets. Unlike with SARS-CoV, maximal viral shedding occurs in the early phase of illness, and this is supported by models that suggest 40-80% of transmission events occur from pre- and asymptomatic individuals. One widely-discussed strategy to limit transmission of SARS-CoV2, particularly from presymptomatic individuals, has been population-level wearing of masks. Modelling for pandemic influenza suggests some benefit in reducing total numbers infected with even 50% mask-use. COVID-19 has a higher hospitalization and mortality rate than influenza, and the impacts on these parameters, and critically, at what point in the pandemic trajectory mask-use might exert maximal benefit are completely unknown. We derived a simplified SIR model to investigate the effects of near-universal mask-use on COVID-19 assuming 8 or 16% mask efficacy. We decided to model, in particular, the impact of masks on numbers of critically-ill patients and cumulative mortality, since these are parameters that are likely to have the most severe consequences in the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas mask use had a relatively minor benefit on critical-care and mortality rates when transmissibility (Reff) was high, the reduction on deaths was dramatic as the effective R approached 1, as might be expected after aggressive social-distancing measures such as wide-spread lockdowns. One major concern with COVID-19 is its potential to overwhelm healthcare infrastructures, even in resource-rich settings, with one third of hospitalized patients requiring critical-care. We incorporated this into our model, increasing death rates for when critical-care resources have been exhausted. Our simple model shows that modest efficacy of masks could avert substantial mortality in this scenario. Importantly, the effects on mortality became hyper-sensitive to mask-wearing as the effective R approaches 1, i.e. near the tipping point of when the infection trajectory is expected to revert to exponential growth, as would be expected after effective lockdown. Our model suggests that mask-wearing might exert maximal benefit as nations plan their post-lockdown strategies and suggests that mask-wearing should be included in further more sophisticated models of the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Babak Javid","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Q Balaban","author_inst":"Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Debora Formisano","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Venturelli","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Vicentini","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Grilli","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Governance, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy"},{"author_name":"- The Reggio Emilia COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Layla Shojaei","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Sogol Sedighi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nima Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Susanne Hodgson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kupiec","author_inst":"ARL BioPharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Daniel Eichner","author_inst":"Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ribhav Gupta","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jay Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20061002","rel_title":"Estimating the Final Epidemic Size for COVID-19 Outbreak using Improved Epidemiological Models","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20061002","rel_abs":"Final epidemic sizes of different geographical regions due to COVID-19 are estimated using logistic, SIR and generalized SEIR models. These models use different parameters which are estimated using non-linear fits from the available data. It is found that both SIR and generalized SEIR models give similar estimations for regions where curves show signs of flattening. A study of these models with data from China indicates that in such cases these estimates may be more reliable. The estimates are presented for the most affected countries due to COVID-19. According to these models, the final epidemic size in the US, Italy, Spain, and Germany could be 0.8, 0.16, 0.18 and 0.14 million respectively.
