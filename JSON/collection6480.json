Many scientific questions about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 were raised and urgently need to be answered, including the susceptibility of animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we tested whether tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical signs were observed in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature (above 39{degrees} C) particular in female animals during infection. Low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups, each of which showed his own characteristics. Histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were mild but the main changes although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues. In summary, tree shrew is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may not be a suitable animal for COVID-19 related researches.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Junbin Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Collegeof"},{"author_name":"Dexuan Kuang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Xu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Mengli Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Ma","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Siwen Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jingmei Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haiting Long","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kaiyun Ding","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiahong Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiansheng Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haixuan Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wenhai Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jing Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yinqiu Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Daoju Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shuaiyao Lu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongqi Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaozhong Peng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.069476","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 selectively mimics a cleavable peptide of human ENaC in a strategic hijack of host proteolytic machinery","rel_date":"2020-04-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.069476","rel_abs":"Molecular mimicry of host proteins is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to evade immune surveillance and exploit host cell systems. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1\/S2 cleavage site (RRARSVAS), absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, that results in mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel -subunit (ENaC-). Genetic truncation at this ENaC- cleavage site causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting the functional importance of the mimicked SARS-CoV-2 peptide. Single cell RNA-seq from 65 studies shows significant overlap between the expression of ENaC- and ACE2, the putative receptor for the virus, in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular fingerprint with amino acid cleavage signatures of 178 human proteases shows the potential for tissue-specific proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. We extrapolate that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global coronavirus pandemic may be in part due to its targeted mimicry of human ENaC and hijack of the associated host proteolytic network.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Praveen Anand","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Murali Aravamudan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Ma","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Siwen Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jingmei Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haiting Long","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kaiyun Ding","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiahong Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiansheng Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haixuan Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wenhai Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jing Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yinqiu Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Daoju Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shuaiyao Lu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongqi Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaozhong Peng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.070771","rel_title":"Origin of imported SARS-CoV-2 strains in The Gambia identified from Whole Genome Sequences.","rel_date":"2020-04-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.070771","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus with high human transmissibility.

Such information can be extremely valuable as it may indicate shifts in aggressiveness, and it could provide useful information to trace the spread of the virus in the population. In this work we identified and traced over time 7 amino acid variants that are present with high frequency in Italy and Europe, but that were absent or present at very low frequencies during the first stages of the epidemic in China and the initial reports in Europe. The analysis of these variants helps defining 6 phylogenetic clades that are currently spreading throughout the world with changes in frequency that are sometimes very fast and dramatic. In the absence of conclusive data at the time of writing, we discuss whether the spread of the variants may be due to a prominent founder effect or if it indicates an adaptive advantage.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Comandatore","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Alice Chiodi","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Paolo Gabrieli","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Gherard Batisti Biffignandi","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Perini","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ricagno","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mascolo","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Greta Petazzoni","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Matteo Ramazzotti","author_inst":"University of Firenze"},{"author_name":"Sara Giordana Rimoldi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Mariarita Gismondo","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Valeria Micheli","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Davide Sassera","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gaiarsa","author_inst":"Policlinico San Matteo Pavia Fondazione IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Claudio Bandi","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Matteo Brilli","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Abdul Karim Sesay","author_inst":"Genomics Core Facility, Lab service, MRCG at LSHTM, Fajara, The Gambia"},{"author_name":"Yinqiu Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Daoju Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shuaiyao Lu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongqi Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaozhong Peng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081695","rel_title":"COVID-19 and depressive symptoms in students before and during lockdown","rel_date":"2020-04-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081695","rel_abs":"The lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic may exacerbate depressive symptoms, experts argue.

Modestly sized case series have described clinical factors associated with COVID-19, while ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression analyses have been described in some cell types. Cancer patients may have worse outcomes to COVID-19. Methods: We performed an integrated study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across and within organ systems, by normal versus tumor, across several existing databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, Census of Immune Single Cell Expression Atlas, The Human Cell Landscape, and more). We correlated gene expression with clinical factors (including but not limited to age, gender, race, BMI and smoking history), HLA genotype, immune gene expression patterns, cell subsets, and single-cell sequencing as well as commensal microbiome. Results: Matched normal tissues generally display higher ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared with cancer, with normal and tumor from digestive organs expressing the highest levels. No clinical factors were consistently identified to be significantly associated with gene expression levels though outlier organ systems were observed for some factors. Similarly, no HLA genotypes were consistently associated with gene expression levels. Strong correlations were observed between ACE2 expression levels and multiple immune gene signatures including interferon-stimulated genes and the T cell-inflamed phenotype as well as inverse associations with angiogenesis and transforming growth factor-{beta} signatures. ACE2 positively correlated with macrophage subsets across tumor types. TMPRSS2 was less associated with immune gene expression but was strongly associated with epithelial cell abundance. Single-cell sequencing analysis across nine independent studies demonstrated little to no ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in lymphocytes or macrophages. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression associated with commensal microbiota in matched normal tissues particularly from colorectal cancers, with distinct bacterial populations showing strong associations. Conclusions: We performed a large-scale integration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across clinical, genetic, and microbiome domains. We identify novel associations with the microbiota and confirm host immunity associations with gene expression. We suggest caution in interpretation regarding genetic associations with ACE2 expression suggested from smaller case series.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Riyue Bao","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Hillman Cancer Center; University of Pittsburgh Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kyle Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jason J Luke","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Hillman Cancer Center; University of Pittsburgh Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Li","author_inst":"Hubei Academy of Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chuan Yi","author_inst":"Hubei Academy of Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ting Zhang","author_inst":"Hubei Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yongzhong Jiang","author_inst":"Hubei Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuning He","author_inst":"Research Institute for Environmental Innovation (Tsinghua-Suzhou)"},{"author_name":"Songqiang Deng","author_inst":"Research Institute for Environmental Innovation (Tsinghua-Suzhou)"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Guanghe Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jiuhui Qu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Claudio Bandi","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Matteo Brilli","author_inst":"University of Milano"},{"author_name":"Abdul Karim Sesay","author_inst":"Genomics Core Facility, Lab service, MRCG at LSHTM, Fajara, The Gambia"},{"author_name":"Yinqiu Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Daoju Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shuaiyao Lu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Hongqi Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaozhong Peng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20084038","rel_title":"Validation of N95 filtering facepiece respirator decontamination methods available at a large university hospital","rel_date":"2020-04-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20084038","rel_abs":"Importance: Filtering facepiece respirators, including N95 masks, are a critical component of infection prevention in hospitals. Due to unprecedented shortages in N95 respirators, many healthcare systems have explored reprocessing of N95 respirators. Data supporting these approaches are lacking in real hospital settings. In particular, published studies have not yet reported an evaluation of multiple viruses, bacteria, and fungi along with respirator filtration and fit in a single, full-scale study. Objective: We initiated a full-scale study to evaluate different N95 FFR decontamination strategies and their impact on respirator integrity and inactivating multiple microorganisms, with experimental conditions informed by the needs and constraints of the hospital. Methods: We explored several reprocessing methods using new 3MTM 1860 N95 respirators, including dry (<10% relative humidity) and moist (62-66% relative humidity) heat (80-82 oC) in the drying cycle of industrial instrument washers, ethylene oxide (EtO), pulsed xenon UV (UV-PX), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), and vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Respirator samples were treated and analyzed for biological indicator inactivation using four viruses (MS2, phi6, influenza A virus, murine hepatitis virus), three bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus), and the fungus Aspergillus niger. The impact of different application media was also evaluated. In parallel, decontaminated respirators were evaluated for filtration integrity and fit. Results: VHP resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all tested biological indicators. The combination of UV-PX + moist heat resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all biological indicators except G. stearothermohphilus. Greater than 95% filtration efficiency was maintained following 2 (UV-PX + <10% relative humidity heat) or 10 (VHP) cycles of treatment, and proper fit was also preserved. UV-PX + dry heat was insufficient to inactivate all biological indicators. Although very effective at virus decontamination, HPGP resulted in decreased filtration efficiency after 3 cycles, and EtO treatment raised potential toxicity concerns. The observed inactivation of viruses with UV-PX, heat, and hydrogen peroxide treatments varied as a function of which culture media (PBS buffer or DMEM) they were deposited in. Conclusions and Relevance: High levels of biological indicator inactivation were achieved following treatment with either moist heat or VHP. These same treatments did not significantly impact mask filtration or fit. Hospitals have a variety of scalable options to safely reprocess N95 masks. Beyond value in the current Covid-19 pandemic, the broad group of microorganisms and conditions tested make these results relevant in potential future pandemic scenarios.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krista R.

Identification of regions with high risk for COVID 19 outbreak is a major priority of the governmental organizations and epidemiologists worldwide. The aims of the present study were to analyze the risk factors of coronavirus outbreak and identify areas with a high risk of human infection with virus in Fars Province, Iran. A geographic information system (GIS) based machine learning algorithm (MLA), support vector machine (SVM), was used for the assessment of the outbreak risk of COVID 19 in Fars Province, Iran. The daily observations of infected cases was tested in the third-degree polynomial and the autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models to examine the patterns of virus infestation in the province and in Iran. The results of disease outbreak in Iran were compared with the data for Iran and the world. Sixteen effective factors including minimum temperature of coldest month (MTCM), maximum temperature of warmest month (MTWM), precipitation in wettest month (PWM), precipitation of driest month (PDM), distance from roads, distance from mosques, distance from hospitals, distance from fuel stations, human footprint, density of cities, distance from bus stations, distance from banks, distance from bakeries, distance from attraction sites, distance from automated teller machines (ATMs), and density of villages were selected for spatial modelling. The predictive ability of an SVM model was assessed using the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) validation technique. The validation outcome reveals that SVM achieved an AUC value of 0.786 (March 20), 0.799 (March 29), and 86.6 (April 10) a good prediction of change detection. The growth rate (GR) average for active cases in Fars for a period of 41 days was 1.26, whilst it was 1.13 in country and the world. The results of the third-degree polynomial and ARMA models revealed an increasing trend for GR with an evidence of turning, demonstrating extensive quarantines has been effective. The general trends of virus infestation in Iran and Fars Province were similar, although an explosive growth of the infected cases is expected in the country. The results of this study might assist better programming COVID 19 disease prevention and control and gaining sorts of predictive capability would have wide ranging benefits.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamid Reza Pourghasemi","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"Soheila Pouyan","author_inst":"Yazd University"},{"author_name":"Zakariya Farajzadeh","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"Nitheshnirmal Sadhasivam","author_inst":"Bharathidasan University"},{"author_name":"Bahram Heidari","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"Sedigheh Babaei","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"John P Tiefenbacher","author_inst":"Texas State University"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

In this work, we perform Bayesian parameter inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models with time-varying spreading rates for South Africa. The results find two change points in the spreading rate of COVID-19 in South Africa as inferred from the confirmed cases. The first change point coincides with state enactment of a travel ban and the resultant containment of imported infections. The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data. The results further suggest that due to the likely effect of the national lockdown, community level transmissions are slower than the original imported case driven spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rendani Mbuvha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Tshilidzi Marwala","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Zakariya Farajzadeh","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"Nitheshnirmal Sadhasivam","author_inst":"Bharathidasan University"},{"author_name":"Bahram Heidari","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"Sedigheh Babaei","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"John P Tiefenbacher","author_inst":"Texas State University"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We content, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents i) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and ii) by fitting the model to a COVID-19 data set provided by John Hopkins University (JHUCSSE) for the period Jan-31-20 to Mar-24-20, for the countries of Italy, Germany, Iran, and France.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirhossein Taghvaei","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Tryphon T.

Every successful strategy in controlling SARS-CoV2 infection depends on the timely viral diagnosis which should include asymptomatic carriers. Consequently, strategies to increase the throughput for clinical laboratories to conduct large-scale diagnostic testing are urgently needed. Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects. We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of costs and time. Simulation data are used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations when epidemiological and clinical data are used to create an \"informed\" version of the pooling. Different scenarios are examined in the simulations to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for the virus frequency. Our results allow to customize the pooling strategy according to the specific characteristics of the cohort to be tested.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renato Millioni","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Mortarino","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Mantero","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Allen R Tannenbaum","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Bahram Heidari","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"Sedigheh Babaei","author_inst":"Shiraz University"},{"author_name":"John P Tiefenbacher","author_inst":"Texas State University"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

Few African countries have reported case numbers above one thousand, with South Africa reporting 3,034 cases being hit hardest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times of about 2.5 days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth reported for Hubei\/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (with 1.14 million inhabitants) hints that keeping current levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in South Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent and the Global South.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malte Schr\u00f6der","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bossert","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kersting","author_inst":"Georg August University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Aeffner","author_inst":"University Medical Center G&oumlttingen"},{"author_name":"Justin Coetzee","author_inst":"GoMetro, Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marc Timme","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control - among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both, in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. We allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a \"trace & isolate\" approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a \"trace & isolate\" approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific take-up rates for tracing apps.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veronika Grimm","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Friederike Mengel","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Martin Schmidt","author_inst":"Trier University"},{"author_name":"Chatcharawan Meesubthong","author_inst":"Faculty of Business Administration, Huachiew Chalermprakiet University, Samutprakan province, 10540, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Justin Coetzee","author_inst":"GoMetro, Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marc Timme","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

Regression tree, cluster analysis and principal component analysis are implemented to global COVID-19 data of 133 countries obtained from the Worldometer website as reported as on April 17, 2020. Our results suggest that there are four major clusters among the countries. First cluster consists of 8 countries where cumulative infected cases and deaths are highest. It is also revealed that there are two principal components. The countries which play vital role to explain the 60\\% variation of the total variations by the first component characterized by all variables except the rate variables include USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, and Iran. Remaining countries contribute to explaining 20\\% variation of the total variations by the second component characterized by only three rate variables. We also found that the number of tests by the country variable among other variables country, number of active cases, number of deaths, number of recovered patients, number of serious cases, and number of new cases is an unimportant variable to predict cumulative number of confirmed cases. Hence, the number of tests might play vital role to individual country level who are in the primary level of virus spread but not to the global level.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Hossain","author_inst":"North South University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Martin Schmidt","author_inst":"Trier University"},{"author_name":"Chatcharawan Meesubthong","author_inst":"Faculty of Business Administration, Huachiew Chalermprakiet University, Samutprakan province, 10540, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Justin Coetzee","author_inst":"GoMetro, Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marc Timme","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

We propose a method to enhance processing large amounts of collected samples. The method is based on mixing samples in testing tubes in a specific configuration, as opposed to testing single samples in each tube, and ac- counting for natural virus amounts in infected patients from variation of positiveness in test tubes. To illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method we carry out numerical tests for actual scenarios under various tests. Applying the proposed method enhances the number of tests by order of magnitudes, where all positives are identified with no false negatives, and the effective testing time can be reduced drastically even when the uncertainty in the test is relatively high.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Usama Kadri","author_inst":"cardiff university"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Hossain","author_inst":"North South University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Martin Schmidt","author_inst":"Trier University"},{"author_name":"Chatcharawan Meesubthong","author_inst":"Faculty of Business Administration, Huachiew Chalermprakiet University, Samutprakan province, 10540, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Justin Coetzee","author_inst":"GoMetro, Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marc Timme","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Adam S.

Design: Retrospective observational cohort with internal and multi-hospital external validation. Setting: Secondary care. Interventions: Not applicable. Participants: Training and temporal external validation cohorts comprised 1464 patients admitted to King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (KCH) with COVID-19 disease from 1st March to 30th April 2020. External validation cohorts included 3869 patients from two UK NHS Trusts (Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals, GSTT and University Hospitals Southampton, UHS) and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was patient status at 14 days after symptom onset categorised as severe disease (transferred to intensive care unit or death). Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) were included. Results: NEWS2 score on admission was a weak predictor of severe COVID-19 infection (AUC = 0.628). Adding age and common blood tests (CRP, neutrophil count, estimated GFR and albumin) provided substantial improvements to a risk stratification model, particularly in relation to sensitivity, but performance was only moderate (AUC = 0.753). Improvement over NEWS2 remained robust and generalisable in GSTT (AUC = 0.817), UHS (AUC = 0.835) and Wuhan hospitals (AUC = 0.918). Conclusions: Adding age and a minimal set of blood parameters to NEWS2 improves the detection of patients likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes. This finding was replicated across NHS and non-UK hospitals. Adding a few common parameters to a pre-existing acuity score allows rapid and easy implementation of this risk-scoring system.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ewan Carr","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Stammers","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Wenjuan Wang","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Huayu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Thomas Searle","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Zeljko Kraljevic","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony Shek","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20077933","rel_title":"Comprehensive Investigation and Isolation have Effectively Suppressed the Spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20077933","rel_abs":"The outbreak of COVID-19 since Dec. 2019 has caused severe life and economic damage worldwide, many countries are trapped by medical resource constraints or absence of targeted therapeutics, and therefore the implement of systemic policies to block this pandemic should be prioritized.

Methods: We retrospectively collected 147 clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital of Hubei, China. We analyzed the coagulation function in COVID-19 patients through the data including thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), 2-plasmininhibitor-plasmin Complex (PIC), thrombomodulin (TM), t-PA\/PAI-1 Complex (t-PAIC), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (TT), D-Dimer (DD), and platelet (PLT). Result: The levels of TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, FIB, and DD in COVID-19 patients were higher than health controls (p<0.05), and also higher in the patients with thrombotic disease than without thrombotic disease (p<0.05). What's more, the patients with thrombotic disease had a higher case-fatality (p<0.05). TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, FIB, DD, and PLT were also found correlated with disease severity. Meanwhile, we found that there were significant difference in TAT, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, DD, and PLT in the death and survival group. Further using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis also found that t-PAIC and DD were independent risk factors for death in patients and are excellent predicting the mortality risk of COVID-19. Conclusion: The coagulation systems in COVID-19 patients are inordinate, and dynamic monitoring of them, might be a key in the control of COVID-19 death.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Duan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tengfei Bao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Junjuan Gu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yawen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078105","rel_title":"A Nationwide Survey of UK cardiac surgeons view on clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078105","rel_abs":"Background: No firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK senior surgeons opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab, PCR and chest CT; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patients COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of CABG surgery during the pandemic was more controversial. Conclusions: In the current unprecedented scenario, the present survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Umberto Benedetto","author_inst":"Bristol Heart Institute, University Hospitals bristol NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew Goodwin","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Kendall","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Uppal","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Turst"},{"author_name":"Enoch Akowuah","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075093","rel_title":"COVID-19 containment policies through time may cost more lives at metapopulation level","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075093","rel_abs":"The rapid and pandemic spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented containment policies in response to overloaded health care systems.

positive test frequency data is essential for achievement of better knowledge of the natural history of the virus in human populations, improved accuracy of CoV-19 epidemiological data, and development of public response policies that are better crafted to address the current CoV-19-induced global crisis. A statistical analysis of currently available positive test frequency data reveals a surprisingly uniform relationship between the number of CoV-19 test performed and the number of positive tests obtained. The uniformity is particularly striking for United States CoV-19 test data. Such observations warrant closer evaluation of other factors, besides virus spread, that may also contribute to the nature of the coronavirus pandemic. These include indigenous CoV-19 and the quality of CoV-19 testing.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James L Sherley","author_inst":"Asymmetrex LLC"},{"author_name":"Joseph T Wu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kuang Xu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lawrence M Wein","author_inst":"Stanford Unversity"},{"author_name":"Enoch Akowuah","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078279","rel_title":"COVID-19 data analysis and modeling in Palestine","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078279","rel_abs":"We estimate an actual number of infected cases in Palestine based on the 18-day effect from infection to death.

Although Vietnam has successfully controlled the COVID-19 pandemic to date, there is a sign of initial community transmission. An estimate of possible scenarios to prepare health resources in the future is needed. We used modelling methods to estimate impacts of mitigation measures on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Methods: SEIR model built in the COVIDSIM1.1 tool was adopted using available data for estimation. The herd immunization scenario was with no intervention implemented. Other scenarios consisted of isolation and social distancing at different levels (25%, 50%, 75% and 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively). Outcomes include epidemic apex, daily new and cumulative cases, deaths, hospitalized patients and ICU beds needed. Results: By April 8, 2020, there would be 465 infected cases with COVID-19 in Viet Nam, of those 50% were detected. Cumulatively, there would be 1,400 cases and 30 deaths by end of 2020, if 75% of cases was detected and isolated, and 30% of social distancing could be maintained. The most effective intervention scenario is the detection and isolation of 75% infected cases and reduction of 10% social contacts. This will require an expansion of testing capacity at health facilities and in the community, posing a challenge to identify high-risk groups to prioritized testing. Conclusions: In a localized epidemic setting, the expansion of testing should be the key measure to control the epidemic. Social distancing plays a significant role to prevent further transmission to the community.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thu Anh Nguyen","author_inst":"Sydney School of Medicine, The Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Quoc Cuong Nguyen","author_inst":"Save the Children International, Vientiane, Laos"},{"author_name":"Anh Thi Kim Le","author_inst":"Hanoi University of Public Health, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Huyen Nguyen Nguyen","author_inst":"National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thao Thi Huong Nguyen","author_inst":"Strategic Consultancy Company, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078303","rel_title":"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078303","rel_abs":"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 umol\/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration >150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality. Pharmacokinetic modelling combined with these lethality data predicts that the majority of chloroquine regimens trialled in COVID-19 should not cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James A Watson","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Joel Tarning","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Richard M Hoglund","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Frederic J Baud","author_inst":"Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Bruno Megarbane","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Clemessy","author_inst":"Clinique du Sport"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J White","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.065383","rel_title":"In silico analysis of RT-qPCR designs recommended by WHO for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and a commercial kit validated following UNE\/EN ISO 17025:2005 and two reference laboratories","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.065383","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a serious infectious disease affecting human health worldwide and rapidly declared a pandemic by WHO. Early, several RT-qPCR were designed by using only the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.\n\nObjectivesA few days later, when additional SARS-CoV-2 genome were retrieved, the kit GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was designed to provide a highly specific detection method and commercially available worldwide. The kit was validated following criteria recommended by the UNE\/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO\/IEC 15189:2012.\n\nMethodsThe present study approached the in silico specificity of the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test and RT-qPCR designs currently published. The empirical validation parameters specificity (inclusivity\/exclusivity), quantitative phase analysis (10-106 copies), reliability (repeatability\/reproducibility) and sensitivity (detection\/quantification limits) were evaluated for a minimum of 10-15 assays. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), (Madrid, Spain) and the Public Health England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK).\n\nResultsThe GPS RT-qPCR primers and probe showed the highest number of mismatches with the closet related non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including some indels. The kits passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by suing reference methods and received an evaluation with 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.\n\nConclusionsThe GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available with full analytical and diagnostic validation, represents a case of efficient transfer of technology being successfully used since the pandemic was declared. The analysis suggested the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test is the more exclusive by far.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio J Martinez-Murcia","author_inst":"Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"author_name":"Gema Bru","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Aaron Navarro","author_inst":"Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"author_name":"Patricia Ros-T\u00e1rraga","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda-Sirera","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Laura P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"genetic PCR solutions"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J White","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genetics"}]}
