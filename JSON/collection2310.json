These consequences include changes in health impacting behaviours (such as exercise, sleep, diet and alcohol use) which are important drivers of health inequalities. We sought to add to the rapidly developing empirical evidence base investigating the impacts of the pandemic on such behavioural outcomes. Methods: Using data from five nationally representative British cohort studies (born 2000-2, 1989-90, 1970, 1958, and 1946), we investigated sleep, physical activity (exercise), diet, and alcohol intake (N=14,297). Using measures of each behaviour reported before and during lockdown, we investigated change in each behaviour, and whether such changes differed by age\/cohort, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic position (SEP; childhood social class, education attainment, and adult reporting of financial difficulties). Binary logistic regression models were used, accounting for study design and incorporating non-response weights, to estimate absolute differences in each outcome before and during lockdown within each cohort. Meta-analysis was used to pool cohort-specific estimates and formally test for heterogeneity across cohorts. Results: Changes in these outcomes occurred in both directions, i.e. shifts from the middle part of the distribution to both declines and increases in sleep, exercise, and alcohol use. For all outcomes, older cohorts were less likely to report changes in behaviours compared with younger cohorts. In the youngest cohort (born 2001), the following shifts were more evident: increases in exercise, fruit and vegetable intake, sleep duration, and less frequent alcohol consumption. Widening inequalities in sleep during lockdown were more frequent amongst females, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and ethnic minorities. For other outcomes, inequalities were largely similar before and during lockdown, yet ethnic minorities were increasingly likely during lockdown to undertake less exercise and consume lower amounts of fruit and vegetables. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the multiple changes to behavioural outcomes that may have occurred due to COVID-19 lockdown, and the differential impacts across generation, gender, socioeconomic circumstances across life, and ethnicity. Such changes require further monitoring given their possible implications to population health and the widening of health inequalities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Bann","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Aase Villadsen","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jane Maddock","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Alun Hughes","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"George Ploubidis","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Silverwood","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Praveetha Patalay","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20163915","rel_title":"Converting Microwave Ovens into Plasma-Generating Decontamination Units for N-95 Respirators","rel_date":"2020-07-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20163915","rel_abs":"We show how a common microwave oven, a coat-hanger and a coffee cup can be used to decontaminate N-95 respirators in 30 seconds.

Spatial dependence among the data was controlled using the latitude and longitude of the centroid of the countries\/territories. Stratified analyses were conducted by economic level and COVID-19 testing policy. The average of country\/territory-specific COVID-19 CFR is about 2-3% worldwide, which is higher than previously reported at 0.7-1.3%. Statistically significant associations were observed between COVID-19 CFR and population size and proportion of female smokers. The open testing policies are associated with decreased CFR. Strictness of anti-COVID-19 measures was not statistically significantly associated with CFR overall, but the higher stringency index was associated with higher CFR in higher income countries with active testing policies. The statistically significant association between population size and COVID-19 CRF suggests the healthcare strain and lower treatment efficiency in countries with large populations. The observed association between smoking in females and COVID-19 CFR might be due to that the proportion of female smokers reflected broadly income level of a country. When testing is warranted and healthcare resources are sufficient, strict quarantine and\/or lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in underprivileged populations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Cao","author_inst":"Orebro University"},{"author_name":"Ayako Hiyoshi","author_inst":"Orebro University"},{"author_name":"Scott Montgomery","author_inst":"Orebro University"},{"author_name":"Vishal Verma","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Thanh H.

Design: Sequential follow-up study. Setting: Largest tertiary care centre in northern Germany. Participants: 1253 employees of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were sequentially assessed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at the beginning of the covid-19 epidemic (20 March - 9 April), one month (20 April - 8 May), and another two months later (22 June - 24 July). Of those, 1026 were healthcare workers (HCWs) of whom 292 were directly involved in the care of covid-19 patients. During the study period, infection control interventions were deployed, those included i) strict barrier nursing of all known covid-19 patients including FFP2 (N95) masks, goggles, gloves, hoods and protective gowns, ii) visitor restrictions with access control at all hospital entries, iii) mandatory wearing of disposable face masks in all clinical settings, and iv) universal RT-PCR admission screening of patients. Main Outcome Measures: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion rate. Results: At the initial screening, ten participants displayed significant IgG antibody ratios. Another ten individuals showed seroconversion at the second time point one month later, only two further participants seroconverted during the subsequent two months. The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the study cohort at the last follow-up was 1.8%, the seroconversion rate dropped from 0.81% to 0.08% per month despite a longer observation period. Amongst HCWs seropositivity was increased in those directly involved in the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.8%, n=11) compared to other HCWs (1.4%, n=10, P=0.025). However, after the adoption of all multimodal infection control interventions seroconversions were observed in only two more HCWs, neither of whom were involved in inpatient care. Conclusion: Multimodal infection control and prevention interventions are highly effective in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infections of healthcare professionals.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Theo Brehm","author_inst":"I.

Although no exception, Tokyo, Japan was affected at first by only a small epidemic. Medical collapse nevertheless nearly happened because no predictive method existed for counting patients. A standard SIR epidemiological model and its derivatives predict susceptible, infectious, and removed (recovered\/deaths) cases but ignore isolation of confirmed cases. Predicting COVID19 trends with hospitalized and infectious people in field separately is important to prepare beds and develop quarantine strategies. Methods: Time-series COVID19 data from February 28 to May 23, 2020 in Tokyo were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on delay differential equation was proposed. The model can evaluate patients in hospitals and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new cases, cumulative infections, patients in hospital, and PCR test positivity ratios were used to examine the model. This approach derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model. Its results were compared quantitatively with those of the present isolation model. Results: The basic reproductive number, inferred as 2.30, is a dimensionless parameter composed of modeling parameters. Effects of intervention to mitigate the epidemic spread were assessed a posteriori. An exit policy of how and when to release a statement of emergency was also assessed using the model. Furthermore, results suggest that the rapid isolation of infectious cases has a large potential to effectively mitigate the spread of infection and restores social and economic activities safely. Conclusions: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using COVID19 data for Tokyo. Results show that shortening the period from infection to hospitalization is effective against outbreak without rigorous public health intervention and control. Faster and precise case cluster detection and wider and quicker introduction of testing measures are strongly recommended.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Motoaki Utamura","author_inst":"Utamura professional engineer office"},{"author_name":"Makoto Koizumi","author_inst":"not applicable"},{"author_name":"Seiichi Kirikami","author_inst":"not applicable"},{"author_name":"Veronika Schlicker","author_inst":"I.

Prior research has highlighted the relation between perceptions of risk in employment and its concomitant financial risk with a myriad of consequences for people's well-being and health. In order to analyze the potential negative consequences of temporary layoffs, downsizing or closure of companies and businesses, and the consequent insecurity about the continuity of employment, the aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, to analyze the relations between the perceptions of job insecurity and financial threat and overall mental health during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of the Chilean adult population. And secondly, to identify the potential buffer effect of perceived social support on this relation. To analyze this, we carried out a cross-sectional study on a non-probabilistic sample aimed at a general Chilean adult population. The results show that both perceptions of job insecurity and financial threat are associated with a decline in perceived mental health. Additionally, results indicate a moderate buffer effect of perceived social support relative to the size of the social network. Thus, in relation to job insecurity and financial threat, the network size mitigates the association of both with the decline in perceived mental health. The theoretical and applied scope of these findings are analyzed, and their challenges and limitations are discussed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos-Maria Alcover","author_inst":"Universidad Rey Juan Carlos"},{"author_name":"Sergio Salgado","author_inst":"Universidad de La Frontera"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Nazar","author_inst":"Universidad de Concepcion"},{"author_name":"Raul Ramirez-Vielma","author_inst":"Universidad de Concepcion"},{"author_name":"Carolina Gonzalez-Suhr","author_inst":"Universidad de La Frontera"},{"author_name":"Michelle Thompson","author_inst":"I.

However, it is unknown if COVID-19 results in persistent fatigue in those recovered from acute infection. We examined the prevalence of fatigue in individuals recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 illness using the Chalder Fatigue Score (CFQ-11). We further examined potential predictors of fatigue following COVID-19 infection, evaluating indicators of COVID-19 severity, markers of peripheral immune activation and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of 128 participants (49.5 {+\/-} 15 years; 54% female), more than half reported persistent fatigue (52.3%; 45\/128) at 10 weeks (median) after initial COVID-19 symptoms. There was no association between COVID-19 severity (need for inpatient admission, supplemental oxygen or critical care) and fatigue following COVID-19. Additionally, there was no association between routine laboratory markers of inflammation and cell turnover (leukocyte, neutrophil or lymphocyte counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein) or pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-6 or sCD25) and fatigue post COVID-19. Female gender and those with a pre-existing diagnosis of depression\/anxiety were over-represented in those with fatigue. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of post-viral fatigue in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after the acute phase of COVID-19 illness.

We aimed to study the impact of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab on the outcome of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19. Methods: Eighty-seven patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and moderate to severe ARDS were included (n tocilizumab = 29, n controls = 58). A matched cohort was created using a propensity score. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality, secondary endpoints included ventilation-free days and length of stay. Results: No difference was found in 30-day all-cause mortality in patients treated with tocilizumab compared to controls (17.2% vs. 32.8%, p = 0.2; HR = 0.52 [0.19 - 1.39], p = 0.19). Ventilator-free days were 19.0 (IQR 12.5 - 20.0) versus 9 (IQR 0.0 - 18.5; p = 0.04), respectively. A higher rate of freedom from mechanical ventilation at 30 days was achieved in patients receiving tocilizumab (HR 2.83 [1.48 - 5.40], p < 0.002). Median length of stay in ICU and total length of stay were reduced by 8 and 9.5 days in patients treated with tocilizumab.

Conclusions: Treatment of critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 with tocilizumab was not associated with reduced 30-day all-cause mortality, but shorter duration on ventilatory support as well as shorter overall length of stay in hospital and in ICU.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johannes Eimer","author_inst":"Karolinska Univeristy Hopsital Huddinge, Sweden, Unit of Infectious Diseases."},{"author_name":"Jan Vesterbacka","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital HUddinge, Sweden, Unit of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Anna-Karin Svensson","author_inst":"Karolinska Univeristy Hospital Huddinge, Sweden, Unit of Infectious DIseases"},{"author_name":"Bertil Stojanovic","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital HUddinge, Sweden, Unit of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Charlotta Wagrell","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden, Unit of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Anders Sonnerborg","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital HUddinge, Sweden, Unit of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Piotr Nowak","author_inst":"Karolinska INstitute, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Sweden, Unit of Infectious DIseases"},{"author_name":"Aoife Mooney","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deirdre Leavy","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katie Ridge","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Catherine King","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fionnuala Cox","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kate O'Brien","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanne Dowds","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jamie Sugrue","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"David Hopkins","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Patricia Byrne","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tara Kingston","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cliona Ni Cheallaigh","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Parthiban Nadarajan","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Marie McLaughlin","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nollaig M Bourke","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Colm Bergin","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cliona O'Farrelly","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Bannan","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Niall Conlon","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20164277","rel_title":"Corticosteroid Use in Severely Hypoxemic COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Cohort Analysis of Dosing Patterns and Outcomes in the Early Phase of the Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20164277","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION Hypoxemia in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to Novel Coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is mediated by severe inflammation that may be mitigated by corticosteroids. We evaluated pattern and effects of corticosteroid use in these patients during an early surge of the pandemic. METHODS Observational study of 136 SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to the Intensive care Unit between March 1 and April 27, 2020 at a tertiary care hospital in Indianapolis, USA. Statistical comparison between cohorts and dosing pattern analysis was done. Outcome measures included number of patients requiring intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay and inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Of 136 patients, 72 (53%) received corticosteroids. Groups demographics: Age (60.5 vs. 65; p .083), sex (47% male vs. 39% female; p .338) and comorbidities were similar. Corticosteroid group had increased severity of illness: PaO2\/FiO2 (113 vs. 130; p .014) and SOFA (8 vs. 5.5; p < .001). Overall mortality (21% vs. 30%; p .234) or proportion of patients intubated (78 vs. 64%; p .078) was similar. Mortality was similar among mechanically ventilated (27% vs. 15%; p .151) however there were no deaths among patients who were not mechanically ventilated and received corticosteroids (0% vs. 57%; p <.001). Early administration (within 48 hours) showed decrease in proportion of intubation (66% vs. 87 vs. 100%; p.045), ICU days (6 vs., 16 vs. 18; p <.001), and ventilator days (3 vs. 12 & 14; p <.001). 45% received methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids were used more frequently in SARS CoV-2 patients with higher severity of illness. Early administration of corticosteroids improved survival in non-mechanically ventilated patients; decreased ICU stay and may have prevented intubation.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Rahman","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Russel A Trigonis","author_inst":"IndianaUniversity School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mitchell K Craft","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel M Kruer","author_inst":"Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Emily M Miller","author_inst":"Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Colin L Terry","author_inst":"Indiana University Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah A Persaud","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rajat Kapoor","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Deirdre Leavy","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katie Ridge","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Catherine King","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fionnuala Cox","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kate O'Brien","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanne Dowds","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jamie Sugrue","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"David Hopkins","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Patricia Byrne","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tara Kingston","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cliona Ni Cheallaigh","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Parthiban Nadarajan","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Marie McLaughlin","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nollaig M Bourke","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Colm Bergin","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cliona O'Farrelly","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Bannan","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Niall Conlon","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20163964","rel_title":"Brazilian dental students and COVID-19: a survey on knowledge and perceptions","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20163964","rel_abs":"This study evaluated the knowledge and perception of Brazilian dental students about COVID-19 and the undergraduate clinical practice during the outbreak by a self-administered web-based questionnaire.

Descriptive statistics were used to identify frequencies and distributions of variables, which were compared by type of institution and current year of enrollment using Chi-square or Fishers exact tests (alpha=0.05). A total of 833 valid responses were received over 10 days. Students were able to identify the incubation period, main symptoms, and contagious routes of the disease but struggled in recognizing the name of the virus responsible for the pandemics. Hand washing before and after a dental appointment with a patient (97.7%) followed by use of barriers to protect mucosa (97.2%) were the more frequently recognized measures to prevent COVID-19 spread in the dental office. As for the perception of COVID-19, 73.2% of the dental students perceive the disease as severe, while only 11.1% of them think that COVID-19 is severe only for people presenting risk factors. Dental students knowledge and perception were associated with the type of institution and year of enrollment. In summary, the dental students demonstrated an acceptable general knowledge about COVID-19, but dental schools will need to address gaps in knowledge and control measures and perceptions to ensure a safer return to practical activities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Gerusa Brito Aragao","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Francisco Isaac Fernandes Gomes","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Leticia Pinho Maia Paixao de Melo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Silmara Aparecida Milori Corona","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Emily M Miller","author_inst":"Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Colin L Terry","author_inst":"Indiana University Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah A Persaud","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rajat Kapoor","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Deirdre Leavy","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katie Ridge","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Catherine King","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fionnuala Cox","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kate O'Brien","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanne Dowds","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jamie Sugrue","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"David Hopkins","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Patricia Byrne","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tara Kingston","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cliona Ni Cheallaigh","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Parthiban Nadarajan","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne Marie McLaughlin","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nollaig M Bourke","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Colm Bergin","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cliona O'Farrelly","author_inst":"Trinity College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Bannan","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Niall Conlon","author_inst":"St James's Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"dentistry and oral medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20164269","rel_title":"The potential health and economic impact of dexamethasone treatment for patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20164269","rel_abs":"Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients needing oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively.

Assuming that dexamethasone has a similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, this would translate into approximately 650,000 [240,000 - 1,400,000] lives saved globally. If dexamethasone acts differently in these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value.

Publicly available state-level data was collected which included: demographics comorbidities, state characteristics and environmental factors. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify the significantly associated factors with percent mortality, case and testing frequency. All analyses were state-level analyses and not patient-level analyses. Results: A total of 1,090,500 COVID-19 cases were reported during the study period. The calculated case and testing frequency were 3,332 and 19,193 per 1,000,000 patients. There were 63,642 deaths during this period which resulted in a mortality of 5.8%. Factors including to but not limited to population density (beta coefficient 7.5, p< 0.01), transportation volume (beta coefficient 0.1, p< 0.01), tourism index (beta coefficient -0.1, p=0.02) and older age (beta coefficient 0.2, p=0.01) are associated with case frequency and percent mortality. Conclusions: There were wide variations in testing and case frequencies of COVID-19 among different states in the US. States with higher population density had a higher case and testing rate.

When demand for essential resources surpasses availability, difficult triaging decisions are necessary. While algorithms exist, almost nothing is known on societal attitudes regarding triage criteria. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted via social media channels to query a broad sample of society. Participants were asked to make triage decisions in case-based vignettes, exploring a variety of factors. They also were asked to assess how sure they were about their decisions, and how such decisions should be reached. Results: The survey was completed in full by 1626 participants in April 2020. Median age was 39 years (range 12-80 years), 984 (61%) were female. Patient prognosis, responsibility towards others, the absence of behavior-induced co-morbidities, and younger age were rated the most important triage criteria, while participants found that insurance status, social status, and nationality should not play a substantial role. Ethics-committees and point systems were regarded potentially helpful for triage decision-making, while decisions based on order of presentation (first-come first-serve) or on a legal basis were viewed critically. Participants were least sure about their decision when dealing with age or behavior-induced co-morbidities. Overall, women were surer about their decisions than men, participants of Christian faith were also more secure about their decision than atheists-agnostics. Conclusions: This study uses social media to generate insight into public opinion and attitudes regarding triage criteria and modalities. These findings may be helpful for the development of future medical triage algorithms.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oliver J.

In response, the Federal Government expanded unemployment insurance benefits in both size ($600 supplement) and scope (to include caregivers and self-employed workers). We assessed the role of unemployment insurance in mitigating the impact of job loss on food insecurity during COVID-19 in low-income households. We analyzed data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America (UAC) cohort, a longitudinal survey collected by the University of Southern California Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) every two weeks between April 1 and July 8, 2020. We limited the sample to individuals living in households earning less than $75,000 in February 2020 who lost their jobs during COVID-19. Using difference-in-differences and event study regression models, we evaluated the association between receipt of unemployment insurance and self-reported food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints. We found that 40.5% of those living in households earning less than $75,000 and employed in February 2020 experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those who lost their jobs, 31% reported food insecurity and 33% reported eating less due to financial constraints. Food insecurity peaked in April 2020 and declined over time, but began to increase again among people receiving unemployment insurance during the final wave of the survey ahead of the federal supplement to unemployment insurance ending. Food insecurity and eating less were more common among people who were non-White, lived in lower-income households, younger, and who were sexual or gender minorities. Receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.4 percentage point (95% CI: -7.8 to -0.9 percentage points) decline in food insecurity (a 30.3% relative decline compared to the average level of food insecurity during the study period). Receipt of unemployment insurance was also associated with a 6.1 percentage point (95% CI: -9.6 to -2.7 percentage point) decline in eating less due to financial constraints (a 42% relative decline). Estimates from event study specifications revealed that reductions in food insecurity and eating less were greatest in the four-week period immediately following receipt of unemployment insurance, with no evidence of differential pre-existing trends in either outcome. We conclude that UI benefits during the period when the $600\/week federal supplement was in place was associated with large reductions in food insecurity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Raifman","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jacob Bor","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Atheendar Venkataramani","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Lucia Barcellini","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Daniela Colzani","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Marta Canuti","author_inst":"Memorial University of Newfoundland"},{"author_name":"Vania Giacomet","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Valentina Fabiano","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Laura Folgori","author_inst":"Children Hospital V.

We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach (Test-to-Care Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. Methods: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers\/CHWs and structured surveys among providers\/CHWs. Results: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79\/83) were Latinx and 88% (65\/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80\/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36\/80) were uninsured and 55% (44\/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56\/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54\/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time - this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. Conclusions: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by vulnerable populations.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew D.

Timely prediction of the clinical outcome (death\/survival) of hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients can provide early warnings to clinicians, allowing improved allocation of medical resources. In a recently published paper, an interpretable machine learning model was presented to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients with blood biomarkers, where the model was trained and tested on relatively small data sets.

Using monoplex testing, widespread screening would be prohibitively expensive, and throughput may not meet demand. We propose a non-adaptive combinatorial (NAC) group-testing strategy to increase throughput and facilitate rapid turnaround via a single round of testing. Methods: NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350 and 250 with replicates of 2, 4 and 5, respectively. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1-10%, with each simulation ran for 10,000 iterations. Outcomes included the proportions of re-tests required and the proportion of true negatives identified. NAC matrices were compared to Dorfman Sequential (DS) approaches. A web application (www.samplepooling.com) was designed to decode results. Findings: NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels with an average number of 585 tests saved per assay in the n=700 matrix at a 1% prevalence. As prevalence increased, matrix performance deteriorated with n=250 most tolerant. In simulations of low to medium (0.1%-3%) prevalence levels all NAC matrices were superior, as measured by fewer repeated tests required, to the DS approaches. At very high prevalence levels (10%) the DS matrix was marginally superior, however both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. Interpretation: This testing strategy maximises the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to staff members. Using the methodology described here, laboratories can adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Henry McDermott","author_inst":"Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Duncan Stoddard","author_inst":"DS Analytics and Machine Learning Ltd, 12 Hammersmith Grove, Hammersmith, London, M6 7AP"},{"author_name":"Peter Woolf","author_inst":"Origami Assays, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Ellingford","author_inst":"Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"David Gokhale","author_inst":"Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, M13 9WL, UK"},{"author_name":"Algy Taylor","author_inst":"Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, M13 9WL, UK"},{"author_name":"Leigh AM Demain","author_inst":"Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, M13 9WL, UK"},{"author_name":"William G Newman","author_inst":"Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, M13 9WL, UK"},{"author_name":"Graeme Black","author_inst":"Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, M13 9WL, UK"},{"author_name":"James M.

We investigated two COVID-19 school exposure incidents in the Helsinki area. Methods: We conducted two retrospective cohort studies after schools exposures, with a household transmission extension. We defined a case as an exposed person with either a positive RT-PCR, or positive microneutralisation testing (MNT) as confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG antibodies detection via fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA). We recruited close school contacts and families of school cases, calculated attack rates (AR) on school level and families, and identified transmission chains. Findings: In incident A, the index was a pupil. Participation rate was 74% (89\/121), and no cases were identified. In incident B, the index was a member of school personnel. Participation rate was 81% (51\/63). AR was 16% (8\/51): 6 pupils and 1 member of school personnel were MNT and FMIA positive; 1 pupil had a positive RT-PCR, but negative serology samples. We visited all school cases' families (n=8). The AR among close household contacts was 42% (9\/20 in 3\/8 families) but other plausible sources were always reported. At three months post-exposure, 6\/8 school cases were re-sampled and still MNT positive. Interpretation: When the index was a child, no school transmission was identified, while the occurrence of an adult case led to a 16% AR. Further cases were evidenced in 3 families, but other transmission chains were plausible. It is likely that transmission from children to adults is limited.

In addition to standard practices such as enforcing curfews, social distancing, and closure of non-essential service industries, other non-conventional policies such as the total confinement of highly populated areas has also been implemented. Methods: In this paper, we model the movement of a host population using a mechanistic approach based on random walks, which are either diffusive or super-diffusive. Infections are realised through a contact process, whereby a susceptible host may be infected if in close spatial proximity of the infectious host. Our focus is only on the short-time scale prior to the infectious period, so that no further transmission is assumed. Results: We find that the level of infection depends heavily on the population dynamics, and increases in the case of slow population diffusion, but remains stable for a high or super-diffusive population. Also, we find that the confinement of homogeneous or overcrowded sub-populations has minimal impact in the short term. Conclusions: Our results indicate that on a short time scale, confinement restrictions or complete lock down of whole residential areas may not be effective. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for total confinement in the context of the current situation in Kuwait.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danish A Ahmed","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ali R Ansari","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mudassar Imran","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kamaludin Dingle","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Naveed Ahmed","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael A Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pamela Osterlund","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Niina Ikonen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Anu Haveri","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Merit Melin","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Timo J Lukkarinen","author_inst":"City of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Hanna Nohynek","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Nicole M.

Methods: We obtained sera from 36 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. We evaluated samples collected at around 21 days ({+\/-}14 days) after their initial PCR test using 3 commercially available ELISA assays, two anti-spike (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros, and Euroimmun) and one anti-nucleocapsid (Abbott Architect), and a Yale-developed anti-spike ELISA test. We determined the sensitivity of the tests and compared their results. The Euroimmun and Yale ELISA had an equivocal and indeterminate category, which were considered as both negative and positive. Results: Among the 36 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mean age was 43 ({+\/-}13) years and 19 (53%) were female. The sensitivities of the tests were not significantly different (Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, Euroimmmun, and Yale assays: 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71-95), 94% (95% CI, 81-99), 86% (95% CI, 71-95), and 94% (95% CI, 81-99), respectively; p-value=0.464). The sensitivities of the Euroimmun and Yale ELISA tests increased when the equivocal\/indeterminate results were considered positive (97% [95% CI, 85-100] and 100% [95% CI, 90-100], respectively), but were not significantly different from other tests (p=0.082). The cross-correlation coefficient ranged from 0.85-0.98 between three anti-spike protein assays (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, Yale) and was 0.58-0.71 between the three anti-spike protein assays and the anti-nucleocapsid assay (Abbott). Conclusion: The sensitivities of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein assays did not significantly differ, although the sample size was small. Sensitivity also depended on the interpretation of equivocal and indeterminate results. The strongest correlations were present for the three anti-spike proteins assays. These findings suggest that individual test characteristics and the correlation between different tests should be considered when comparing or aggregating data across different populations studies for serologic surveillance of past SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiwani Mahajan","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carrie A Redlich","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam V Wisnewski","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Louis E Fazen","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lokinendi V Rao","author_inst":"Quest Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Karthik Kuppusamy","author_inst":"Quest Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Harlan M Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anu Haveri","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Merit Melin","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Timo J Lukkarinen","author_inst":"City of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Hanna Nohynek","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Nicole M.

The basic reproduction number, R0, provides a quantitative measure of the transmission potential of a pathogen. Objective: Conduct a scoping review of the available literature providing estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2, provide an overview of the drivers of variation in R0 estimates and the considerations taken in the calculation of the parameter. Design: Scoping review of available literature between the 01 December 2019 and 07 May 2020. Data sources: Both peer-reviewed and pre-print articles were searched for on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Selection criteria: Studies were selected for review if (i) the estimation of R0 represented either the initial stages of the outbreak or the initial stages of the outbreak prior to the onset of widespread population restriction (lockdown), (ii) the exact dates of the study period were provided and (iii) the study provided primary estimates of R0. Results: A total of 20 R0 estimates were extracted from 15 studies. There was substantial variation in the estimates reported. Estimates derived from mathematical models fell within a wider range of 1.94-6.94 than statistical models which fell between the range of 2.2 to 4.4. Several studies made assumptions about the length of the infectious period which ranged from 5.8-20 days and the serial interval which ranged from 4.41-14 days. For a given set of parameters a longer duration of infectiousness or a longer serial interval equates to a higher R0. Several studies took measures to minimise bias in early case reporting, to account for the potential occurrence of super-spreading events, and to account for early sub-exponential epidemic growth. Conclusions: The variation in reported estimates of R0 reflects the complex nature of the parameter itself, including the context (i.e. social\/spatial structure), the methodology used to estimate the parameter, and model assumptions. R0 is a fundamental parameter in the study of infectious disease dynamics however it provides limited practical applicability outside of the context in which it was estimated, and should be calculated and interpreted with this in mind.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Aine Collins","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Quirine Ten Bosch","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"Mart De Jong","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"David Mc Evoy","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

Understanding the communicability period of SARS-CoV-2 is important to inform the period of isolation required to prevent nosocomial and community spread. The objective of this study was to identify the reported communicable period of SARS-CoV-2, based on a rapid review of existing literature. Methods: Studies reporting empirical data on the period of communicability of SARS-CoV-2 through investigations of duration of communicability based on in-person contact ('contact transmission'), isolation and culture of virus ('viral isolation'), and viral shedding by detection of nucleic acids by RT-PCR ('viral shedding') were identified through searches of peer-reviewed and pre-print health sciences literature databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, medRxiv and arXiv) and the grey literature. Articles were screened for relevance, then data were extracted, analyzed, and synthesized. Results: Out of the 165 studies included for qualitative analysis, one study investigated contact transmission, three investigated viral isolation, 144 investigated viral shedding, and 17 studies focused on both viral shedding and viral isolation. The median length of time until viral clearance across all viral isolation studies was nine days; however, the maximum identified duration was 32 days. Studies with data on both viral isolation and viral shedding showed a prolonged maximum time until viral clearance for viral shedding (9 days vs 24 days). Discussion: Findings from this review support a minimum 10-day period of isolation; however, additional observation should be considered for individuals being released into high-risk settings.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mina Park","author_inst":"Vancouver Coastal Health"},{"author_name":"Colleen Pawliuk","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Tribesty Nguyen","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Amanda Griffitt","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Linda Dix-Cooper","author_inst":"Vancouver Coastal Health"},{"author_name":"Nadia Fourik","author_inst":"Vancouver Coastal Health"},{"author_name":"Martin Dawes","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"David Mc Evoy","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

However, balancing the re-opening of society against the implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures needed for minimizing interpersonal contacts requires a careful assessment of the risks of infection as a function of the confinement relaxation strategies. Here, we present a stochastic coarse grained model that examines this problem. In our model, people are allowed to move between discrete positions on a one-dimensional grid with viral infection possible when two people are collocated at the same site. Our model features three sets of adjustable parameters, which characterize (i) viral transmission, (ii) viral detection, and (iii) degree of personal mobility, and as such, it is able to provide a qualitative assessment of the potential for second-wave infection outbreaks based on the timing, extent, and pattern of the lockdown relaxation strategy. In line with general expectations, our model predicts that a full lockdown yields the best results, namely, the lowest number of total infections. A less anticipated result was that when personal mobility is increased beyond a critical level, the risk of infection rapidly reaches a constant value, which depends solely on the population density. Furthermore, according to our model, confinement alone is not effective if it is not accompanied by a detection capacity (coupled with quarantine) that surpasses 40% of the patients during their symptomatic phase. The results of our simulation also showed that keeping the virus transmission probability to less than 0.4, which can be achieved in real life by respecting social distancing or wearing masks, is as effective as imposing a mild lockdown. Finally, we note that detection and quarantine of pre-symptomatic patients, even with a probability as low as 0.2, would reduce the final numbers of infections by a factor of ten or more.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiho Ando","author_inst":"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuki Matsuzawa","author_inst":"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hiromichi Tsurui","author_inst":"Juntendo University"},{"author_name":"Tetsuya Mizutani","author_inst":"Tokyo Noko Daigaku"},{"author_name":"Damien Hall","author_inst":"Nagoya Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Kuroda","author_inst":"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Aykut Ozkul","author_inst":"Ankara University"},{"author_name":"Urartu Ozgur Safak Seker","author_inst":"Bilkent University"},{"author_name":"Mitchell D Ramuta","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Cecilia G Shortreed","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Amelia K Haj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Anna S Heffron","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Matthew R Reynolds","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katrina N Fauser","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Corrie B Burmeister","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Kristi L Hall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katelyn A.
