Design and setting: Cross sectional study involving secondary analysis of publicly available data from a global online COVID-19 survey and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Participants: 106,497 participants from 58 countries. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were a worries index and a depression index. Predictors were stringency of policies, trust in government, and gender. Multivariable regression was conducted to determine the three-way interaction between the predictor variables for mental health outcomes, adjusting for age, income and education. Results: The median age of participants (56.4% women) was 37 years (interquartile range 29 to 48 years). Women had higher worries and depression scores than men. 45.4% distrusted the government and 43.8% trusted the government to take care of its citizens. Among those who strongly trusted the government, an increase in the stringency of policies was associated with a significant increase in the worries index. Among men who distrusted the government, an increase in policy stringency was associated with an increase in the depression index but not the worries index. In women that strongly distrusted the government, there was an inversed U-shaped association between policy stringency and both the worries and depression indices. Conclusion: As the stringency of public health measures increases, so too do depression and worries. The association is moderated by gender and trust in government. For safe and effective public health measures, governments should develop strategies to increase trust in their actions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lily O'Hara","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Zumin Shi","author_inst":"Qatar University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20155242","rel_title":"Genetic inhibition of interleukin-6 receptor signaling and Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-07-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.17.20155242","rel_abs":"There are few effective therapeutic options for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Early evidence has suggested that IL-6R blockers may confer benefit, particularly in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We leveraged large-scale human genetic data to investigate whether IL6-R blockade may confer therapeutic benefit in Covid-19. A genetic instrument consisting of seven genetic variants in or close to IL6R was recently shown to be linked to altered levels of c-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, circulating IL-6 and soluble IL-6R, concordant to known effects of pharmacological IL-6R blockade. We investigated the effect of these IL6R variants on risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 and other SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes using data from The Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The IL6R variants were strongly associated with serum CRP levels in UK Biobank. Meta-analysis of scaled estimates revealed a lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR 0.93 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.90-0.96, P = 9.5 x 10-7), recapitulating this established indication for IL-6R blockers (e.g. tocilizumab and sarilumab). The IL-6R instrument was associated with lower risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 (OR 0.88 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.78-0.99, P = 0.03). We found a consistent association when using a population-based control group (i.e. all non-cases; OR 0.91 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.87-0.96, P = 4.9 x 10-4). Evaluation of further SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes suggested association with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of association with Covid-19 complicated by death or requiring respiratory support. We performed several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings. Our results serve as genetic evidence for the potential efficacy of IL-6R blockade in Covid-19. Ongoing large-scale RCTs of IL-6R blockers will be instrumental in identifying the settings, including stage of disease, in which these agents may be effective.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonas Bovijn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cecilia M.

K18 hACE2-transgenic mice succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 6, with virus detected in lung airway epithelium and brain. K18 ACE2-transgenic mice produced a modest TH1\/2\/17 cytokine storm in the lung and spleen that peaked by day 2, and an extended chemokine storm that was detected in both lungs and brain. This chemokine storm was also detected in the brain at day 4. K18 hACE2-transgenic mice are, therefore, highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and represent a suitable animal model for the study of viral pathogenesis, and for identification and characterization of vaccines (prophylactic) and antivirals (therapeutics) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated severe COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatai Oladunni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jun-Gyu Park","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Paula Pino Tamayo","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Olga Gonzalez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anwari Ahkter","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Allue Guardia","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Angelica Olmo-Fontanez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shalini Gautam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Andreu Garcia Vilanova","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Chengjin Ye","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chiem","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colwyn Headley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Varun Dwivedi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Parodi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kendra Alfson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Schami","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Juan Garcia","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alison Whigham","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Roy Neal Platt","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michal Gazi","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.18.210161","rel_title":"An autocrine Vitamin D-driven Th1 shutdown program can be exploited for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.18.210161","rel_abs":"Pro-inflammatory immune responses are necessary for effective pathogen clearance, but cause severe tissue damage if not shut down in a timely manner1,2. Excessive complement and IFN-{gamma}-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-{gamma}+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5-7. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reuben McGregor","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Chauss","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Tilo Freiwald","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Bingyu Yan","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Luopin Wang","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Estefania Nova-Lamperti","author_inst":"University of Concepcion"},{"author_name":"Zonghao Zhang","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Heather Teague","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Erin West","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Jack Bibby","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Amna Malik","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Freeman","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Daniella Schwartz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Didier Portilla","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michail S Lionakis","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Nehal N Mehta","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Claudia Kemper","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154286","rel_title":"A privacy-preserving Bayesian network model for personalised COVID19 risk assessment and contact tracing","rel_date":"2020-07-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154286","rel_abs":"Concerns about the practicality and effectiveness of using Contact Tracing Apps (CTA) to reduce the spread of COVID19 have been well documented and, in the UK, led to the abandonment of the NHS CTA shortly after its release in May 2020.

We present a causal probabilistic model (a Bayesian network) that provides the basis for a practical CTA solution that does not compromise privacy. Users of the model can provide as much or little personal information as they wish about relevant risk factors, symptoms, and recent social interactions. The model then provides them feedback about the likelihood of the presence of asymptotic, mild or severe COVID19 (past, present and projected). When the model is embedded in a smartphone app, it can be used to detect new outbreaks in a monitored population and identify outbreak locations as early as possible. For this purpose, the only data needed to be centrally collected is the probability the user has COVID19 and the GPS location.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Norman Fenton","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Scott McLachlan","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Peter Lucas","author_inst":"University of Twente, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Kudakwashe Dube","author_inst":"Massey University, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Graham Hitman","author_inst":"Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Magda Osman","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Kyrimi","author_inst":"Queen Mary University"},{"author_name":"Martin Neil","author_inst":"Queen Mary, University of London and Agena Ltd"},{"author_name":"Erin West","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Jack Bibby","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Amna Malik","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Freeman","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Daniella Schwartz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Didier Portilla","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michail S Lionakis","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Nehal N Mehta","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Claudia Kemper","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155747","rel_title":"Barriers to online learning in the time of COVID-19: A national survey of medical students in the Philippines","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155747","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced medical schools in the Philippines to stop face-to-face learning activities and abruptly shift to an online curriculum. This study aimed to identify barriers to online learning from the perspective of medical students in a developing country. METHODS The authors sent out an electronic survey to medical students in the Philippines from 11 to 24 May 2020. Using a combination of multiple choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions, the following data were obtained: demographics, medical school information, access to technological resources, study habits, living conditions, self-assessment of capacity for and perceived barriers to online learning, and proposed interventions. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Responses were compared between student subgroups using nonparametric tests. RESULTS Among 3,670 medical students, 3,421 (93%) owned a smartphone and 3,043 (83%) had a laptop or desktop computer. To access online resources, 2,916 (79%) had a postpaid internet subscription while 696 (19%) used prepaid mobile data. Under prevailing conditions, only 1,505 students (41%) considered themselves physically and mentally capable of engaging in online learning. Barriers were classified under five categories: technological, individual, domestic, institutional, and community barriers. Most frequently encountered were difficulty adjusting learning styles, having to perform responsibilities at home, and poor communication between educators and learners. DISCUSSION Medical students in the Philippines confronted several interrelated barriers as they tried to adapt to online learning. By implementing student-centered interventions, medical schools and educators play a significant role in addressing these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronnie E Baticulon","author_inst":"Department of Anatomy, University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicole Rose I Alberto","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Beatriz C Baron","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Earl C Mabulay","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lloyd Gabriel T Rizada","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jinno Jenkin Sy","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christl Jan S Tiu","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlie A Clarion","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Philippine General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Carlo B Reyes","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, University of the Philippines College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jack Bibby","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Amna Malik","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Freeman","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Daniella Schwartz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Didier Portilla","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michail S Lionakis","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Nehal N Mehta","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Claudia Kemper","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20155994","rel_title":"Effect of corticosteroid treatment on 1376 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. Results: One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids.In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p <0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p <0.001). Conclusions: Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders.

We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The within-day and between-day precisions were regarded as good, since the coefficient variations were below 5%. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU\/mL and 112.7 AU\/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU\/mL and 55.3 AU\/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM\/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this measurement system is sufficient for use in laboratory testing.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"RIn Yokoyama","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kurano","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yoshifumi Morita","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takuya Shimura","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuki Nakano","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chungen Qian","author_inst":"Huazhong Universityof Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Fan He","author_inst":"ShenzhenYHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kishi","author_inst":"Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jun Okada","author_inst":"Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Naoyuki Yoshikawa","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Nagura","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Okazaki","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kyoji Moriya","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Seto","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tatsuhiko Kodama","author_inst":"Laboratory for Systems Biology and Medicine, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Yatomi","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155853","rel_title":"SARS-Cov-2 cysteine-like protease (Mpro) is immunogenic and can be detected in serum and saliva of COVID-19-seropositive individuals","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155853","rel_abs":"Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification of individuals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are based on serum detection of antibodies to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralising antibodies) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that are known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of antigens released from infected cells could stimulate antibody responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other non-structural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titre IgG, IgM and IgA antibody responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher antibody titres in these assays associated with more severe disease and no cross-reactive antibodies against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG antibodies specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 antigens can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent antigen in infected patients that can be used in serological tests and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonz\u00e1lez-\u00c1lvaro","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 M Casasnovas","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez Soto","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Gloria Esteso","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Yaiza C\u00e1ceres-Martell","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Sof\u00eda Gardeta","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Salom\u00e9 Prat","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Tamara Mateu-Alberoa","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo L\u00f3pez-Granados","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz"},{"author_name":"Francisco S\u00e1nchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 M Rodr\u00edguez-Frade","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Hugh T Reyburn","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Mar Val\u00e9s-G\u00f3mez","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Yatomi","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20155846","rel_title":"Association between consumption of vegetables and COVID-19 mortality at a country level in Europe","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.17.20155846","rel_abs":"Background Many foods have an antioxidant activity, and nutrition may mitigate COVID-19. To test the potential role of vegetables in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of Brassica vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, head cabbage (white, red and savoy cabbage), leafy brassica) and to compare them with spinach, cucumber, courgette, lettuce and tomato. The COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants was obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people over 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage of obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only head cabbage and cucumber reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g\/day increase in the average national consumption of some of the vegetables (head cabbage and cucumber), the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by a factor of 11, down to 13.6 %. Lettuce consumption increased COVID-19 mortality. The adjustment did not change the point estimate and the results were still significant. Discussion The negative ecological association between COVID-19 mortality and the consumption of cabbage and cucumber supports the a priori hypothesis previously reported. The hypothesis needs to be tested in individual studies performed in countries where the consumption of vegetables is common.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susana C Fonseca","author_inst":"GreenUPorto - Sustainable Agrifood Production Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Ioar Rivas","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Dora Romaguera","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Marcos Quijal-Zamorano","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Wienczyslawa Czarlewski","author_inst":"Medical Consulting Czarlewski ; MASK-air"},{"author_name":"Alain Vidal","author_inst":"World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)"},{"author_name":"Joao A Fonseca","author_inst":"CINTESIS, Center for Research in Health Technology and Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Joan Ballester","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Josep M Anto","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Xavier Basagana","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Luis M Cunha","author_inst":"GreenUPorto - Sustainable Agrifood Production Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Jean Bousquet","author_inst":"MACVIA-France"},{"author_name":"Francisco S\u00e1nchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 M Rodr\u00edguez-Frade","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Hugh T Reyburn","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Mar Val\u00e9s-G\u00f3mez","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Yatomi","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155739","rel_title":"Development and Validation of a Web-Based Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Model","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155739","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) carries high morbidity and mortality globally. Identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration upon presentation would aid in triaging, prognostication, and allocation of resources and experimental treatments. Research Question: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and\/or death? Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%). Results: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated into a mobile-friendly website. Interpretation: This web-based risk prediction model can be used at the bedside for prediction of severe COVID-19 using data mostly available at the time of presentation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sang Hoon Woo","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University"},{"author_name":"Arturo J.

We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system. Methods: Outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review. Results: 1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 165 (16.1%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. At the time of data censoring, 63\/165 patients (38.1%) had died and 102\/165 (61.8%) were still alive. Of the surviving 102 patients, 17 (10.3%) remained on mechanical ventilation, 51 (30.9%) were extubated but remained hospitalized, and 34 (20.6%) had been discharged. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001). 75.7% of patients over 70 years old had died at the time of data analysis. Conversely, 71.2% of patients age 70 or younger were still alive at the time of data analysis. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status. Conclusion: Mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher King","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax"},{"author_name":"Dhwani Sahjwani","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"A Whitney Brown","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Saad Feroz","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paula Cameron","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erik Osborn","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mehul Desai","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Svetolik Djurkovic","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aditya Kasarabada","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hinerman","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Lantry","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Oksana Shlobin","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kareem Ahmad","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Khangoora","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shambhu Aryal","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"A Claire Collins","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alan Speir","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steven Nathan","author_inst":"Inova Fairfax Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155382","rel_title":"Identifying organ dysfunction trajectory-based subphenotypes in critically ill patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155382","rel_abs":"Rationale. COVID-19-associated respiratory failure offers the unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the differential host response to a uniform pathogenic insult. Prior studies of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have identified subphenotypes with differential outcomes. Understanding whether there are distinct subphenotypes of severe COVID-19 may offer insight into its pathophysiology. Objectives. To identify and characterize distinct subphenotypes of COVID-19 critical illness defined by the post-intubation trajectory of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Methods. Intubated COVID-19 patients at two hospitals in New York city were leveraged as development and validation cohorts. Patients were grouped into mild, intermediate, and severe strata by their baseline post-intubation SOFA. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed within each stratum to detect subphenotypes based on similarities amongst SOFA score trajectories evaluated by Dynamic Time Warping. Statistical tests defined trajectory subphenotype predictive markers. Measurements and Main Results. Distinct worsening and recovering subphenotypes were identified within each stratum, which had distinct 7-day post-intubation SOFA progression trends. Patients in the worsening suphenotypes had a higher mortality than those in the recovering subphenotypes within each stratum (mild stratum, 29.7% vs. 10.3%, p=0.033; intermediate stratum, 29.3% vs. 8.0%, p=0.002; severe stratum, 53.7% vs. 22.2%, p<0.001). Worsening and recovering subphenotypes were replicated in the validation cohort. Routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and respiratory variables rather than demographics and comorbidities were predictive of the worsening and recovering subphenotypes. Conclusions. There are clear worsening and recovering subphenotypes of COVID-19 respiratory failure after intubation, which are more predictive of outcomes than baseline severity of illness. Organ dysfunction trajectory may be well suited as a surrogate for research in COVID-19 respiratory failure.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chang Su","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhenxing Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Katherine Hoffman","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Parag Goyal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

Once a region has successfully contained the disease, it becomes critical to decide when and how to reopen the borders. Here we explore the impact of border reopening for the example of Newfoundland and Labrador, a Canadian province that has enjoyed no new cases since late April, 2020. We combine a network epidemiology model with machine learning to infer parameters and predict the COVID-19 dynamics upon partial and total airport reopening, with perfect and imperfect quarantine conditions. Our study suggests that upon full reopening, every other day, a new COVID-19 case would enter the province. Under the current conditions, banning air travel from outside Canada is more efficient in managing the pandemic than fully reopening and quarantining 95% of the incoming population. Our study provides quantitative insights of the efficacy of travel restrictions and can inform political decision making in the controversy of reopening.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Proton Rahman","author_inst":"Memorial University"},{"author_name":"Alain Goriely","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

Individuals in both A and I may go directly to an immune class V, and in I to a dead class D. Upon this SCLAIV formulation we impose a set of drivers that can be used to develop policy to manage current Covid-19 and similar type disease outbreaks. These drivers include surveillance, social distancing (rate and efficacy), social relaxation, quarantining (linked to contact tracing), patient treatment\/isolation and vaccination processes that can either be a non-negative constant or an s-shaped switching curve. The latter are defined in terms of onset and switching times, initial and final values, and abruptness of switching. We built a Covid-19 NMB-DASA web app to generate both deterministic and stochastic solutions to our SCLAIV and drivers model and use incidence and mortality data to provide both maximum-likelihood frequentist and Bayesian fitting of parameters. In the context of South African and English Covid-19 incidence data we demonstrate how to both identify and evaluate the role of drivers in ongoing outbreaks. In particular, we show that early social distancing in South Africa likely averted around 80,000 observed cases (actual number is double if only half the case are observed) during the months of June and July. We also demonstrated that incidence rates in South Africa will increase to between a conservative estimate of 15 and 30 thousand observed cases per day (again, actual number considerably higher) by the end of August if stronger social distancing measures are not effected during July and August, 2020. On different a note, we show that comparably good local optimal fits of the English data using surveillance, social distancing and social relaxation drivers can represent very different kinds of outbreaks---one with close to 90% and another with under 8% immune individuals. This latter result provides a cautionary tale of why fitting SEIR-like models to incidence or prevalence data can be extremely problematic when not anchored by other critical measures, such as levels of immunity in the population. Our presentation illustrates how our Covid-19 web app can be used by individuals without any programming skills to carry out forensic and scenario analyses in spatially contained populations such as small countries or metropolitan areas.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wayne M Getz","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley, Dept ESPM"},{"author_name":"Ludovica Luisa-Vissat","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley, Dept ESPM"},{"author_name":"Richard Salter","author_inst":"Oberlin College, Dept Computer Science"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

This study provides admission rates to hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) in Norway, aiming to better understand the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: Data from official reports from The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health were used to calculate admission rates to hospitals and to ICU per 100 000 inhabitants. We compared rates of hospitalisation between the four health regions and provide separate rates for Oslo. We also assessed national admissions to ICU stratified by age. Results: The admission rate in the south-eastern region was 3.1 per 100 000, and the rate for Oslo was 5.8. Compared to the western region (reference), the Oslo rate was 4.0 times (confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.5) higher. In Norway as a whole, the rate of ICU admissions was 3.9 per 100 000, and in the age groups 60-69 and 70-79, ICU rates were 10.3 and 11.5, respectively. These rates were 9.5 (CI 6.3-14.3) and 10.6 (CI 6.9-16.2) times higher compared to people younger than 50 years. Conclusion: Hospital admissions due to Covid-19 are much higher in Oslo than anywhere else in Norway, and in the country as a whole, ICU admissions are highest among people 60-79 years of age. These results and more detailed data could provide better advice on how restrictions can be safely lessened.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morten Munkvik","author_inst":"University of Stavanger"},{"author_name":"Ingvild Vatten Alsnes","author_inst":"University og Stavanger"},{"author_name":"Lars Vatten","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Monika M Safford","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jerry Lee","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alvarez-Mulett","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Luis Gomez-Escobar","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"David R Price","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"John S Harrington","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lisa K Torres","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fernando J Martinez","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Campion Jr.","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rainu Kaushal","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Augustine M.K.

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. Methods From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety\/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Results Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and other clinical staff (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Factors significantly protective for burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Max Denning","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ee Teng Goh","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Almonte","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Scott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155887","rel_title":"An overview of current mental health in the general population of Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the COLLATE project","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155887","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses significant mental health challenges globally; however, to date, there is limited community level data. This study reports on the first wave of data from the COLLATE project (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy), an ongoing study aimed at understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Australians. This paper addresses prevailing primary concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, current levels of negative emotions and risk factors predicting these negative emotions. On April 1st to 4th 2020, 5158 adult members of the Australian general public completed an online survey. Participants ranked their top ten current primary concerns about COVID-19, and completed standardized measures to ascertain levels of negative emotions (specifically, depression, anxiety and stress). Socio-demographic information was also collected and used in the assessment of risk factors. The top three primary concerns were all related to the health and well-being of family and loved ones. As expected, levels of negative emotion were exceptionally high. Modelling of predictors of negative emotions established several risk factors related to demographic variables, personal vulnerabilities, financial stresses, and social distancing experiences; particularly being young, being female, or having a mental illness diagnosis. The data provides important characterization of the current mental health of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critically, it appears that specific groups in the Australian community may need special attention to ensure their mental health is protected during these difficult times. The data further suggests the need for immediate action to combat high levels of psychological distress, along with the exacerbation of mental health conditions, in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. These results may provide some direction for international researchers hoping to characterize similar issues in other countries.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susan Rossell","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Erica Neill","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Andrea Phillipou","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Eric Tan","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Toh","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Tamsyn Van Rheenen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denny Meyer","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155457","rel_title":"Is population anxiety associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths?

Anxiety can be seen as a manifestation of a nocebo context. The psychological stress of the COVID-19 pandemic led some people to experience COVID-19 symptoms, which were not actually related to a COVID-19 infection. A fundamental goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is to limit the COVID-19 related demand on healthcare systems and to minimize COVID-19 related deaths. This exploratory study aims to determine to what extent the anxiety in the population is related to the number of covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths. METHODS We will quantify the magnitude of the relationship between population anxiety and hospitalizations \/ deaths. Anxiety will be assessed using the results of the most frequently used anxiety measuring scale. Official websites of governments will be screened to determine hospitalizations and deaths. Studies will be included if they had at least 100 respondents, used a validated anxiety scale, reported on the general population of a country, and were conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic. A search strategy will take into account the limited resources for this study and will be used to search Pubmed, MedRXiv and PsychRXiv. Screening will take place at two levels: abstracts and titles, followed by full text reports. One researcher will extract data which will be double checked by a second researcher. We will perform weighted OLS regression to quantify the relationship of anxiety and covid-19 related hospitalizations \/ deaths. DISCUSSION Covid-19 related measures can carry a significant social cost and risk of unwanted effects; it is therefore important to assess the extent to which anxiety in the population is related to covid-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. If anxiety can be properly reduced in the population, health care will be safeguarded. Thus, any strategy that reduces anxiety can then be included in evidence-based decision making.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederik Feys","author_inst":"Independent"},{"author_name":"Abdallah Naser","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University Jordan\/Amman"},{"author_name":"Andrea Phillipou","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Eric Tan","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Toh","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Tamsyn Van Rheenen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denny Meyer","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155515","rel_title":"Are countries precautionary actions against COVID-19 effective?

Numerous countries have attempted to employ precautions to address this pandemic. Objective This study was aimed at exploring and assessing the precautionary actions taken by 175 countries on six continents to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods An observational study was conducted based on data collected during the period from December 31, 2019, until the end of April 2020. Several data were extracted, including information related to the date of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, total confirmed cases, total active cases, and more. In addition, seven validated indicators were used to assess the countries preparedness and precautionary actions. Results A total of 175 countries were included in the study. The total COVID-19 infection rate increased exponentially and rapidly in North America and Europe from March to April. The application of the precautions (indicators) varied between countries. School closures, quarantines and curfews were the most applied indicators among all countries. As for the relationship between the indicators and their effects on the infection rate, Italy and Spain were the top countries in Europe and adopted all indicators. Nevertheless, they faced high infection rates: 239,639 and 205,463 COVID-19 cases in Spain, and Italy, respectively. Conclusion The precautionary actions might have played a role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in several countries. However, many countries did not benefit from applying these indicators.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Food and Drug Authority, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khalidah Alenzi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fatemah Alnofal","author_inst":"Saudi Food and Drug Authority, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ghada Fradees","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Alqassim, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ali Altebainawi","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Ministry of Health, Hail, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Tamsyn Van Rheenen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denny Meyer","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155523","rel_title":"The impact of climate temperature on counts, recovery, and death rates due to SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa.","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155523","rel_abs":"The impact of climate temperature on the counts (number of positive COVID-19 cases reported), recovery, and death rates of COVID-19 cases in all of South Africa's 9 provinces was investigated.

Our result indicates that a higher or lower climate temperature does not prevent or delay the spread and death rates but shows significant positive impacts on the recovery rates of COVID-19 patients. Thus, it indicates that the climate temperature is unlikely to impose a strict limit on the spread of COVID-19. There is no correlation between the cases and death rates, an indicator that no particular temperature range is closely associated with a faster or slower death rate of COVID-19 patients. As evidence from our study, a warm climate temperature can only increase the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients, ultimately impacting the death and active case rates and freeing up resources quicker to enable health facilities to deal with the climbing rates of those patients who need treatment.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Prof.  Naven Chetty","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Dr. Bamise Adeleye","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Abiola Olawale Ilori","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal"},{"author_name":"Ghada Fradees","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Alqassim, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ali Altebainawi","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Ministry of Health, Hail, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Tamsyn Van Rheenen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Denny Meyer","author_inst":"Swinburne University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155630","rel_title":"Emerging Mental Health Challenges, Strategies and Opportunities in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives from South American Decision-makers.","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155630","rel_abs":"Background Mental health awareness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although international guidelines address the mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) response to emergencies, regional recommendations on COVID-19 are still insufficient. We identified emerging mental health problems, strategies to address them, and opportunities to reform mental health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to mental health decision-makers of Ministries of Health in 10 South American countries in mid-April 2020. The semi-structured questionnaire had 12 questions clustered into 3 main sections: emerging challenges in mental health, current and potential strategies to face the pandemic, and, key elements for mental health reform. We identified keywords and themes for each section through summative content analysis. Findings An increasing mental health burden and emerging needs are arising as direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic among health care providers and the general population. National lockdowns challenge the delivery and access to mental health treatment and care. Strategies to meet these health needs rely heavily on timely and adequate responses by strengthened mental health governance and systems, availability of services, virtual platforms, and appropriate capacity building for service providers. Short- and medium-term strategies focused on bolstering community-based mental health networks and telemedicine for high-risk populations. Opportunities for long-term mental health reform entail strengthening legal frameworks, redistribution of financial resources and collaboration with local and international partners. Interpretation Mental health and psychosocial support have been identified as a priority area by South American countries in the COVID-19 response. The pandemic has generated specific needs that require appropriate actions including: implementing virtual based interventions, orienting capacity building towards protection of users and health providers, strengthening evidence-driven decision making and integrating MHPSS in high-level mechanisms guiding the response to COVID-19.

Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets we can assess the relative contribution of aerosols in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total numbers and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing from healthy subjects. Dynamic modelling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows to account for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces. The probability of infection by inhalation of aerosols when breathing in the same space can then be estimated using current estimates of viral load and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In line with the current known reproduction numbers, our study of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that aerosol transmission is an inefficient route, in particular from non or mildly symptomatic individuals.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Bonn","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Scott Howard Smith","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Aernout Somsen","author_inst":"Cardiology Centers of the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Cees van Rijn","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Stefan Kooij","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Lia van der Hoek","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam - AMC"},{"author_name":"Reinout A Bem","author_inst":"Amsterdam University Medical Centers"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Hui Sia","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Ying Xian Chua","author_inst":"Pioneer Polyclinic, National University Polyclinics, National University Health System, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155481","rel_title":"The properties of hot household hygroscopic materials and their potential use for non-medical facemask decontamination","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155481","rel_abs":"The wide use of facemasks through the population to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission, and its resulting mis- or even non-decontamination are challenging the management of the epidemic at a large scale.

The responses of specific immune cell populations to the disease remain poorly defined, which hinders improvements in treatment and care management. Here, we utilized mass cytometry (CyTOF) to thoroughly phenotype peripheral myeloid cells and T lymphocytes from 30 convalescent patients with mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19. We identified 10 clusters of monocytes and dendritic cells and 17 clusters of T cells. Examination of these clusters revealed that both CD14+CD16+ intermediate and CD14dimCD16+ nonclassical monocytes, as well as CD4+ stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells, correlated with COVID-19 severity, coagulation factor levels, and\/or inflammatory indicators. We also identified two nonclassical monocyte subsets distinguished by expression of the sugar residue 6-Sulfo LacNac (Slan). One of these subsets (Slanlo, nMo1) was depleted in moderately and severely ill patients, while the other (Slanhi, nMo2) increased with disease severity and was linked to CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cell frequencies, coagulation factors, and inflammatory indicators. Intermediate monocytes tightly correlated with loss of naive T cells as well as an increased abundance of effector memory T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our data suggest that both intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets shape the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study provides both broad and in-depth characterization of immune cell phenotypes in response to COVID-19 and suggests functional interactions between distinct cell types during the disease.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUse of mass cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients allows correlation of distinct monocyte and T lymphocyte subsets with clinical factors.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lindsey E.

As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) - a pro-nociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A\/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A\/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the first documented cases of severe lung disease COVID-19. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is a positive-strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells. From sequencing three isolates, we derive a robust identification of SARS-CoV-2 modification sites within a physiologically relevant host cell type. A comparison of our data with the DRS data from a previous SARS-CoV-2 isolate, both raised in monkey renal cells, reveals consistent RNA modifications across the viral genome. Conservation of the RNA modification pattern during progression of the current pandemic suggests that this pattern is likely essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and represents a possible target for drug interventions.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Milad Miladi","author_inst":"University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Jonas Fuchs","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Maier","author_inst":"University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Weigang","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Nuria Diaz i Pedrosa","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lisa Weiss","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Achim Lother","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Anton Nekrutenko","author_inst":"The Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Ruzsics","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Marcus Panning","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Georg Kochs","author_inst":"University Medical Center Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Ralf Gilsbach","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Bjoern Andreas Gruening","author_inst":"University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Khanna","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Kang Sim","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, YLLSoM, NUS"},{"author_name":"Lucas Lim","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Tan","author_inst":"Division of Healthy Ageing, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Melanie Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vijay Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM), National University of Singapore (NUS)"},{"author_name":"Shirley Ooi","author_inst":"Emergency Medicine Department, NUH, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Zbikowska","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jaroslaw Fedorowski","author_inst":"Polish Hospital Federation, Poland"},{"author_name":"Grazyna Dykowska","author_inst":"Department of Economics of Health and Medical Law, Medical University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genetics"}]}
