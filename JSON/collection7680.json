Adapting the classical epidemic modelling framework, two distinct routes of COVID-19 transmission are incorporated into a model: (a) direct person-to-person contact transmission, and (b) indirect airborne and fomites-driven transmission. The indirect non-contact transmission route needs to explored in models of COVID-19 spread, because evidences show that this route of transmission is entirely viable with hugely uncertain level of relative contribution. This theoretical study based on model simulations demonstrates the following: (1) Not incorporating indirect transmission route in the model leads to underestimation of the basic reproduction number, and hence will impact on the COVID-19 mitigation decisions; (2) Lockdown measures can suppress the primary infection peak, but will lead to a secondary peak whose relative strength and time of occurrence depend on the success and duration of the lockdown measures; (3) To make lockdown effective, a considerable level of reduction in both contact and non-contact transmission rates over a long period is required; (4) To bring down the infection cases below any hypothetical health-care capacity, reduction of non-contact transmission rate is key, and hence active measures should be taken to reduce non-contact transmission (e.g., extensive uses of areal and aerosol disinfectant in public spaces to improve contaminated surfaces and air); (5) Any premature withdrawal of lockdown following the sign of a brief retracement in the infection cases can backfire, and can lead to a quicker, sharper and higher secondary peak, due to reactivation of the two transmission routes. Based on these results, this study recommends that any exit policy from lockdown, should take into account the level of transmission reduction in both routes, the absolute scale of which will vary among countries depending on their health-service capacity, but should be computed using accurate time-series data on infection cases and transmission rates.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shovonlal Roy","author_inst":"University of Reading"},{"author_name":"Mehak Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vishwesh Bharadiya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Parul Berry","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mudit Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohak Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Giridara Gopal Parameswaran","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Raebareli"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20050427","rel_title":"Fast spread of COVID-19 in Europe and the US and its implications: even modest public health goals require comprehensive intervention","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20050427","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused more than 800,000 infections and 40,000 deaths by the end of March 2020.

The objective of this study was to predict the risk of positive COVID-19 diagnosis with machine learning, using as predictors only results from emergency care admission exams. We collected data from a sample of 235 adult patients from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 17 to 30 of March, 2020, of which 102 (43%) received a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 from RT-PCR tests. Five machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting trees, logistic regression and support vector machines) were trained on a random sample of 70% of the patients, and performance was tested on new unseen data (30%). The best predictive performance was obtained by the support vector machines algorithm (AUC: 0.85; Sensitivity: 0.68; Specificity: 0.85; Brier Score: 0.16).

However, whether SD alone is enough to flatten the epidemic curve is debatable. Using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model, we investigated the impact of increasing SD, hospital beds and COVID-19 detection rates in preventing COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Research Design and Methods: The Stochastic Simulation Model was built using the EpiModel package in R. As a proof of concept study, we ran the simulation on Kasaragod, the most affected district in Kerala. We added 3 compartments to the SEIR model to obtain a SEIQHRF (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalised-Recovered-Fatal) model. Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half). Conclusions: An effective strategy to contain the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India is to increase detection rates in combination with SD measures and increase in hospital beds.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pramit Ghosh","author_inst":"Purulia Government Medical College, Purulia, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Salah Basheer","author_inst":"Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Kozhikode, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Sandip Paul","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Partha Chakrabarti","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Jit Sarkar","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Mohak Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Giridara Gopal Parameswaran","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Raebareli"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20053918","rel_title":"Thoughts on Higher Medical Education Under Major Public Health Emergencies: Thinking Ahead After COVID-19 Outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20053918","rel_abs":"Objective: To explore the most suitable teaching and learning pattern in medical school during COVID-19 Outbreak. Design: This study is a case-control study. We had tried to apply a new blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction to the students before the outbreak and then universities responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by closing campuses and shifting to other forms of distance learning. In other word, the courses started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Five Point Likert Scale Questionnaires which contains 20 items were used, and the effect of the two kinds of teaching patterns was compared by evaluating the indicators of core competencies of students including professionalism, attitude towards learning, knowledge and learning skills, teamwork skills, motivation in learning, adaptability and acceptance of the courses and network environment. Setting: Our study based on a single center. Participants: Fifty fourth-year medical students receiving the 5+3 pattern courses regarding internal medicine were enrolled in the study. Exposure(s) :The teaching and learning patter started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Main Outcome: According to the descriptive statistical analysis of the first part of the questionnaire (question 1-16), the average score of adaptability and acceptance of the courses is 2.60 lower than 3, indicating that students are more adapted to other forms of distance learning during COVID-19 outbreak; the average score of the rest of the questions is higher than 3, indicating that blended teaching model based on 5G network is superior to other forms of distance learning. The number of male students who are inclined to the blended teaching model based on 5G network is 0.13 times as much as that of female students (95%CI:0.028~0.602, p=0.009). Results: Online forms of distance learning were accepted by the students. Female students had higher expectations on the course and were more likely to adapt well to the change during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, all students preferred the blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction before the pandemic.

On January 21, 2020, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center and the WHO released its first situation report about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sparking significant media attention. How Twitter content and sentiment has evolved in the early stages of any outbreak, including the COVID-19 epidemic, has not been described. Objective: To quantify and understand early changes in Twitter activity, content, and sentiment about the COVID-19 epidemic. Design: Observational study. Setting: Twitter platform. Participants: All Twitter users who created or sent a message from January 14th to 28th, 2020. Measurements: We extracted tweets matching hashtags related to COVID-19 and measured frequency of keywords related to infection prevention practices, vaccination, and racial prejudice. We performed a sentiment analysis to identify emotional valence and predominant emotions. We conducted topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. Results: We evaluated 126,049 tweets from 53,196 unique users. The hourly number of COVID-19-related tweets starkly increased from January 21, 2020 onward. Nearly half (49.5%) of all tweets expressed fear and nearly 30% expressed surprise. The frequency of racially charged tweets closely paralleled the number of newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19. The economic and political impact of the COVID-19 was the most commonly discussed topic, while public health risk and prevention were among the least discussed. Conclusion: Tweets with negative sentiment and emotion parallel the incidence of cases for the COVID-19 outbreak. Twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to understand public sentiment in real-time and target public health messages based on user interest and emotion.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard J.

As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS CoV 2. Methods and findings We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions.

However, SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown discernible variability across the globe. While in some countries people are recovering relatively quickly, in others, recovery times have been comparatively longer and number of individuals succumbing to it are high. This variability in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility is suggestive of a likely association between the genetic make up of affected individuals modulated by their ancestry and the severity of COVID-19 manifestations. Objective In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential association between an individual's genetic ancestry and the extent of COVID-19 disease presentation employing Europeans as the case study. In addition, using a genome wide association (GWAS) approach we sought to discern the putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and genes that may be likely associated with differential COVID-19 manifestations by comparative analyses of the European and East Asian genomes. Method To this end, we employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597,573 SNPs obtained from the databank of Dr. David Reich, Harvard Medical School, USA to evaluate the likely correlation between European ancestry and COVID-19 manifestations. Ancestry proportions were determined using qpAdm program implemented in AdmixTools v5.1. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of European genomes and COVID-19 death\/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated. Genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed in PLINK v1.9 to investigate SNPs with significant allele frequency variations among European and East Asian genomes that likely correlated with differential COVID-19 infectivity. Results We found significant positive correlation (r=0.58, P=0.03) between West European hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death\/recovery ratio for data as of 5th April 2020. This association discernibly amplified (r=0.77, P=0.009) upon reanalyses based on data as of 30th June 2020, removing countries with small sample sizes and adding those that are a bridge between Europe and Asia. Using GWAS we further identified 404 immune response related SNPs by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries. Prominently, we identified that SNPs associated with immune-system related pathways such as interferon stimulated antiviral response, adaptive and innate immune system and IL-6 dependent immune responses show significant differences in allele frequencies [Chi square values (Chi square values >1500; P=0)] between Europeans and East Asians. Conclusion So far, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the likely association between host genetic ancestry and COVID-19 severity. These findings improve our overall understanding of the putative genetic modifiers of COVID-19 clinical presentation. We note that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from more detailed analyses of individual genomic sequence data from COVID-19 patients of varied ancestries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ranajit Das","author_inst":"Yenepoya (Deemed to be University)"},{"author_name":"Sudeep D Ghate","author_inst":"Yenepoya Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University)"},{"author_name":"Manisha Chatterjee","author_inst":"Subharti Medical College Meerut"},{"author_name":"Neeladrisingha Das","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Deepjyoti Kalita","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Science Rishikesh"},{"author_name":"Partha Roy","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Soumitra Satapathi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Liyao Zong","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nengying Wang","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junping Wen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053058","rel_title":"Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053058","rel_abs":"Background: By early April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly one million people and had spread to nearly all countries worldwide. It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Methods: Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues. Results: Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases. Conclusions: All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Li LIU","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Zheng","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Danting Luo","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Soumitra Satapathi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Liyao Zong","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nengying Wang","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junping Wen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052860","rel_title":"Portable and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19: Combined use of the miniPCR thermocycler and a well-plate reader for SARS-Co2 virus detection","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052860","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has crudely demonstrated the need for massive and rapid diagnostics. By the first week of July, more than 10,000,000 positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, although this number could be greatly underestimated. In the case of an epidemic emergency, the first line of response should be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we demonstrate the use of the miniPCR, a commercial compact and portable PCR device recently available on the market, in combination with a commercial well-plate reader as a diagnostic system for detecting genetic material of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19. We used the miniPCR to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using the sets of initiators recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for targeting three different regions that encode for the N protein. Prior to amplification, samples were combined with a DNA intercalating reagent (i.e., EvaGreen Dye). Sample fluorescence after amplification was then read using a commercial 96-well plate reader. This straightforward method allows the detection and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2X105 DNA copies. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for COVID-19 pandemic testing, particularly in underdeveloped regions where RT-QPCR instrument availability may be limited. The portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of the miniPCR makes it a reliable alternative for deployment in point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during pandemics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Everardo Gonzalez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Grissel Trujillo-de Santiago","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Itzel Montserrat Lara-Mayorga","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Sergio Omar Martinez-Chapa","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Mario Moises Alvarez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Soumitra Satapathi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Liyao Zong","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nengying Wang","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junping Wen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053280","rel_title":"Longitudinal analysis of laboratory findings during the process of recovery for patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053280","rel_abs":"Objective To explore longitudinal change patterns of key laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and to identify independent prognostic factors by examining the associations between laboratory findings and outcomes of patients. Methods The multicenter study prospectively included 59 patients with COVID-19 treated at Jilin province from January 21, 2020 to May 5, 2020. Laboratory tests were included haematological, biochemical, and immunological tests. Results Laboratory findings, the characteristics of epidemiological and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records. Eosinopenia was shown in 52.6% cases at onset, and the average value of eosinophil continued to significantly increase thereafter. Lymphopenia was found in 40.4% cases at onset, and the average value of lymphocyte was slowly elevated after day 5. Thrombocytopenia was shown in 12.3% cases at onset, and the average value of mean platelet volume was decreased sharply after day 7. The values of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, creatinine kinase-muscle\/brain activity, and cardiac troponin I, serum cardiac markers, were beyond the upper limit of RI from 6.1% to 30.6% at onset. The abnormity of liver function tests, kidney function tests, electrolytes was 2.0%~59.2%, 2.0%~4.1%, 6.0%~30.0%, respectively. Eosinophil, platelet and carbondioxide combining power were selected as the prognostic factors. Conclusions The haematological, biochemical, and immunological tests were found significant abnormity at onset and longitudinal change patterns in the patients with COVID-19. Age, Eosinophil, PLT and CO2 may used to predict the recovery probability. Risk stratification and management could be improved for the patients with COVID-19 according to temporal trajectories of laboratory tests.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suyan Tian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Xuetong Zhu","author_inst":"First Hospital of Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Xuejuan Sun","author_inst":"Changchun Infectious Disease Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinmei Wang","author_inst":"Siping Infectious Disease Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"First Hospital of Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Chi Wang","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Jiancheng Xu","author_inst":"First Hospital of Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Nengying Wang","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junping Wen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20054338","rel_title":"Explaining the Bomb-Like Dynamics of COVID-19 with Modeling and the Implications for Policy","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20054338","rel_abs":"Using a Bayesian approach to epidemiological compartmental modeling, we demonstrate the bomb-like behavior of exponential growth in COVID-19 cases can be explained by transmission of asymptomatic and mild cases that are typically unreported at the beginning of pandemic events due to lower prevalence of testing.

Given the mounting evidence that potentially large fractions of the population are asymptomatic, the weaker priors that generate the high R0 values to fit the data required assumptions about the epidemiology of COVID-19 that do not fit with the biology, particularly regarding the timeframe that people remain infectious.

We dynamically measured those reported indicators in 132 cases of COVID-19 patients including the moderate-cured (moderated and cured), severe-cured (severe and cured) and critically ill (died). Our data showed that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. For disease classification, CRP and LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe (or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types. Collectively, we concluded that LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the precise classification and prognosis prediction are critical for saving the insufficient medical resources, stratified treatment and improving the survival rate of critically ill patients. We recommend that LYM% be used independently or in combination with other indicators in the management of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Li Tan","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Xia Kang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Xinran Ji","author_inst":"Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital (301 Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Qi Wang","author_inst":"General hospital of Central Threater Command,PRC"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng li","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Qiongshu Wang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Hongming Miao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Yupeng Yang","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Simon A Levin","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Eili Y Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"For the CDC MInD-Healthcare Program","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052878","rel_title":"Search for trends of Covid-19 infection in India, China, Denmark, Brazil, France.

NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs). However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications. It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of virus spreading. We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states. Based on an extended infection-epidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of COVID-19 spreading in different regions of Italy, we found that the reproduction number was decreased to a range below 1 in all federal states. The development in Germany suggests that NPIs can be partially released based on an established new culture of social distancing, face masks and mutual care within the population. However, any release of measures delays reaching low incidence numbers. The strategy to reduce daily new cases to a sufficiently low level to be controlled by contact tracing and testing turned out to work in Germany. This requires a responsible behaviour of the population, optimised contact tracing techniques and extended testing capacities in contact clusters.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sahamoddin Khailaie","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Mitra","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Arnab Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Marta Schips","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Pietro Mascheroni","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Binder","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Eili Y Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"For the CDC MInD-Healthcare Program","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053017","rel_title":"A mechanistic population balance model to evaluate the impact of interventions on infectious disease outbreaks: Case for COVID19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053017","rel_abs":"Infectious diseases can be devastating, especially when new and highly contagious, producing epidemic outbreaks that can become pandemics. Such is the case of COVID-19, the worst pandemic the world has seen in more than 100 years. Predicting the course and outcomes of such a pandemic in relation to possible interventions is crucial for societal and healthcare planning and forecasting of resource needs. In this work a deterministic model was developed, using elements from the SIR-type models, that describes individuals in a population in compartments by infection stage and age group. The model assumes a close well-mixed community with no migrations. Infection rates and clinical and epidemiological information govern the transitions between stages of the disease. The present model provides a platform to build upon and its current low complexity retains accessibility to both experts and non-experts as well as policy makers to comprehend the variables and phenomena at play. The impact of several possible interventions that have been or may be applied to slow the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak is evaluated. Key findings in our model simulation results indicate that (i) universal social isolation measures may be effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the average number of daily social interactions is reduced to very low numbers; (ii) selective isolation of only the age groups most vulnerable to the disease (i.e. older than 60) appears almost as effective in reducing total fatalities but at a much lower economic damage; (iii) the use of protective equipment (PPE) appears capable of very significantly reducing total fatalities if implemented extensively and to a high degree; (iv) extensive random testing of the population leading to infection recognition and subsequent immediate (self) isolation of the infected individuals, appears to be an ineffective intervention due to the required (unreachable with existing test sensitivities) high percentage of infection detections and the incapability to be sustained over time; (v) an increase in the number of critical care beds to directly save significant numbers of lives with a direct reduction in total final fatalities per each extra available critical care bed unit.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Paton","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Joao M Uratani","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Juan M Acuna","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Pietro Mascheroni","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Binder","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Michael Meyer-Hermann","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Eili Y Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"For the CDC MInD-Healthcare Program","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053579","rel_title":"Adaptive cyclic exit strategies from lockdown to suppress COVID-19 and allow economic activity","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053579","rel_abs":"Many countries have applied lockdown that helped suppress COVID-19, but with devastating economic consequences.

RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives can occur if the sample contains insufficient quantities of the virus to be successfully amplified and detected. The amount of virus in a swab is likely to vary between patients, sample location (nasal, throat or sputum) and through time as infection progresses. Here, we analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with throat samples less likely to yield a positive result relative to nasal samples. Empirically derived distributions of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation allowed us to comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages. We further estimate the expected numbers of false negative tests in a group of tested individuals and show how this is affected by the timing of the tests. Finally, we assessed the robustness of these estimates of false negative rates to the probability of false positive tests. This work has implications both for the identification of infected patients and for the discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Wikramaratna","author_inst":"None."},{"author_name":"Robert S Paton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mahan Ghafari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Boaz Dudovich","author_inst":"Applied Materials"},{"author_name":"Eran Yashiv","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Amos J.

We here investigated the geographical expansion of the infection and correlate it with the annual indexes of air quality observed from the Sentinel-5 satellite orbiting around China, Italy and the U.S.A. Controlling for population size, we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Higher mortality was also correlated with poor air quality, namely with high PM2.5, CO and NO2 values. In Italy, the correspondence between poor air quality and SARS-CoV-2 appearance and induced mortality was the starkest. Similar to smoking, people living in polluted areas are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality. This further suggests the detrimental impact climate change will have on the trajectory of future epidemics.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Riccardo Pansini","author_inst":"Yunnan University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Davide Fornacca","author_inst":"Institute of Eastern-Himalaya Biodiversity Research, Dali University, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Mahan Ghafari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Boaz Dudovich","author_inst":"Applied Materials"},{"author_name":"Eran Yashiv","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Amos J.

It has caused a global outbreak which represents a major threat to global health. Public health resorted to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdown to slow down the spread of the pandemic. However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we suggest that pre-symptomatic transmission could be a significant driver of the infection spread. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anass Bouchnita","author_inst":"Complex Systems and Interactions Team, Ecole Centrale Casablanca, Ville Verte, Bouskoura, Casablanca, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Aissam Jebrane","author_inst":"Complex Systems and Interactions Team, Ecole Centrale Casablanca, Ville Verte, Bouskoura, Casablanca, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Mahan Ghafari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Boaz Dudovich","author_inst":"Applied Materials"},{"author_name":"Eran Yashiv","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Amos J.

Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States. Design: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data. Data sources: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. Main outcome measures: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state issuance of the stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 g\/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%, 15%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Wu","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Rachel C.

The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID 19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID 19) infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus. By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility Exposure Infection Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India. Further, we have utilized the current surveillance data from Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Tamil Nadu to accurately predict the spreading trend of the infection on a state level.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arsath Abbasali Ayubali Sr.","author_inst":"College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai - 600 025, India"},{"author_name":"Sara Roshini Satheesh Jr.","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Social Anthropologist, Chennai - 600 008, India"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.

Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P<0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: < 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.
