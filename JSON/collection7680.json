Whether antibodies are important for the adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be determined. Here, 26 cases of COVID-19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms and no cases of severe symptoms were found among these patients. A striking feature of some patients is that SARS-CoV-2 could exist in patients who have virus-specific IgG antibodies for a very long period, with one case for up to 36 days. One COVID-19 patient who did not produce any SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 after 46 days of illness, revealing that without antibody-mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this report may provide a basis for further analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 clearance, especially in non-severe cases. This study also has implications for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bin Wang","author_inst":"Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China"},{"author_name":"Xianggen Kong","author_inst":"Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Geng","author_inst":"Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China"},{"author_name":"Di Xiao","author_inst":"Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China"},{"author_name":"Chunhong Ma","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Jiang","author_inst":"Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China"},{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20056523","rel_title":"The effect of Arbidol Hydrochloride on reducing mortality of Covid-19 patients: a retrospective study of real world date from three hospitals in Wuhan","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20056523","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic develops rapidly. There is a pressing need to find an effective therapy. METHODS We have assembled a cohort consisting 504 hospitalized COVID-19. Information of patients characteristics and antiviral medication use during hospital stay is collected. The study objective is to evaluate the treatment efficacy of selected antiviral medications on mortality and lesion absorption based on chest CT scan. RESULTS The overall mortality rate was 15.67% in the cohort. Older age, lower SpO2 level, bigger lesion, early admission data, and the presence of pre-existing conditions were associated with higher mortality. After adjusting for sex, pre-existing condition, age, SpO2, lesion size, admission data, hospital, and anti-viral medications use, Arbidol and Oseltamivir use is associated with a reduction in mortality. The OR is 0.183 (95% CI, 0.075 to 0.446; p<0.001) for Arbidol and 0.220 (95% CI, 0.069 to 0.707; p=0.011) for Oseltamivir. Compared with patients taking neither Arbidol nor Oseltamivir, the OR is 0.253 (95% CI, 0.064 to 1.001; p=0.050) for patients taking Oseltamivir only; 0.190 (95% CI, 0.076 to 0.473; p<0.001) for patients taking Arbidol only; and 0.030 (95% CI, 0.003 to 0.310; p=0.003) for patients taking both, after adjusting for patients characteristics and Lopinavir\/Ritonavir use. Similarly, Arbidol is also associated with faster lesion absorption after adjusting for patients characteristics as well as Oseltamivir and Lopinavir\/Ritonavir use. CONCLUSIONS Arbidol is able to substantially associated with a reduction in mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The combination of Arbidol and Oselmativir may further associated with a reduction in mortality. There is no proven treatment benefit of Lopinavir\/Ritonavir.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qibin Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuemin Fang","author_inst":"Graduate School of Health Innovation, Kanagawa University of Human Services"},{"author_name":"Lu Tian","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ungil Chung","author_inst":"Graduate School of Health Innovation, Kanagawa University of Human Services"},{"author_name":"Ke Wang","author_inst":"Departmentof Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,Tongji Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dan Li","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiyong Dai","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shen","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Yao","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20060467","rel_title":"Neutralising antibodies to SARS coronavirus 2 in Scottish blood donors - a pilot study of the value of serology to determine population exposure","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20060467","rel_abs":"Background. The progression and geographical distribution of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland between the 17th of March and the 18th of May to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression. Aim. To determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between the 17th of March and 19th of May, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Results. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 6\/500 donors from the 23th-26th of March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after the 5th-6th April until the end of the study on the 18th of May. We find that infections are concentrated in certain postcodes indicating that outbreaks of infection are extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remain comparatively untouched by the epidemic. Conclusion. These data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert Paton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jai S Bolton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bridget Penman","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Lian Ni Lee","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Valerie Odon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Senthil Chinnakannan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Edmans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20060566","rel_title":"Delayed clearance of SARS-CoV2 in male compared to female patients: High ACE2 expression in testes suggests possible existence of gender-specific viral reservoirs","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20060566","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 has been observed to cause a higher incidence and greater severity of disease in males, as seen in multiple cohorts across the globe. The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors. To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection, we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal\/nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT-PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai, India. A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years (3-75 range) were examined and included 48 (71%) males and 20 (29%) females. We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males, with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result (P value = 0.038). Furthermore, examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially, demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS-CoV2 infection earlier in each family. To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males, we examined the expression patterns of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in tissue specific repositories. We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV2. High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditi Shastri","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Justin Wheat","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Sachee Agrawal","author_inst":"Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital, Kasturba Hospital for Infections Diseases, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Nirjhar Chaterjee","author_inst":"Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital Kasturba Hospital for Infections Diseases, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Kith Pradhan","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Mendel Goldfinger","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Noah Kornblum","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Steidl","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Amit Verma","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"},{"author_name":"Jayanthi Shastri","author_inst":"Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital, Kasturba Hospital for Infections Diseases, Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Edmans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20060491","rel_title":"Monitoring and predicting viral dynamics in SARS-CoV-2-infected Patients","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20060491","rel_abs":"This manuscript is based on the a simple but robust model we developed urgently to accurately monitor and predict viral dynamics for each SARS-CoV-2-infected patient, given the limited number of RT-PCR tests and the complexity of each individual's physical health situation.

Methods: A retrospective review of all COVID-19 infected patients treated at Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 1 to Mar 20 was carried out. Continuous variables were described as mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR), while categorical variables were compared by X2 test or Fisher's exact test between COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG (-) and mycoplasma lgG (+). Results: Statistically significant differences were shown in terms of laboratory test results. COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG positivity had a higher lymphocyte count and percentage (p=0.026, p=0.017), monocyte count and percentage (p=0.028, p=0.006) and eosinophil count and percentage (p=0.039, p=0.007), and a lower neutrophil count and percentage (p=0.044, p=0.006) than COVID-19 infected patients without mycoplasma lgG. Other routine blood tests, including coagulation tests, blood biochemistry and infection-related biomarkers did not significantly differ except for thrombin time (p=0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.008). Furthermore, requirement and use of a nasal catheter or oxygen mask was significantly lower in COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG positivity (p=0.029).

Due to presumptions of poor outcomes in such critically ill patients, many hospitals have started considering a universal do-not-resuscitate order in patients with confirmed Covid-19 given a limited supply of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and the potential risk of transmission of infection to healthcare workers during resuscitation. However, empirical data on survival of cardiac arrest in Covid-19 patients are unavailable at this time. To inform this debate, we report survival outcomes following cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a cohort of similar critically ill patients with pneumonia or sepsis who were receiving mechanical ventilation in an ICU at the time of arrest. The probability of survival without severe neurological disability (CPC of 1 or 2) ranged from less than 3% to over 22% across key patient subgroups, For patients with an initial rhythm of asystole or PEA, who were also receiving vasopressors at the time of arrest, fewer than 10% were discharged without severe neurological disability (CPC of 1 or 2), and this number dropped to less than 3% in patients over 80 years old. In contrast, survival rates were much higher in younger patients, patients with an initial rhythm of VF or pulseless VT, and in patients receiving ventilatory support without vasopressors. Our findings suggest caution in universal resuscitation policies. Even in a cohort of critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation, survival outcomes following in-hospital resuscitation were not uniformly poor and varied markedly depending on age, co-morbidities and illness severity. We believe that these data can help inform discussions among patients, providers and hospital leaders regarding resuscitation policies and goals of care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saket Girotra","author_inst":"University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Tang","author_inst":"St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul Chan","author_inst":"University of Missouri - Kansas City and St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO"},{"author_name":"Brahmajee K Nallamothu","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"author_name":"Antonio Tufaro","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Angela Maria Vittoria Larocca","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Maria Chironna","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061366","rel_title":"A Fractal kinetics SI model can explain the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061366","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a shocking impact on the lives of everybody on the planet.

Particularly, strong correlations (R2>0.72) between the risk of COVID-19 fatality and NO2 and PM2.5 pollution concentrations were also found. Although this study assumed the same level of air pollution across a particular London borough, it demonstrates the possibility to employ air pollution as an indicator to rapidly identify the vulnerable regions within a city.

We examine the impact of these lockdowns on outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Using an agent-based model and simulations, we find that the risk and severity of such outbreaks is much greater under lockdown conditions, with the number of infected people doubling in some cases. This increase in number of cases varies by different mosquito-borne diseases, and is significantly higher for diseases spread by day-biting mosquitoes. We analysed various intervention strategies and found that during lockdowns, decentralised strategies such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are more effective than centralised strategies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshay Jindal","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Shrisha Rao","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology - Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Mehran Eskandari Torbaghan","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ajith Kumar Parlikad","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Antonio Tufaro","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Angela Maria Vittoria Larocca","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Maria Chironna","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20060228","rel_title":"Basic reproduction number of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease in Major Endemic Areas of China: A latent profile analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20060228","rel_abs":"Objective: The aim of the study is to analyze the latent class of basic reproduction number (R0) trend of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in major endemic areas of China. Methods The provinces that reported more than 500 cases of COVID-19 till February 18, 2020 were selected as the major endemic area. The Verhulst model was used to fit the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases. The R0 of COVID-19 was calculated using the parameters of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19, respectively. The latent class of R0 was analyzed using a latent profile analysis model. Results The median R0 calculated from SARS and COVID-19 parameters were 1.84 - 3.18 and 1.74 - 2.91, respectively. The R0 calculated from the SARS parameters was greater than that of calculated from the COVID-19 parameters (Z = -4.782 - -4.623, P < 0.01). Both R0 can be divided into three latent classes. The initial value of R0 in class 1 (Shandong Province, Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality) was relatively low and decreases slowly. The initial value of R0 in class 2 (Anhui Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province) was relatively high and decreases rapidly. Moreover, the initial value of R0 of class 3 (Hubei Province) was between that of class 1 and class 2, but the higher level of R0 lasts longer and decreases slowly. Conclusion The results indicated that overall trend of R0 has been falling with the strengthening of China's comprehensive prevention and control measures for COVID-19, however, presents regional differences.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Honglv Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Min Yuan","author_inst":"School of Health Service Management, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liya Ma","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meng Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Gan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fangbiao Tao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo D'Addabbo","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Donata Raffaele","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Cafagna","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20059253","rel_title":"Age could be driving variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20059253","rel_abs":"Background Current geographic spread of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections shows heterogeneity.

Methods An age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population [&ge;]1 million. Results Assuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R0 was 1.05 versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons) for the infections rate was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and\/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3 (versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9). Conclusions Age could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries with sizable adult and\/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Houssein H.

However, it is impaired by high costs, logistic issues and high risk of exposure. Chest x-ray (CXR) is a low-cost, low-risk, not time consuming technique and is emerging as the recommended imaging modality to use in COVID-19 pandemic. This technique, although less sensitive than CT-scan, can provide useful information about pulmonary involvement. Purpose To describe chest x-ray features of COVID-19 pneumonia and to evaluate the sensitivity of this technique in detecting pneumonia. A further scope is to assess the effectiveness of a post-processing algorithm in improving lung lesions detectability. Materials and Methods 72 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 underwent bedside chest X-ray. Two radiologists were asked to express their opinion about: (i) presence of pneumonia (negative or positive); (ii) localization (unilateral or bilateral); (iii) topography (according to pulmonary fields); (iv) density (non consolidative ground-glass or inhomogeneous opacities; consolidative nodulartype or triangular; mixed consolidative e non-consolidative); and (v) presence of pleural effusion. The point (i) was evaluated separately, while the other points in consensus. A quality assessment of post-processed x-ray images was performed by two different readers. Results The agreement about presence of pneumonia was almost perfect with K value of 0.933 and p < 0.001. Sensitivity was 69%. The following findings were seen: unilateral lung involvement in 50%; lower lung lesions in 54%; peripheral distribution in 48%; and non-consolidative pattern in 44%. Post-processed images improved the detection of lesions in 7 out 72 patients ({cong}10%) Conclusion CXR owns a good sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 lung involvement. Use of post-processing algorithm can improve detection of lesions. Our data support recommendations of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) to consider chest x-ray as first step imaging examination in Covid-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michele Gaeta","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Cicero","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Maria Adele Marino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Tommaso D'Angelo","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Enrico Maria Mormina","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062695","rel_title":"Shut it down: a cross country panel analysis on the efficacy of lockdown measures","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062695","rel_abs":"Coronavirus pandemic outbreak from China in the December 2019 and since then has quickly spread all over the world.

In this study, we provided information regarding both of these crucial factors. First, we investigated the importance of different measures such as quarantine, isolation, face mask, social distancing, etc. in controlling the virus in various countries.

To assess the impact of isolation measures on deaths, hospitalizations, and economic output, we create a mathematical model to simulate the spread of COVID-19, incorporating effects of restrictive measures and segmenting the population based on health risk and economic vulnerability. Policymakers make isolation policy decisions based on current levels of disease spread and economic damage. For 76 weeks in a population of 330 million, we simulate a baseline scenario leaving strong isolation restrictions in place, rapidly reducing isolation restrictions for non-seniors shortly after outbreak containment, and gradually relaxing isolation restrictions for non-seniors. We used 76 weeks as an approximation of the time at which a vaccine will be available. In the baseline scenario, there are 235,724 deaths and the economy shrinks by 34.0%. With a rapid relaxation, a second outbreak takes place, with 525,558 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 32.3%. With a gradual relaxation, there are 262,917 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 29.8%. We also show that hospitalizations, deaths, and economic output are quite sensitive to disease spread by asymptomatic people. Strict restrictions on seniors with very gradual lifting of isolation for non-seniors results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage. Therefore, we recommend this strategy and measures that reduce non-isolated disease spread to control the pandemic while making isolation economically viable.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uri Goldsztejn","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"David Schwartzman","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis."},{"author_name":"Arye Nehorai","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Tommaso D'Angelo","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Enrico Maria Mormina","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061804","rel_title":"Ivermectin as a potential COVID-19 treatment from the pharmacokinetic point of view","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061804","rel_abs":"The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent ivermectin has been very recently found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and proposed as a candidate for drug repurposing in COVID-19.

As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number over time during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods: We extracted the epidemic data from the \"Tracking the Epidemic\" website of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the duration of January 19, 2020 and March 14, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the time-varying reproduction number in the R software. Results: The epidemic curve of daily new confirmed cases in China peaked around February 4-6, 2020, and then declined gradually, except the very high peak on February 12, 2020 owing to the added clinically diagnosed cases of the Hubei Province. Under two specified plausible scenarios for the distribution of serial interval, both curves of the estimated time-varying reproduction numbers fell below 1.0 around February 17-18, 2020. Finally, the COVID-19 epidemic in China abated around March 7-8, 2020, indicating that the prompt and aggressive control measures of China were effective. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated time-varying reproduction number going downhill speedily was more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urged public health authorities and scientists to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers routinely during an epidemic of infectious diseases and to report them daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fu-Chang Hu","author_inst":"International-Harvard Statistical Consulting Company"},{"author_name":"Fang-Yu Wen","author_inst":"International-Harvard Statistical Consulting Company"},{"author_name":"Arye Nehorai","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Tommaso D'Angelo","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Enrico Maria Mormina","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062109","rel_title":"Lopinavir\/ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20062109","rel_abs":"Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir\/ritonavir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Design This is the protocol of a living systematic review. Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of lopinavir\/ritonavir - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating lopinavir\/ritonavir in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisca Verdugo-Paiva","author_inst":"Fundacion Epistemonikos"},{"author_name":"Ariel Izcovich","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Service, German Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Martin Ragusa","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Service, German Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Rada","author_inst":"Fundacion Epistemonikos"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 L-OVE Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Silvio Mazziotti","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Blandino","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Giulio Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Aurelio La Corte","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Massimo Chiappini","author_inst":"Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Finocchio","author_inst":"University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Vito Garrisi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II"},{"author_name":"Alexander Fyfe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Imlach","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Kreepa Kooblall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lim","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cesar Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol-Anne McInally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Narayan Ramamurthy","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piyada Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Beibei Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marc Turner","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Oliver Sampson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Calum Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jarvis","author_inst":"Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061473","rel_title":"An experimental trial of recombinant human interferon alpha nasal drops to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 in medical staff in an epidemic area","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061473","rel_abs":"Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon alpha (rhIFN-) nasal drops in healthy medical staff to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A prospective, open-label study was conducted in January 21, 2020at Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City, Hubei Province. Totally, 2944 medical staff members were recruited and allocated into low-risk group or high-risk group according to whether they were directly exposed to COVID-19 patients. Participants in the low-risk group received rhIFN- nasal drops (2-3 drops\/nostril\/time, 4 times\/day) for 28 days with first-level protection; those in the high-risk group received identical rhIFN- nasal drops combined with thymosin-1 (1.6 mg, hypodermic injection, once a week) along with secondary-level or third-level protection. The primary outcome was new-onset COVID-19 over 28 days. The secondary outcome was new-onset fever or respiratory symptoms but with negative pulmonary images. The results were compared with new-onset COVID-19 in medical staff in Hubei Province (including Wuhan) during the same period. Adverse reactions to interferon nasal drops were also observed. Results Among the 2944 subjects in our study, 2415 were included in the low-risk group, including 997 doctors and 1418 nurses with average ages of 37.38 and 33.56 years, respectively; 529 were included in the high-risk group, including 122 doctors and 407 nurses with average ages of 35.24 and 32.16 years, respectively. The 28-day incidence of COVID-19 was zero in both the high and low-risk groups. The 28-day incidence of new-onset clinical symptoms with negative images for pneumonia was also zero in both the high and low-risk groups. As control, a total of 2035 medical personnel with confirmed COVID-19 from the same area (Hubei Province) was observed between January 21 to February 23, 2020. No serious adverse events were observed in our trial during the intervention period. Conclusion In this investigator-initiated open-label study, we observed that rhIFN- nasal drops may effectively prevent COVID-19 in medical staff, as an enhancement protection on the basis of standard physical isolation. Our results also indicate that rhIFN- nasal drops have potential promise for protecting susceptible healthy people during the coronavirus pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhongji Meng","author_inst":"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Team, Taihe Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine.

While PCR-based assays are used for diagnosis, high through-put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion, potential plasma donors, and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen. Methods. A Luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from COVID-19-infected and -uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Findings. Fluorochrome-labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain or its central portion, the receptor binding domain (RBD). Coated beads were incubated with sera, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human total Ig antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin. Readout using a Luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subject, delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects. Interpretation. Antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have seroconverted, as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered. The use of the Luminex binding Ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours, uses very little antigen, and permits a high through-put of samples\/day. Funding.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show a wide range of symptoms and disease severity, while limited data is available on its immunogenicity. Here, the kinetics of the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in relation to clinical features and dynamics of specific B-cell populations are reported. Immunophenotyping of B cells was performed by flow cytometry with longitudinally collected PBMCs. In parallel, serum samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies using whole proteome peptide microarrays. Soon after disease onset in a mild case, we observed an increased frequency of plasmablasts concomitantly with a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response. In contrast, a case with more severe progression showed a delayed, but eventually very strong and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response. This case study shows that determining SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody epitopes can be valuable to monitor the specificity and magnitude of the early B-cell response, which could guide the development of vaccine candidates. Follow-up studies are required to evaluate whether the kinetics and strength of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response could be potential prognostic markers of viral control.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christine Dahlke","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Jasmin Heidepriem","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces"},{"author_name":"Robin Kobbe","author_inst":"University Medical Center Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Rene Santer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Till Koch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

Bottlenecks in availability of ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may contribute to mortality, implying ethically difficult rationing decisions. It is unclear if accelerated equipment production will meet demand, calling for fallback solutions for life support in worst-case scenarios. Methods: Veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange (VV-ECMO) can provide vital support in bilateral lung failure. VV-ECMO essentially comprises large flow venous accesses, membrane gas exchange, and a blood pump. As thousands of FDA and CE certified Impella blood pumps and consoles are distributed globally for cardiac support, we explored ad-hoc assembly of lean ECMO systems by embedding Impella pumps coaxially in tubes in combination with standard gas exchangers. Results: Ad-hoc integration of Impella blood pumps with gas exchange modules, standard cannulas for large bore venous access, regular ECMO tubing, Y-pieces and connectors led to lean ECMO systems with stable performance over several days. Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood\/minute is realistic. Benefit\/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient requires respiratory support but cannot be supported because of lack of ventilators or unavailability of a required ECMO system. Conclusion: Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs using Impella pumps is feasible and results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules. However, such off-label use of the devices calls for specific ethical and regulatory considerations prior to their use as last resort in patients for whom no other treatment modalities are available.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Hunziker","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Urs Zenklusen","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Robin Kobbe","author_inst":"University Medical Center Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Rene Santer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Till Koch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

METHODS Laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases reported through the beginning of April were extracted from the Italian Civil Protection database. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into three periods: before February 21, from February 22 to early March, after early March. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and developed a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. We explicitly took into account for unascertained cases (positive cases with no symptoms or mild symptoms that have not been accounted for in official statistics). RESULTS Currently, the number of positive active cases has increased to around 30,000 in the Lombardy region. Due to restriction measures, the effective reproduction number dropped from 3.33 (95% CI: 2.03-3.69) during the first period, to 2.36 (95% CI: 2.21-2.70) during the second period. In the third period, the effective reproduction number is estimated to have dropped to 1.49 (95% CI: 1.35-1.62). The model estimates a great proportion of unascertained cases, about 90% of infected people has not been accounted for in official statistics. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have slowed down the covid-19 outbreak in the Lombardy region. However, notwithstanding the long-lasting lockdown period, the epidemic is still not under control. The effective reproduction number, according to the model used in this work, is still greater than 1.0. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angelo Riccio","author_inst":"Universita' Parthenope di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Douglas D Miller","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Adam E Berman","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"David C Hess","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Steven G Krantz","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

A rapid increase in confirmed cases started in March, and the number of infected people is however unknown, largely due to the rather limited testing scale. A number of reports published so far reveal that the COVID-19 has long incubation period, high fatality ratio and non-specific symptoms, making this novel coronavirus far different from common seasonal influenza. In this note, we present a modified SEIR model which takes into account the time lag effect and probability distribution of model states. Based on the proposed model, it is estimated that the actual total number of infected people by 1 April in the UK might have already exceeded 610,000. Average fatality rates under different assumptions at the beginning of April 2020 are also estimated. Our model also reveals that the R0 value is between 7.5-9 which is much larger than most of the previously reported values. The proposed model has a potential to be used for assessing future epidemic situations under different intervention strategies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peiliang SUN","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Kang Li","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Adam E Berman","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"David C Hess","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Steven G Krantz","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

Few recent studies have suggested a positive protective correlation of the BCG vaccination policy of the countries with the observed COVID-19 severity. The current study was undertaken to reassess the existing data as of 4th April 2020. The incidence rates (cases per million population), Case Fatality Rates (CFR) and inherently more robust Infection Fatality Rates (IFR) were calculated across countries accounting for about 99% COVID-19 deaths. The initial scrutiny suggested a weaker association with BCG vaccination policy or BCG coverage, so positivity to the Tuberculin Sensitivity Test (TST)\/ Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) as a measure of the potential protective effect of the resident populations exposure to Mycobacterium spp. whether from BCG vaccination or as a result of exposure to environmental mycobacteria was analyzed. The incidence rates (the number of cases per million population) decreased with an increase in % LTBI (TST\/IGRA positivity) for the analyzed countries with R2 =0.6343, suggesting an exponentially negative covariation. However, the covariation of CFR estimates that ranged from 0.29% to 12.25 % (average 5.39%) among countries, was tenuous. Interim estimates of IFR (i-IFR), a more dependable measure for such studies, for the best and worst-case scenarios, i.e., i-IFR-l and i-IFR-h, predict on an average 20.57% to 30.15 % COVID-19 fatality rates globally, but individual country estimates display huge variation. Among countries accounting for 92.14% deaths (11 countries; top 20% countries included in current study) the estimate for lowest IFRs (i-IFR-l=4.16 (China) & i-IFR-h=4.61 (China)) and highest IFRs (i-IFR-l=96.39% (UK); & i-IFR-h=96.54% (UK)) displayed huge difference (average for the group: CFR=6.8 {+\/-} 3.6%; i-IFR-l=34.97 {+\/-} 30.55%; & i-IFR-h=44.20 {+\/-} 29.08%). Currently, the worst affected countries Italy (CFR=12.25%; i-IFR-l=42.63%; i-IFR-h=48.69%) and Spain (CFR=9.39%; i-IFR-l=26.85%; i-IFR-h=36.60%) would seemingly cope with COVID-19 better than UK, Netherlands and USA while the countries Germany (CFR=1.40%; i-IFR-l=4.93%; i-IFR-h=17.49%) and Switzerland (CFR=3.01%; i-IFR-l=10.87%; i-IFR-h=16.23%) along with China could fare the best. The rest of the 80% countries (accounting for 6.74% deaths), seemed to have reduced mortality (CFR=2.45 {+\/-} 2.01; i-IFR-l= 30.62 {+\/-} 28.24%; i-IFR-h=40.99 {+\/-} 30.47%) with associated high % LTBI (17.28 {+\/-} 8.87) than top 20% countries. The inherent issues in the data set (e.g., heterogeneity, non-random sampling, different criteria of sampling and reporting, access to health care, genetic composition, underlying co-morbidities, etc) need to be taken into account for making informed decisions.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samer Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Kang Li","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Adam E Berman","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"David C Hess","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Steven G Krantz","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

In order to prevent the epidemic, lockdown was required in many areas of China, which led to inconvenience of treatment for dialysis patients. To explore the psychological distress and the psychological demand induced by COVID-19 in the patients undergoing dialysis and compare the difference between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal (PD) patients during the lockdown period. Methods: Questionnaires were given to the dialysis patients in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to investigate the patients' trauma-related distress in response to COVID-19. Results: 232 eligible respondents were enrolled in this cross-section study, consisting of 156 PD patients and 76 HD patients. The median IES score for all the enrolled patients was 8.00 (2.00-19.00), which belonged to the subclinical dimension of post-traumatic stress symptoms. HD patients had a significant higher IES score than PD patients (11.50 vs 8.00) (p<0.05). HD patients already got more psychological support from the medical staff. There was no significant difference on further demand of psychological support between the two groups. In the multivariate regression analysis, we found that dialysis vintage, the impact of COVID-19 on the severity of illness and daily life, and confidence in overcoming the disease contributed to IES score (p<0.05). Conclusions: HD patients had more severe trauma-related stress symptoms than PD patients. When major public healthy events occurred, careful psychological estimate and sufficient psychological support should be provided to the dialysis patients, especially to the HD patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zi Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxiao Xia","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofang Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xueli Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyun Zang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Li Pu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"My L.
