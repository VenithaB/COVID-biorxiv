However, the prevalence and the type of ocular symptoms varies substantially, and most studies report retrospective data from patients suffering from more serious versions of the disease. Little is known of exactly which ocular symptoms manifest in people with milder forms of COVID-19. Methods: An online questionnaire obtained self-report data from people in the community, who reported to be inflicted with COVID-19. The type and frequency of different symptoms suffered during COVID-19 were obtained. Details of any pre-existing ocular conditions and the duration of symptoms of COVID-19 were ascertained. Results: Data from 132 participants showed that the four most reported COVID-19 symptoms were Dry Cough (63%), Fever (67%), Fatigue (83%), and loss of Smell\/Taste (63%). 56% of the participants reported to having experienced an eye symptom, 46% reported to having a new or different eye symptom compared to pre-COVID-19 state. Three ocular symptoms (watery eyes, sore eyes, sensitivity to light) were significantly different from Pre-COVID-19 state (p<0.05). Logistic regression showed a significant association of eye symptoms with Fever (p=0.035). Conclusion: Nearly half of the sample of people studied experienced ocular symptoms. The significant ocular symptoms, indicative of viral conjunctivitis, might have been missed in patients with more serious manifestations of the disease. It is also important to differentiate between the types of ocular manifestation, as symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis (i.e. mucous discharge, gritty eyes) were not significant. Possible mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 infection within the eye are discussed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shahina Pardhan","author_inst":"Anglia Ruskin University"},{"author_name":"Megan Vaughan","author_inst":"Anglia Ruskin University"},{"author_name":"Jufen Zhang","author_inst":"Anglia Ruskin University"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"Anglia Ruskin University"},{"author_name":"Havovi Chichger","author_inst":"Anglia Ruskin University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"ophthalmology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20135152","rel_title":"Polymorphisms in the ACE2 Locus Associate with Severity of COVID-19 Infection","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20135152","rel_abs":"The mechanisms underlying risk of developing severe outcomes due to COVID-19 have not yet been fully elucidated. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a marked affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The ACE2 locus is highly polymorphic, and this genetic variability may affect COVID-19 disease severity. Here, we analyzed associations between polymorphisms in the ACE2 locus and COVID-19 severity in 62 patients found to be COVID-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction. Of these patients, 23 required hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Of 61 ACE2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in this patient cohort, 10 were significantly associated with tissue expression of ACE2. Logistic regression adjusted for age and sex identified six of these ten SNPs to be significantly associated with hospitalization. These results provide preliminary evidence of a link between the ACE2 genotype and COVID-19 disease severity and suggest that the ACE2 genotype may inform COVID-19 risk stratification and need for more intense therapy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke Wooster","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Nicholson","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Haakon H Sigurslid","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christian L Lino Cardenas","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Malhotra","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20135145","rel_title":"Social response to early-stage government control measures of COVID-19 in Colombia: population survey, April 8-20 2020.","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20135145","rel_abs":"On Monday, March 16, 2020, the government of Colombia announced actions to control COVID-19. These recommendations directly affected the entire population and included: reducing physical contact; reducing mobility and cancelling unnecessary travel; working from home; cancelling mass events; a 14 day at-home isolation period for people who arrived from international trips, or in cases in which someone in the household experienced a high temperature and sustained coughing; as well as increasing the frequency of hand washing and the use of face masks on public transport. In order to understand the public sentiment around these recommendations, Asociacion Profamilia developed an online survey through SurveyMonkey. The survey was completed by 3549 adult people in Colombia (+18 years) between April 8 and April 20, 2020. The survey in Colombia has four components: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) responsibility for care and employment, 3) perceptions on risk and health, and 4) behaviour changes and ability to isolate. The considered socio-demographic characteristics were age, gender, residential area, vulnerable groups, education level, ethnicity, marital status, city of residence, home ownership and type of health insurance.

While many people recover from the virus uneventfully, a subset of patients will require hospital admission, some with intensive care needs including intubation, and mechanical ventilation. To date there is no cure and no vaccine is available. Passive immunotherapy by the transfusion of convalescent plasma donated by COVID-19 recovered patients might be an effective option to combat the virus, especially if used early in the course of disease. Here we report our experience of using convalescent plasma at a tertiary care center in a mid-size, midwestern city that did not experience an overwhelming patient surge. Methods Hospitalized COVID-19 patients categorized as having Severe or Life-Threatening disease according to the Mayo Clinic Emergency Access Protocol were screened, consented, and treated with convalescent plasma collected from local donors recovered from COVID-19 infection. Clinical data and outcomes were collected retrospectively. Results 31 patients were treated, 16 severe patients and 15 life-threatened patients. Overall mortality was 27% (4\/31) but only patients with life-threatening disease died. 94% of transfused patients with severe disease avoided escalation to ICU care and mechanical ventilation. 67% of patients with life-threatening disease were able to be extubated. Most transfused patients had a rapid decrease in their respiratory support requirements on or about day 7 following convalescent plasma transfusion. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that convalescent plasma is associated with reducing ventilatory requirements in patients with both severe and life-threatening disease, but appears to be most beneficial when administered early in the course of disease when patients meet the criteria for severe illness.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Hartman","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Aaron S Hess","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Joseph P Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Mariana Calderon","author_inst":"Asociacion Profamilia Colombia"},{"author_name":"Marcela Sanchez","author_inst":"Asociacion Profamilia Colombia"},{"author_name":"Lina Castano","author_inst":"Asociacion Profamilia Colombia"},{"author_name":"Marta Royo","author_inst":"Asociacion Profamilia Colombia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.20.20136259","rel_title":"Spring Weather and COVID-19 Deaths in the U.S.","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.20.20136259","rel_abs":"This study used statistically robust regression models to control for a large set of confounders (including county-level time-invariant factors and time trends, regional-level daily variation, state-level social distancing measures, ultraviolet light, and levels of ozone and fine particulate matter, PM2.5) to estimate a reliable rather than simple regression for the impact of weather on the most accurately measured outcome of COVID-19, death. When the average minimum temperature within a five-day window increased by one degree Fahrenheit in spring 2020, daily death rates in northern U.S. counties increased by an estimated 5.1%. When ozone concentration over a five-day window rose by one part per billion, daily death rates in southern U.S. counties declined by approximately 2.0%. Maximum temperature, precipitation, PM2.5, and ultraviolet light did not significantly associate with COVID-19 mortality. The mechanism that may drive the observed association of minimum temperature on COVID-19 deaths in spring months may be increased mobility and contacts. The effect of ozone may be related to its disinfectant properties, but this requires further confirmation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SEYED M KARIMI","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Majbouri","author_inst":"Babson College"},{"author_name":"Kelsey White","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Bert Little","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"W.

Photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms by light energy emitted in the visible spectrum region (VIS), not harmful for mammalian cells and safe for humans, has recently been described. A LED-device emitting a special combination of frequencies in the visible light spectrum was tested on SARS-CoV-2 infected cell surnatant dilutions in order to evaluate the antiviral efficacy. This preliminary in vitro study showed for the first time the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 through LED irradiation of visible spectrum wavelengths.

Adverse events were mild, except for one case of Grade 2 ALT elevation. Adverse events were more commonly observed in the chloroquine group (44.44%) and the hydroxychloroquine group (50.00%) than in the control group (16.67%). The chloroquine group achieved shorter time to clinical recovery (TTCR) than the control group (P=0.019). There was a trend toward reduced TTCR in the hydroxychloroquine group (P=0.049).

Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell. These results suggest that myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, and breast are unlikely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV2. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is unlikely to contribute to pregnancy-related adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk, oogenesis and female fertility.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jyoti Goad","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Joshua Rudolph","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Aleksandar Rajkovic","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Marion Mafham","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Bell","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Louise Linsell","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Natalie Staplin","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Christopher Brightling","author_inst":"Institute for Lung Health, Leicester NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ustianowski","author_inst":"Regional Infectious Diseases Unit, North Manchester General Hospital & University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Einas Elmahi","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, Northampton General Hospital, Northampton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Prudon","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, North Tees & Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Christopher Green","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Microbiology & Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Timothy Felton","author_inst":"University of Manchester and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"David Chadwick","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Infection, James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Kanchan Rege","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Christopher Fegan","author_inst":"Department of Research and Development, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, Cardiff, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Chappell","author_inst":"School of Life Course Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Saul N Faust","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility and Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and University of Southampton, "},{"author_name":"Thomas Jaki","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom and MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alan Montgomery","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Rowan","author_inst":"Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Edmund Juszczak","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Richard Haynes","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- RECOVERY Collaborative Group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.164384","rel_title":"Functional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests a complex inflammatory response and metabolic alterations","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.164384","rel_abs":"Covid-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has reached the category of a worldwide pandemic. Even though intensive efforts, no effective treatments or a vaccine are available. Molecular characterization of the transcriptional response in Covid-19 patients could be helpful to identify therapeutic targets. In this study, RNAseq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from Covid-19 patients and healthy controls was analyzed from a functional point of view using probabilistic graphical models. Two networks were built: one based on genes differentially expressed between healthy and infected individuals and another one based on the 2,000 most variable genes in terms of expression in order to make a functional characterization. In the network based on differentially expressed genes, two inflammatory response nodes with different tendencies were identified, one related to cytokines and chemokines, and another one related to bacterial infections. In addition, differences in metabolism, which were studied in depth using Flux Balance Analysis, were identified. SARS-CoV2-infection caused alterations in glutamate, methionine and cysteine, and tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism. In the network based on 2,000 most variable genes, also two inflammatory nodes with different tendencies between healthy individuals and patients were identified. Similar to the other network, one was related to cytokines and chemokines. However, the other one, lower in Covid-19 patients, was related to allergic processes and self-regulation of the immune response. Also, we identified a decrease in T cell node activity and an increase in cell division node activity. In the current absence of treatments for these patients, functional characterization of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection could be helpful to define targetable processes. Therefore, these results may be relevant to propose new treatments.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Trilla-Fuertes","author_inst":"Biomedica Molecular Medicine SL."},{"author_name":"Ricardo Ramos-Ruiz","author_inst":"Parque Cientifico de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Natalia Blanca-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Leonor"},{"author_name":"Elena Lopez-Camacho","author_inst":"Biomedica Molecular Medicine SL"},{"author_name":"Laura Martin-Pedraza","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Leonor"},{"author_name":"Pablo Ryan Murua","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Leonor"},{"author_name":"Mariana Diaz-Almiron","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz"},{"author_name":"Carlos Llorens","author_inst":"Biotechvana, Parc Cientific, Universitat de Valencia"},{"author_name":"Toni Gabaldon","author_inst":"BSC-IRB"},{"author_name":"Andres Moya","author_inst":"Universitat de Valencia"},{"author_name":"Juan Angel Fresno","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz"},{"author_name":"Angelo Gamez-Pozo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitaio La Paz"},{"author_name":"Timothy Felton","author_inst":"University of Manchester and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"David Chadwick","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Infection, James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Kanchan Rege","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Christopher Fegan","author_inst":"Department of Research and Development, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, Cardiff, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Chappell","author_inst":"School of Life Course Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Saul N Faust","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility and Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and University of Southampton, "},{"author_name":"Thomas Jaki","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom and MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alan Montgomery","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Rowan","author_inst":"Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Edmund Juszczak","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Richard Haynes","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- RECOVERY Collaborative Group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.163550","rel_title":"Mathematical modeling explains differential SARS CoV-2 kinetics in lung and nasal passages in remdesivir treated rhesus macaques","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.163550","rel_abs":"Remdesivir was recently demonstrated to decrease recovery time in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We developed mathematical models to explain these results. We identified that 1) drug potency is slightly higher in nasal passages than in lungs, 2) viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung, 3) incomplete drug potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage, and 4) increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response, as well as a lack of refractory cells. We also hypothesize that direct inoculation of the trachea in rhesus macaques may not recapitulate natural infection as lung damage occurs more abruptly in this model than in human infection. We demonstrate with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe developed a mathematical model to explain why remdesivir has a greater antiviral effect on SARS CoV-2 in lung versus nasal passages in rhesus macaques.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Goyal","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth R Duke","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Erwing Fabian Cardozo-Ojeda","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Schiffer","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Laura Martin-Pedraza","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Leonor"},{"author_name":"Pablo Ryan Murua","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Leonor"},{"author_name":"Mariana Diaz-Almiron","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz"},{"author_name":"Carlos Llorens","author_inst":"Biotechvana, Parc Cientific, Universitat de Valencia"},{"author_name":"Toni Gabaldon","author_inst":"BSC-IRB"},{"author_name":"Andres Moya","author_inst":"Universitat de Valencia"},{"author_name":"Juan Angel Fresno","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz"},{"author_name":"Angelo Gamez-Pozo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitaio La Paz"},{"author_name":"Timothy Felton","author_inst":"University of Manchester and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"David Chadwick","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Infection, James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Kanchan Rege","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Christopher Fegan","author_inst":"Department of Research and Development, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, Cardiff, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Chappell","author_inst":"School of Life Course Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Saul N Faust","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility and Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and University of Southampton, "},{"author_name":"Thomas Jaki","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom and MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alan Montgomery","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Rowan","author_inst":"Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Edmund Juszczak","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Richard Haynes","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- RECOVERY Collaborative Group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.163394","rel_title":"Endemic human coronaviruses induce distinct antibody repertoires in adults and children","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.163394","rel_abs":"Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with acute respiratory infection in humans.

Seroprevalence of antibodies to endemic HCoVs ranged between ~4 and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2 cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody responses in adult donors. Our findings shed light on the dominant species-specific and pan-CoV target sites of human antibody responses to coronavirus infection, thereby providing important insights for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taushif Khan","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mahbuba Rahman","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fatima Al Ali","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Susie SY Huang","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manar Ata","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Paul Bastard","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Liu","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Jouanguy","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Vivien Beziat","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Cobat","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Gheyath K Nasrallah","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hadi Yassine","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Maria Smatti","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Amira Sayeed","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Vandernoot","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Smits","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Migeotte","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Filomeen Haerynck","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Meyts","author_inst":"University Hospitals Leuven"},{"author_name":"Laurent Abel","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Jean-Laurent Casanova","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad R Hasan","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nico Marr","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- RECOVERY Collaborative Group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.164442","rel_title":"Pathogenicity, tissue tropism and potential vertical transmission of SARSr-CoV-2 in Malayan pangolins","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.164442","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is having severe impact on public health at a global scale.

While adaptive immune responses versus SARS-CoV-2 can be of critical importance to both recovery and vaccine efficacy, how protein antigens from this pathogen are processed to generate antigenic peptides is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the proteolytic processing of overlapping precursor peptides spanning the entire sequence of the S1 spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, by three key enzymes that generate antigenic peptides, aminopeptidases ERAP1, ERAP2 and IRAP. All enzymes generated shorter peptides with sequences suitable for binding onto HLA alleles, but with distinct specificity fingerprints. ERAP1 was the most efficient in generating peptides 8-11 residues long, the optimal length for HLA binding, while IRAP was the least efficient. The combination of ERAP1 with ERAP2 greatly limited the variability of peptide sequences produced. Less than 7% of computationally predicted epitopes were found to be produced experimentally, suggesting that aminopeptidase processing may constitute a significant filter to epitope presentation. These experimentally generated putative epitopes could be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity studies and vaccine design. We furthermore propose that this in vitro trimming approach could constitute a general filtering method to enhance the prediction robustness for viral antigenic epitopes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George Stamatakis","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Center Alexander Fleming"},{"author_name":"Martina Samiotaki","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Center Alexander Fleming"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Mpakali","author_inst":"National Centre for Scientific Research Demokritos"},{"author_name":"George Panayotou","author_inst":"Biomedical Sciences Research Center Alexander Fleming"},{"author_name":"Efstratios Stratikos","author_inst":"National Centre for Scientific Research Demokritos"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Paul Bastard","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Liu","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Jouanguy","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Vivien Beziat","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Cobat","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Gheyath K Nasrallah","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hadi Yassine","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Maria Smatti","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Amira Sayeed","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Vandernoot","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Smits","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Migeotte","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Filomeen Haerynck","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Meyts","author_inst":"University Hospitals Leuven"},{"author_name":"Laurent Abel","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Jean-Laurent Casanova","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad R Hasan","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nico Marr","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- RECOVERY Collaborative Group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.164665","rel_title":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as ACE2 blockers to inhibit viropexis of COVID-19 Spike psedotype virus","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.164665","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV) has been affecting global health since the end of 2019 and there is no sign that the epidemic is abating.

Several key studies have elucidated functions of few other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in miRNAs biogenesis, making it necessary to look miRNA biogenesis models with fresh approach.\n\nResultsA comprehensive study of >25TB of high-throughput data revealed that various combinations of RBPs and their networks determine the miRNA pool, regardless of DROSHA\/DICER. The discovered RBP and miRNA associations displayed strong functional alliances. An RBP, AAR2, was found highly associated with miRNAs biogenesis, which was experimentally validated. The RBPs combinations and networks were tested successfully across a large number of experimentally validated data and cell lines for the observed associations. The RBP networks were finally modeled into a XGBoosting-regression based tool to identify miRNA profiles without any need of doing miRNA-seq, which scored a reliable average accuracy of 91% on test sets. It was further tested across >400 independent experimental samples and scored consistently high accuracy. This tool was applied to reveal the miRNAome of Covid19 patients about which almost negligible information exists. A significant number of Covid19 specific miRNA targets were involved in IFN-gamma, Insulin\/IGF\/P3K\/AKT, and Ub-proteasome systems, found in cross-talk with each other and down-regulated heavily, holding promise as strong candidates for therapeutic solution.

Modeling them successfully can reveal miRNAomes with deep reaching impact.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Upendra Kumar Pradhan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur-176061 (Himachal Pradesh), India"},{"author_name":"Prince Anand","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur-176061 (Himachal Pradesh), India"},{"author_name":"Nitesh Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur-176061 (Himachal Pradesh), India"},{"author_name":"Prakash Kumar","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur-176061 (Himachal Pradesh), India"},{"author_name":"Ashwani Kumar","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur-176061 (Himachal Pradesh), India"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Pandey","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, Delhi, 110007, India"},{"author_name":"Yogendra Padwad","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur-176061 (Himachal Pradesh), India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Shankar","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur-176061 (Himachal Pradesh), India"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Jouanguy","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Vivien Beziat","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Cobat","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Gheyath K Nasrallah","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hadi Yassine","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Maria Smatti","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Amira Sayeed","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Vandernoot","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Goffard","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Smits","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Migeotte","author_inst":"Hopital Erasme"},{"author_name":"Filomeen Haerynck","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Meyts","author_inst":"University Hospitals Leuven"},{"author_name":"Laurent Abel","author_inst":"INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Jean-Laurent Casanova","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad R Hasan","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nico Marr","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"- RECOVERY Collaborative Group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.165225","rel_title":"In vivo antiviral host response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age","rel_date":"2020-06-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.165225","rel_abs":"Despite limited genomic diversity, SARS-CoV-2 has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA-sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and Th1 chemokines CXCL9\/10\/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9\/10\/11 and their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and\/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of NF-{kappa}B signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicole A.P.

We sought to develop an automatable score to predict hospitalization, critical illness, or death in patients at risk for COVID-19 presenting for urgent care during the Massachusetts outbreak. Methods. Single-center study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness clinics (RICs) or the emergency department (ED), including development (n = 9381, March 7-May 2) and prospective (n = 2205, May 3-14) cohorts. Data was queried from Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse. Outcomes were hospitalization, critical illness or death within 7 days. We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) using automatically extracted data from the electronic medical record and learning-to-rank ordinal logistic regression modeling. Calibration was assessed using predicted-to-observed event ratio (E\/O). Discrimination was assessed by C-statistics (AUC). Results. In the development cohort, 27.3%, 7.2%, and 1.1% of patients experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death, respectively; and in the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5%. CoVA showed excellent performance in the development cohort (concurrent validation) for hospitalization (E\/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.80); for critical illness (E\/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.82); and for death (E\/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.87). Performance in the prospective cohort (prospective validation) was similar for hospitalization (E\/O: 1.01, AUC: 0.76); for critical illness (E\/O 1.03, AUC: 0.79); and for death (E\/O: 1.63, AUC=0.93). Among 30 predictors, the top five were age, diastolic blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, COVID-19 testing status, and respiratory rate. Conclusions. CoVA is a prospectively validated automatable score to assessing risk for adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 infection in the outpatient setting.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haoqi Sun","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aayushee Jain","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael J Leone","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haitham S Alabsi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laura N Brenner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elissa Ye","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wendong Ge","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ping Shao","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christine L Boutros","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruopeng Wang","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ryan A Tesh","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Colin Magdamo","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah I Collens","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Ganglberger","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ingrid V Bassett","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"James B Meigs","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline T Chu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Dougan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Stratton","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Rosand","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bruce Fischl","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sudeshna Das","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shibani S Mukerji","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gregory K Robbins","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

Here, we studied the whole-blood transcriptomic host response to SARS-CoV-2 and compared it with other viral infections to understand similarities and differences in host response. Using RNAseq we profiled peripheral blood from 24 healthy controls and 62 prospectively enrolled patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection by SARS-Cov-2 within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. We also compiled and curated 23 independent studies that profiled 1,855 blood samples from patients with one of six viruses (influenza, RSV, HRV, ebola, Dengue, and SARS-CoV-1). We show gene expression changes in peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 versus healthy controls are highly correlated with changes in response to other viral infections (r=0.74, p<0.001). However, two genes, ACO1 and ATL3, show significantly opposite changes between conditions. Pathway analysis in patients with COVID-19 or other viral infections versus healthy controls identified similar pathways including neutrophil activation, innate immune response, immune response to viral infection, and cytokine production for over-expressed genes. Conversely, for under-expressed genes, pathways indicated repression of lymphocyte differentiation and T cell activation. When comparing transcriptome profiles of patients with COVID-19 directly with those with other viral infections, we found 114 and 302 genes were over- or under-expressed, respectively, during COVID-19. Pathways analysis did not identify any significant pathways in these genes, suggesting novel responses to further study. Statistical deconvolution using immunoStates found that M1 macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T cells, and total B cells showed change consistently in the same direction across all viral infections including COVID-19. Those that increased in COVID-19 but decreased in non-COVID-19 viral infections were CD56bright NK cells, M2 macrophages, and total NK cells. The concordant and discordant responses mapped out here provide a window to explore the pathophysiology of COVID-19 versus other viral infections and show clear differences in signaling pathways and cellularity as part of the host response to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simone A Thair","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Yudong D He","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Yehudit Hasin-Brumshtein","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Suraj Sakaram","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Rushika Pandya","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiaying Toh","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, School of Medicine and Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Department of Medicine, Stanford Unive"},{"author_name":"David Rawling","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Melissa Remmel","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Coyle","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc. 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"George N Dalekos","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa General Hospital, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Koutsodimitropoulos","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Latseion General Hospital of Elefsis, Greece"},{"author_name":"Glykeria Vlachogianni","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Aghios Dimitrios Thessaloniki General Hospital, Greece"},{"author_name":"Eleni Gkeka","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, AHEPA Thessaloniki General Hospital, Greece"},{"author_name":"Eleni Karakike","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, 124 62 Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Georgia Damoraki","author_inst":"8.\t4th Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, 124 62 Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Antonakos","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, 124 62 Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Purvesh Khatri","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, School of Medicine and Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Department of Medicine, Stanford Unive"},{"author_name":"Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, 124 62 Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Timothy E Sweeney","author_inst":"Inflammatix, Inc., 863 Mitten Rd, Suite 104, Burlingame, CA, 94010, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Dougan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Stratton","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Rosand","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bruce Fischl","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sudeshna Das","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shibani S Mukerji","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gregory K Robbins","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make methodological recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori et al. (2013), which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis (2004), are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for some retrospective analyses. We advise against using methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katelyn M Gostic","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Lauren McGough","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Edward Baskerville","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene a and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Keya Joshi","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Infection of African green monkeys (AGM) with a low passage human isolate of SARS-CoV-2 by aerosol or mucosal exposure resulted in mild clinical infection with a transient decrease in lung tidal volume. Imaging with human clinical-grade 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) co-registered with computed tomography (CT) revealed pulmonary lesions at 4 days post-infection (dpi) that resolved over time. Infectious virus was shed from both respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts in all animals in a biphasic manner, first between 2-7 dpi followed by a recrudescence at 14-21 dpi. Viral RNA (vRNA) was found throughout both respiratory and gastrointestinal systems at necropsy with higher levels of vRNA found within the GI tract tissues. All animals seroconverted simultaneously for IgM and IgG, which has also been documented in human COVID-19 cases. Young AGM represent an excellent species to study mild\/subclinical COVID-19 disease and have shed light on unknown aspects of long-term virus shedding.

Understanding and monitoring the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographical characteristics, and its stability are particularly important for controlling the spread of the disease and especially for the development of a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains. From this perspective, we analyzed 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 79 countries located in the six continents and collected from December 24, 2019, to May 13, 2020, according to the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the presence of 3,206 variant sites, with a uniform distribution of mutation types in different geographic areas. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations has been observed; only 169 mutations (5.27%) had a prevalence greater than 1% of genomes. Nevertheless, fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (> 10%) have been identified at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein and one in each of three proteins: spike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the RBD of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor. These results along with mutational frequency dissimilarity and intra-genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is not yet adapted to its host. Unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 makes the development of an effective global vaccine very likely.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarek Alouane","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Meriem Laamarti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Abdelomunim Essabbar","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Mohammed Hakmi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"El Mehdi Bouricha","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"M.W.

We describe here the singular metabolic background that creates a bottleneck constraining coronaviruses to evolve towards likely attenuation in the long term. Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the biosynthetic processes that allow the virus to multiply. This is because CTP is in demand for three essential steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope and, finally, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis. The CCA 3-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate (UTP) that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. We also highlight and provide a raison detre to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3-deoxy-3',4-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Christos Ouzounis","author_inst":"Biological Computation and Process Laboratory, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Chemical Process and Energy Resources Institute, Thessalonica 57001, G"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Wanying Sun","author_inst":"BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Philippe Marliere","author_inst":"TESSSI, The European Syndicate of Synthetic Scientists and Industrialists, 81 rue Reaumur, 75002, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Antoine Danchin","author_inst":"Kodikos Labs, Institut Cochin, 24, rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques Paris 75014, France"},{"author_name":"Houda Bendani","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rokia Laamarti","author_inst":"MASCIR, Rabat Design, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Fatima Ghrifi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Loubna Allam","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Tarik Aanniz","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Mouna Ouadghiri","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Naima El Hafidi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rachid El Jaoudi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Houda Benrahma","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Jalil El Attar","author_inst":"Laboratoire Riad, hay Riad, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rachid Mentag","author_inst":"Biotechnology Unit, Regional Center of Agricultural Research of Rabat, National Institute of Agricultural Research, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Laila Sbabou","author_inst":"Microbiology and Molecular Biology Team, Center of Plant and Microbial Biotechnology, Biodiversity and Environment, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University o"},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Sarah Cobey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Gregory K Robbins","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

IL-6 has been implicated as a cytokine negatively associated with survival after filovirus and coronavirus infection. However, IL-6 has also been shown to be an important mediator of innate immunity and important for the host response to an acute viral infection. Clinical studies are now being conducted by various researchers to evaluate the possible role of IL-6 blockers to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with CRS. Most of these studies involve the use of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (-IL-6R mAbs). We present data showing that direct neutralization of IL-6 with an -IL-6 mAb in a BALB\/c Ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge model produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with controls when administered within the first 24 hours of challenge and repeated every 72 hours. A similar effect was seen in mice treated with the same dose of -IL-6R mAb when the treatment was delayed 48 hrs post-challenge. These data suggest that direct neutralization of IL-6, early during the course of infection, may provide additional clinical benefits to IL-6 receptor blockade alone during treatment of patients with virus-induced CRS.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reid Martin Rubsamen","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Burkholz","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shane Massey","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Trevor Brasel","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Tom Hodge","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Herst","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Richard Thomas Carback III","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Paul Harris","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rokia Laamarti","author_inst":"MASCIR, Rabat Design, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Fatima Ghrifi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Loubna Allam","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Tarik Aanniz","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Mouna Ouadghiri","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Naima El Hafidi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rachid El Jaoudi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Houda Benrahma","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Jalil El Attar","author_inst":"Laboratoire Riad, hay Riad, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rachid Mentag","author_inst":"Biotechnology Unit, Regional Center of Agricultural Research of Rabat, National Institute of Agricultural Research, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Laila Sbabou","author_inst":"Microbiology and Molecular Biology Team, Center of Plant and Microbial Biotechnology, Biodiversity and Environment, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University o"},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Sarah Cobey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Gregory K Robbins","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

Despite its evolutionary youth, the enzyme is highly optimized to have good fidelity in nucleotide incorporation and a good catalytic efficiency. Our simulations strongly suggest that Remdesivir triphosphate (the active form of drug) is incorporated into the nascent RNA replacing ATP, leading to a duplex RNA which is structurally very similar to an unmodified one. We did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of Remdesivir at the active site. Displacement of the nascent Remdesivir-containing RNA duplex along the exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify delayed inhibition. However, after the incorporation of three more nucleotides we found a hydrated Serine which is placed in a perfect arrangement to react through a Pinners reaction with the nitrile group of Remdesivir. Kinetic barriers for crosslinking and polymerization are similar suggesting a competition between polymerization and inhibition. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape and structural analysis of polymerases across different species support the proposed mechanism and suggest that virus has not explored yet resistance to Remdesivir inhibition.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Aranda","author_inst":"IRB Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Modesto Orozco","author_inst":"IRB Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Shane Massey","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Trevor Brasel","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Tom Hodge","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Herst","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc."},{"author_name":"Richard Thomas Carback III","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Paul Harris","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rokia Laamarti","author_inst":"MASCIR, Rabat Design, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Fatima Ghrifi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Loubna Allam","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Tarik Aanniz","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Mouna Ouadghiri","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Naima El Hafidi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rachid El Jaoudi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Houda Benrahma","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Jalil El Attar","author_inst":"Laboratoire Riad, hay Riad, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rachid Mentag","author_inst":"Biotechnology Unit, Regional Center of Agricultural Research of Rabat, National Institute of Agricultural Research, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Laila Sbabou","author_inst":"Microbiology and Molecular Biology Team, Center of Plant and Microbial Biotechnology, Biodiversity and Environment, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University o"},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Sarah Cobey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Gregory K Robbins","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.
