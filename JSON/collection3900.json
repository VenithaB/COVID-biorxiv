We compared COVID-19 mortality at different altitudes. Methods: Retrospective analysis of population-level data on COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. (1,016 counties) and Mexico (567 municipalities). Mixed-model Poisson regression analysis of the association between altitude and COVID-19 mortality using individual-level data from 40,168 Mexican subjects with COVID-19, adjusting for multiple covariates. Results: Between January 20 and April 13, 2020, mortality rates were higher in U.S. counties located at [&ge;]2,000 m elevation vs. those located below 1,500 m (12.3 vs. 3.2 per 100,000; P<0.001). In Mexico, between March 13 and May 13, 2020, mortality rates were higher in municipalities located at [&ge;]2,000 m vs. <1,500 m (5.3 vs. 3.9 per 100,000; P<0.001). Among Mexican subjects <65 years old, the risk of death was 36% higher in those living at [&ge;]2,000 m vs. <1,500 m (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.78; P=0.022).

The aim was to explore experiences, information and support needs, and decision-making of parents with a child with cancer in response to the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Methods Parents of a child with cancer completed a survey in April 2020, as the UK moved into a period of \"lockdown\", with restrictions of movement outside of the home. An online survey was developed to capture parents' experiences, information and support needs, and decision-making, using closed statements and open text boxes. Descriptive quantitative analyses and qualitative thematic content analysis were undertaken. Findings 171 parents\/caregivers completed the survey. 85% of parents worried about the virus and the majority of parents were vigilant about virus (92%) or cancer symptoms (93.4%). For two-thirds (69.6%) hospital was no longer considered a safe place. Parents worried about their own health (81.1%) and about the child getting the virus from them (89.1%). Eight overarching themes, related to the virus: 1) risk of infection, 2) information, guidance and advice, 3) health care provision, 4) fears and anxieties; or related to lockdown\/isolation: 5) psychological and social impact, 6) keeping safe under lockdown, 7) provisions and dependence, and 8) employment and income. Interpretation This is the first study to report experiences of parents of a child with cancer during the SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrated that the majority of parents are worried about SARS-CoV-2, and worried about transmitting the virus to their child. Hospital was no longer a safe place, and parents were worried about suboptimal cancer care. Parents describe fear and anxiety and the psychological, social and economic impact of isolation as a family.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Darlington","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Jessica E Morgan","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Richard Wagland","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Samantha Sodergren","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Culliford","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Ashley Gamble","author_inst":"CCLG"},{"author_name":"Bob Phillips","author_inst":"Centre for Reviews and Dissemination"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128132","rel_title":"The curvilinear relationship between the age of adults and their mental health in Iran after its peak of COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128132","rel_abs":"The emerging body of research on the predictors of mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed contradictory findings, which prevent effective psychiatry screening for mental health assistance.

We conducted a survey of 474 adults in Iran during April 1-10, 2020, when Iran had just passed its first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with new confirmed cases. We found that Age had a curvilinear relationship with nonsomatic pain, depression, and anxiety. Age was associated with pain, depression, and anxiety disorders negatively among adults younger than 45 years, but positively among seniors older than 70 years. Adults who were female, unsure about their chronic diseases, and exercised less per day were more likely to have mental health issues. This study advances the use of age as an effective predictor by uncovering a curvilinear relationship between individuals' age and mental health issues by using a sample of adults across a wide spectrum of ages.

The various forms of interventions and measures adopted to control the disease affected people's social and behavioural practices. Aim This study aims to investigate COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) as well as misconceptions in Katsina state, one of the largest epicentres of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. Methods The study is cross-sectional survey of 722 respondents using electronic questionnaire through the WhatsApp media platform. Results One thousand five hundred (1500) questionnaires were sent to the general public with a response rate of 48% (i.e. 722 questionnaires completed and returned). Among the respondents, 60% were men, 45% were 25-39 years of age, 56% held bachelor's degree\/equivalent and above and 54% were employed. The study participants correct rate in the knowledge questionnaire was 80% suggesting high knowledge on the disease. A significant correlation (P < 0.05) exists between the average knowledge score of the participants and their level of education (Kendall's tau = 0.16). Overall, most of the participants agreed that the COVID-19 will be successfully controlled (84%) and the Nigerian government will win the fight against the pandemic (71%). Men were more likely than female (P < 0.05) to have recently attended a crowded place. Being more educated (bachelor's degree or equivalent and above vs diploma or equivalent and below) is associated with good COVID-19 related practices. Among the participants, 83% held at least one COVID-19 related misconception with the most frequent being that the virus was created in a laboratory (36%). Participants with lower level of education received and trust COVID-19 related information from local radio and television stations and participants at all levels of education selected that they would trust health unit and health care workers for COVID-19 related information. Conclusion Although there is high COVID-19 related knowledge among the sample, misconceptions are widespread among the participants. These misconceptions have consequences on the short- and long-term control efforts against the disease and hence should be incorporated in targeted campaigns. Health care related personnel should be in the fore front of the campaign.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Murtala Bindawa Isah","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Mahmud Abdulsalam","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Abubakar Bello","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Muawiyya Idris Ibrahim","author_inst":"Umaru Musa yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Aminu Usman","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Abdullahi Nasir","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Bashir Abdulkadir","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Rufai Usman","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Kabir Ibrahim Matazu","author_inst":"Umaru Musa Yar'adua University"},{"author_name":"Aminu Sani","author_inst":"Nigeria Defence Academy"},{"author_name":"Ma'awuya Aliu","author_inst":"Katsina State Ministry of Health, Katsina State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Shema'u Abba Kabir","author_inst":"Katsina State Primary Healthcare Agency, Katsina State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abdullahi Shuaibu","author_inst":"National Polio Emergency Operations Center, Abuja, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Shafique Sani Nass","author_inst":"World Health Organization, North-West Zonal Office, Nigeria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128561","rel_title":"Determinants of COVID-19 incidence and mortality: A cross-country analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128561","rel_abs":"The authors have withdrawn this manuscript because the source data was last updated at the end of March, and hence the authors believe that the results derived and conclusions drawn in the manuscript may not hold true now.

We assess transmission risk by: (1) workplace size, (2) human interactions, (3) inability to work from home, and (4) industry size. We found that the industry with the highest estimated economic impact from COVID-19 was manufacturing in 40 states; the industry with the largest transmission risk index was accommodation and food services in 41 states, and the industry with the highest economic impact per unit of transmission risk, interpreted as the value of reopening, was manufacturing in 37 states.

In this manuscript, we prove that the method of using the cumulative CFR is static and does not reflect the trend according to the daily change per unit of time. A proportion meta-analysis was carried out on CFR in every country reporting COVID-19 cases. Based on the results, we performed a meta-analysis for global COVID-19 CFR. Each analysis was performed on two different calculations of CFR: according to calendar date and according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case. We thus explored an innovative and original calculation of CFR concurrently based on the date of the first confirmed case as well as on a daily basis. For the first time, we showed that using meta-analyses, according to calendar date and days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case were different. We propose that CFR according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case might be a better predictor of the current CFR of COVID-19 and its kinetics. Keywords: COVID-19, case fatality rate, proportion meta-analysis, calendar date, days since first confirmed case.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramy Abou Ghayda","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Keum Hwa Lee","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Young Joo Han","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Changwon Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School  of Medicine, Changwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Seohyun Ryu","author_inst":"Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Sung Hwi Hong","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

By applying our CRP-based method to align the progression of neutrophils and lymphocytes, we were able to define a pathophysiological window that allowed further mortality risk stratification in our COVID-19 patient cohort.

The number of COVID-19 infection has crossed 120,000 with over 3500 deaths despite a prolonged period of lockdown and restrictions in public spaces. Given the likely scale and magnitude of this pandemic, this is a modest attempt to assess its impact on the age pattern of mortality under the varying scenarios. Data and Methods Data from the Sample Registration System (SRS), covid19india.org and country-specific data from worldmeter are used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics, case fatality ratio, case fatality ratio with 14 days delay, abridged life table, years of potential life lost (YPLL), disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used. Results The case fatality ratio (CFR) with 14 days delay for India is at least twice higher (8.0) than CFR of 3.4. Considering 8% mortality rate rate and varying scenarios of community infection by 0.5%, 1% and 2%, India's life expectancy will reduce by 0.8, 1.5 and 3.0 years and potential life lost by 12.1 million, 24.3 million and 48.6 million years respectively. A community infection of 0.5% may result in DALY by 6.2 per 1000 population. Major share of PYLL and DALY is accounted for the working ages. Conclusion COVID-19 has a visible impact on mortality with loss of productive life years in working ages. The sustained effort at containing the transmission at each administrative unit is recommended to arrest mortality owing by the working ages.

However, the detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS_CoV_2) RNA from different clinical specimens after onset of symptoms is not yet well established. For guiding the selection of specimens for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, a systematic review aiming at profiling the positive detection rate from different clinical specimens using PCR was conducted. Methods: The systematic search was done using PubMed\/MEDLINE, Science direct, Google Scholar, among others. The search included studies on laboratory diagnosis of SARS_CoV_2 from different clinical specimens using PCR. Data extraction was done using Microsoft Excel spread sheet 2010 and reported according to PRISMA_P guidelines. Using Open Meta Analyst software, DerSimonian_Laird random effects analysis was performed to determine a summary estimate (positive rate [PR]\/proportions) and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results: A total of 8136 different clinical specimens were analyzed to detect SARS_CoV_2, with majority being nasopharyngeal swabs (69.6%). Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had a PR of 71.3% (95%CI:60.3%-82.3%) while no virus was detected from the urinogenital specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) specimen had the PR of 91.8% (95%CI:79.9-103.7%), followed by rectal swabs, 87.8 % (95%CI:78.6%-96.9%) then sputum, 68.1% (95%CI:56.9%-79.4%). Low PR was observed in oropharyngeal swabs, 7.6% (95%CI:5.7%-9.6%) and blood samples, 1.0% (95%CI: -0.1%-2.1%), whilst no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine samples. Nasopharyngeal swab, a widely used specimen had a PR of 45.5% (95%CI:31.2%-59.7%). Conclusion: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was highly detected in lower respiratory tract specimens while there was no detected virus in urinogenital specimens. Regarding the type of clinical specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate followed by rectal swab then sputum. Nasopharyngeal swab which is widely used had a moderate detection rate. Low positive rate was recorded in oropharyngeal swab and blood sample while no virus was found in urine samples. More importantly, the virus was detected in feces, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transmission by the fecal route.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George M.

Objective We aimed to develop a simple index for ESD to quantify the impacts of social distancing for reducing confirmed infected cases, optimal triage and care of patients for recovery, and critical care capacity for reducing death from COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants Data on the retrospective cohort of 185 countries with reported numbers on confirmed cases, recovery, and death from COVID-19 were retrieved from publicity available repository. Up to May 31, a total of 5,844,136 confirmed cases, 2,639,961 recovered, and 327,487 deaths were reported globally. Main Outcome Measures The ESD index measured by cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and recovery and case-fatality rate. Results We developed a simple index for the guidance of easing social distancing (ESD). If the ESD index is less than 1, ESD would be considered. The global ESD index declined from 3.87 at peak in March to 1.35 by the end of May, consisting of 56.76% countries\/regions (105\/185) with the ESD lower than one. Conclusion and Relevance This simple ESD index provides a quantitative assessment on whether and when to ease social distancing from local to global community.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Li-Sheng Chen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Ming-Fang Yen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chao-Chih Lai","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Emergency Department of Taipei City Hos"},{"author_name":"Chen-Yang Hsu","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Dachung Hospital, Miaoli, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Hsiu-Hsi Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Pedro D Wendel Garcia","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvio D Brugger","author_inst":"Department of Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christoph C Ganter","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"- The CoViD-19 ICU-Research Group Zurich","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"- The RISC-19-ICU Investigators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Michael Krauthammer","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto A Schuepbach","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jan Bartussek","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University and University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Marco Solmi","author_inst":"Neurosciences Department, University of Padua, Padua, Italy"},{"author_name":"Han Li","author_inst":"University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA"},{"author_name":"Louis Jacob","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Montigny-le- Bretonneux, 78180, Versailles, France."},{"author_name":"Ai Koyanagi","author_inst":"Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu, CIBERSAM, Dr. Antoni  Pujadas, 42, Sant Boi de Llobregat, 08830, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Joaquim Radua","author_inst":"Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jae Il Shin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20127993","rel_title":"Reusable Gowns for routine use in hospital and laboratory: a necessity arising of COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20127993","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has started a paradigm shift in working in a hospital or laboratory and airborne precautions have become equally significant as universal blood and body fluid precautions.

The cloth could tolerate repeated exposures to heat, alcohol, hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide, but was damaged by phenol. Since this impermeable material did not allow the air to pass, we used a cool vest made up of indigenous Khadi cloth with pockets containing phase change material. The cost of whole reusable assembly of gown and cap was Indian Rupees 250 (1 USD=76 INR).

Serum samples taken from pregnant women in 2018 were used as a negative control group with zero false positives. We also analysed samples from patients with non-COVID-19 viral infections, paraproteinaemia or autoantibodies and found false positive results in 6\/179. Modification of the sensitivity threshold to five standard deviations from the mean of the control group eliminated all false positive result in the set up cohort. We confirmed the validity of the test with a revised threshold on an independent prospective \"validation cohort\" of patient samples. Taking data from both cohorts we report a sensitivity of the Mount Sinai assay of 96.6% (28\/29) and specificity of 100% (299\/299) using a revised threshold cut-off, at a time point at least 14 days since the diagnostic antigen test. Finally, we conducted a health economic probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) on the costs of producing the tests, and the mean cost we estimate to be 13.63 pounds sterling (95%CI 9.63 - 18.40), allowing its cost effectiveness to be tested against other antibody tests. In summary, we report that the Mount Sinai IgG ELISA assay is highly sensitive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection, however modification of thresholding was required to minimise false positive results.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stuart A Rushworth","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Benjamin B Johnson","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Karen Ashurst","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rose Davidson","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Paige Paddy","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jayna J Mistry","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Moore","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Hellmich","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dylan R Edwards","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Daniela D Afonso","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Georgios Xydopoulos","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Richard Goodwin","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Javier Gomez","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard Fordham","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Kristian Bowles","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Smith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jae Il Shin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128884","rel_title":"Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on Critical Personal Protective Equipment","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128884","rel_abs":"The spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings is concerning, with healthcare workers representing a disproportionately high percentage of confirmed cases. Although SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to persist on surfaces for a number of days, the extent and duration of fomites as a mode of transmission, particularly in healthcare settings, has not been fully characterized. To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable in less than 24 hours. These findings underline the importance of appropriate handling of contaminated PPE during and following use in high-risk settings and provide interesting insight into the potential utility of cotton, including cotton masks, in limiting COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha B Kasloff","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"James E Strong","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Duane Funk","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia and Medicine, College of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Todd A Cutts","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Paige Paddy","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jayna J Mistry","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Moore","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Hellmich","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dylan R Edwards","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Daniela D Afonso","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Georgios Xydopoulos","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Richard Goodwin","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Javier Gomez","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard Fordham","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Kristian Bowles","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Smith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jae Il Shin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128074","rel_title":"Estimating the impact of physical distancing measures in containing COVID-19: an empirical analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128074","rel_abs":"Background Epidemic modelling studies predict that physical distancing is critical in containing COVID-19. However, few empirical studies have validated this finding. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of different physical distancing measures in controlling viral transmission. Methods We identified three distinct physical distancing measures with varying intensity and implemented at different times - international travel controls, restrictions on mass gatherings, and lockdown-type measures - based on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) for 142 countries and tracked Rt temporally for two weeks following the 100th reported case in each country. We regressed Rt on the physical distancing measures and other control variables (income, population density, age structure, and temperature) and performed several robustness checks to validate our findings. Findings Complete travel bans and all forms of lockdown-type measures have been effective in reducing average Rt over the 14 days following the 100th case. Recommended stay-at-home advisories and partial lockdowns are as effective as complete lockdowns in outbreak control. However, these measures have to be implemented early to be effective. Lockdown-type measures should be instituted two weeks before the 100th case and travel bans about a week before detection of the first case. Interpretation A combination of physical distancing measures, if implemented early, can be effective in containing COVID-19 - tight border controls to limit importation of cases, encouraging physical distancing, moderately stringent measures such as working from home, and a full lockdown in the case of a probable uncontrolled outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam; The World Bank, Washington, DC"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Todd A Cutts","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Paige Paddy","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jayna J Mistry","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Moore","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Hellmich","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dylan R Edwards","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Daniela D Afonso","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Georgios Xydopoulos","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Richard Goodwin","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Javier Gomez","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard Fordham","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Kristian Bowles","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Smith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jae Il Shin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20129023","rel_title":"How far Covid19 virus spread can be curbed byrelaxing lockdown in different stages? -A study inIndian scenario","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20129023","rel_abs":"After the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has rapidly spread out to other provinces , neighboring countries and finally has become a global terror. It is indeed a matter of serious concern to study the transmission dynamics of this virus. The potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity can be well understood by the unknown basic reproduction number. A stochastic model can be used to estimate this number with possible safeguard on uncertainties. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection and how long they should be maintained. A short-term forecast of incidences are often of high priority. The challenge is to forecast unseen future simulated data for three different scenarios at some time points. We estimate current levels of transmissibility, over variable time points under different levels of interventions and use that to forecast near-future incidence. The forecasted values of incidence can be used for determining the near future mortality also.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arindom Chakraborty","author_inst":"Visva-Bharati University"},{"author_name":"Kalyan Das","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Todd A Cutts","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Paige Paddy","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jayna J Mistry","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Moore","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Hellmich","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dylan R Edwards","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Daniela D Afonso","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Georgios Xydopoulos","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Richard Goodwin","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Javier Gomez","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Reenesh Prakash","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samir Dervisevic","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard Fordham","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Kristian Bowles","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Smith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jae Il Shin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128272","rel_title":"Estimating the Effect and Cost-Effectiveness of Facemasks in Reducing the Spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Uganda","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128272","rel_abs":"Evidence that face masks provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce. However, face masks are widely used by health workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections. It would therefore be reasonable to suggest that consistent widespread use of face masks in the community could prevent further spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study we examine public face mask wearing in Uganda where a proportion wears masks to protect against acquiring, and the other to prevent from transmitting SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to determine what percentage of the population would have to wear face masks to reduce susceptibility to and infectivity of COVID-19 in Uganda, keeping the basic reproduction number below unity and\/or flattening the curve. We used an SEIAQRD model for the analysis. Results show that implementation of facemasks has a relatively large impact on the size of the coronavirus epidemic in Uganda. We find that the critical mask adherence is 5 per 100 when 80% wear face masks. A cost-effective analysis shows that utilizing funds to provide 1 public mask to the population has a per capita compounded cost of USD 1.34. If provision of face masks is done simultaneously with supportive care, the per capita compounded cost is USD 1.965, while for the case of only treatment and no provision of face masks costs each Ugandan USD 4.0579. We conclude that since it is hard to achieve a 100% adherence to face masks, government might consider provision of face masks in conjunction with provision of care.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Betty K Nannyonga","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, College of Natural Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Rhoda K Wanyenze","author_inst":"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Pontiano Kaleebu","author_inst":"Uganda Virus Research Institute; MRC\/UVRI & LSHTM Uganda Research Unit"},{"author_name":"John M Ssenkusu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Tom Lutalo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Fredrick Edward Makumbi","author_inst":"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Arthur Kwizera","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia & Critical care, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Pauline Byakika","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Willford Kirungi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Henry Kyobe Bosa","author_inst":"Uganda Peoples Defense Forces"},{"author_name":"Vincent A Ssembatya","author_inst":"Directorate of Quality Assurance Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Henry G Mwebesa","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Diana Atwine","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Jane Ruth Aceng","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Yonas Woldermariam Tegegn","author_inst":"World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Richard Fordham","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Kristian Bowles","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Smith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jae Il Shin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128520","rel_title":"COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown: response time is more important than its strictness","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128520","rel_abs":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its threat to health systems worldwide have led governments to take acute actions to enforce social distancing.

In order to permit the mon- itoring of the evolution of this number, a new estimation procedure is proposed here, assuming a well-accepted model for current incidence data, based on past observa- tions. The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold: 1) the estimation of the repro- duction number is achieved by convex optimization within a proximal-based inverse problem formulation, with constraints aimed at promoting piecewise smoothness; 2) the approach is developed in a multivariate setting, allowing for the simultaneous handling of multiple time series attached to different geographical regions, together with a spatial (graph-based) regularization of their evolutions in time. The effectiveness of the approach is first supported by simulations, and two main applications to real COVID-19 data are then discussed. The first one refers to the comparative evolution of the reproduction number for a number of countries, while the second one focuses on French counties and their joint analysis, leading to dynamic maps revealing the temporal co-evolution of their reproduction numbers.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"patrice abry","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"nelly pustelnik","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"stephane roux","author_inst":"ENS Lyon"},{"author_name":"pablo jensen","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Patrick Flandrin","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"remi gribonval","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Charles G Lucas","author_inst":"ENS de Lyon"},{"author_name":"eric guichard","author_inst":"ENSSIB"},{"author_name":"Pierre Borgnat","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"nicolas garnier","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"benjamin audit","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Henry G Mwebesa","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Diana Atwine","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Jane Ruth Aceng","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Yonas Woldermariam Tegegn","author_inst":"World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Richard Fordham","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Kristian Bowles","author_inst":"Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Smith","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jae Il Shin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128801","rel_title":"Early epidemic spread, percolation and Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128801","rel_abs":"Human to human transmissible infectious diseases spread in a population using human interactions as its transmission vector.

The data conditioned on are the daily numbers of accumulated deaths and the number of hospitalized. Also, it is possible to condition on the number of cases obtained from testing. We start from a wide prior distribution for the model parameters; then, the ensemble conditioning leads to a posterior ensemble of estimated parameters leading to model predictions in close agreement with the observations. The updated ensemble of model simulations have predictive capabilities and include uncertainty estimates. In particular, we estimate the effective reproductive number as a function of time, and we can assess the impact of different intervention measures. By starting from the updated set of model parameters, we can make accurate short-term predictions of the epidemic development given knowledge of the future effective reproductive number. Also, the model system allows for the computation of long-term scenarios of the epidemic under different assumptions. We have applied the model system on data sets from several countries with vastly different developments of the epidemic, and we can accurately model the development of the COVID-19 outbreak in these countries. We realize that more complex models, e.g., with regional compartments, may be desirable, and we suggest that the approach used here should be applicable also for these models.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Geir Evensen","author_inst":"NORCE"},{"author_name":"Javier Amezcua","author_inst":"University of Reading"},{"author_name":"Marc Bocquet","author_inst":"CEREA, joint laboratory Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and EDF R&D Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, France"},{"author_name":"Alberto Carrassi","author_inst":"University of Reading, Reading, UK"},{"author_name":"Alban Farchi","author_inst":"CEREA, joint laboratory Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and EDF R&D Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, France"},{"author_name":"Alison Fowler","author_inst":"University of Reading, Reading, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Houtekamer","author_inst":"Environment and Climate Change Canada, Dorval, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Christopher K.

In this work we examine how rapid countries responded to this pandemic using two events: the day in which the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and first day in which countries used school closure as one of the measures to avoid outbreaks. Methods We compiled information from multiple sources, from December 31st 2019 to June 1st 2020, to trace when 172 countries reported their first COVID-19 case and implemented school closure to contain outbreaks. We applied cross-national Weibull survival analysis to evaluate the global speed of detection of first COVID-19 reported cases and school closure. We also assessed how health systems, globalization, economic development, political systems, and economic integration to China, Republic of Korea and Italy increased the speed of adoption. Results Ten days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be an international emergency, countries were 28 (95% CI: 12,77) times more likely to report first COVID-19 cases and 42 (95% CI: 22,90) times more likely to close schools. One standard deviation increase in the epidemic security index rises the rate of report first cases by 37% (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.37 (95% CI: 1.09,1.72) and delays the adoption for school closures by 36% (HR 0.64 (95% CI:0.50,0.82). One standard deviation increase in the globalization index augments the adoption for school closures by 74% (HR 1.74 (95% CI:1.34,2.24). Conclusion. After the WHO declared a global emergency, countries were unprecedently acting very rapidly. While countries more globally integrated were swifter in closing schools, countries with better designed health systems to tackle epidemics were slower in adopting it. More studies are needed to assess how the speed of school closures and other policies will affect the development of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Ignacio Nazif-Munoz","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Youssef Oulhote","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Pena","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Carrassi","author_inst":"University of Reading, Reading, UK"},{"author_name":"Alban Farchi","author_inst":"CEREA, joint laboratory Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and EDF R&D Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, France"},{"author_name":"Alison Fowler","author_inst":"University of Reading, Reading, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Houtekamer","author_inst":"Environment and Climate Change Canada, Dorval, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Christopher K.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on the emotional well-being of oncology providers across the United States and explore factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional survey was administered to United States cancer-care physicians recruited over a two-week period (3\/27\/2020-4\/10\/2020) using snowball-convenience sampling through social media. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Results: Of 486 participants, 374 (77.0%) completed the PHQ-4: mean age 45.7 +\/- 9.6 years; 63.2% female; all oncologic specialties were represented. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 62.0% and 23.5%, respectively. Demographic factors associated with anxiety included female sex, younger age, and less time in clinical practice. Perception of inadequate PPE (68.6% vs. 57.4%, p=0.03) and practicing in a state with more COVID-19 cases (65.8% vs. 51.1%, p=0.01) were associated with anxiety symptoms. Factors significantly associated with both anxiety and depression included: degree to which COVID-19 has interfered with the ability to provide treatment to cancer patients and concern that patients will not receive the level of care needed for non-COVID-19 illness (all p-values <0.01). Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among oncology physicians in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Our findings highlight factors associated with and sources of psychological distress to be addressed to protect the well-being of oncology physicians.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren Thomaier","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deanna Teoh","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Patricia Jewett","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Heather Beckwith","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Helen Parsons","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jianling Yuan","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Anne H.

Although SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid restricted tests showed a better sensitivity, spike based assays had a stronger correlation with neutralisation capacity.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisa Mueller","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Niklas Ostermann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Wienemann","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mertens","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ortwin Adams","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marcel Andree","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hauka","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nadine Luebke","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Verena Keitel","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ingo Drexler","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Veronica Di Cristanziano","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Derik Franz Hermsen","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical Faculty, University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rolf Kaiser","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Friedrich Boege","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical Faculty, University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20122374","rel_title":"Temporal clinical and laboratory response to interleukin-6 receptor blockade with Tocilizumab in 89 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20122374","rel_abs":"Abstract: Background:. Emerging evidence links morbidity and mortality of pandemic COVID-19 pneumonia to an inflammatory cytokine storm. Methods: Eighty nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and heightened systemic inflammation (elevated serum C reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels) were treated with Tocilizumab (TCZ), a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor. Results: Clinical and laboratory improvement was seen comparing baseline and 1-2 day post-infusion indices. Among 72 patients not receiving mechanical ventilation, NEWS2 scores fell from 5 to 2 (p <0.001) C reactive protein levels fell from 95 to 14 mg\/L (p <0.001) and lymphocyte counts rose from 900 to 1000\/uL (p=0.036). Sixty three of 72 patients were discharged from hospital, one patient died, and 8 remained in hospital at time of writing. Among 17 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, despite a rapid decrease in CRP levels from 89 to 35 mg\/L (p = 0.014) and early improvements in NEWS2 scores in 10 of 17, ten patients died and seven remain in hospital at time of writing. Overall, mortality was only seen in patients who had markedly elevated CRP levels (>30 mg\/L) and low lymphocyte counts (<1000\/uL) before TCZ administration. Conclusions: Inflammation and lymphocytopenia are linked to mortality in COVID-19. Inhibition of IL-6 activity by administration of Tocilizumab, an anti IL-6 receptor antibody is associated with rapid improvement in both CRP and lymphocyte counts and in clinical indices. Controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the utility of IL-6 blockade in this setting. Additional interventions will be needed for patients requiring mechanical ventilation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daria S Formina","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Mar'yana A Lysenko","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Irina P Beloglazova","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"zinaida Y Mutinova","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Nataliya G Poteshkina","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Inna V Samsonova","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Tat'yana S Kruglova","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Anton A Chernov","author_inst":"City Clinical Hospital No.52 of Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Alexander V Karaulov","author_inst":"First Sechenov Moscow state medical University of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Michael M Lederman","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Ingo Drexler","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Veronica Di Cristanziano","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Derik Franz Hermsen","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical Faculty, University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rolf Kaiser","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Friedrich Boege","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical Faculty, University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tina Senff","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lee Smith","author_inst":"The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128249","rel_title":"Evolution and epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128249","rel_abs":"Brazil currently has one of the fastest growing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in the world. Due to limited available data, assessments of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on virus transmission and epidemic spread remain challenging. We investigate the impact of NPIs in Brazil using epidemiological, mobility and genomic data. Mobility-driven transmission models for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro cities show that the reproduction number (Rt) reached below 1 following NPIs but slowly increased to values between 1 to 1.3 (1.0 - -1.6). Genome sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a geographically representative genomic dataset from 21 of the 27 Brazilian states identified >100 international introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. We estimate that three clades introduced from Europe emerged between 22 and 27 February 2020, and were already well-established before the implementation of NPIs and travel bans. During this first phase of the epidemic establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, we find that the virus spread mostly locally and within-state borders. Despite sharp decreases in national air travel during this period, we detected a 25% increase in the average distance travelled by air passengers during this time period. This coincided with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from large urban centers to the rest of the country. In conclusion, our results shed light on the role of large and highly connected populated centres in the rapid ignition and establishment of SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under control in Brazil.","rel_num_authors":79,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Darlan da Silva Candido","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Univeristy of Oxford, UK."},{"author_name":"Ingra Morales Claro","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical, Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jaqueline Goes de Jesus","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical, Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"William Marciel de Souza","author_inst":"Centro de Pesquisa em Virologia, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Filipe Romero Rebello Moreira","author_inst":"Departamento de Genetica, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"Spatial Epidemiology Lab, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelas, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Thomas A.

relationship between BCG vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 by bioinformatic approach. Two datasets for Sars-CoV-2 infection group and BCG-vaccinated group were downloaded. Differentially Expressed Genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly, correlation between post-BCG vaccination and COVID-19 transcriptome signatures were established. A total of 161 DEGs (113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the Sars-CoV-2 group. In the pathway enrichment analysis, cross-reference of upregulated KEGG pathways in Sars-CoV-2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCG-vaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance in IL-17, TNF, NOD-like receptors, and NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways.

quantify immunoglobulins M, A and G against SARS-CoV-2 antigens","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.147363","rel_abs":"Reliable serological tests are required to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and to characterise immunity to the disease in order to address key knowledge gaps in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays to detect IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated the performance of the assays using 128 plasmas obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic (negative controls) and 115 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 8 were asymptomatic, 58 had mild symptoms and 49 were hospitalized. Pre-existing IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S2 proteins were detected in negative controls suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. The best performing antibody isotype\/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 94.94% at [&ge;]14 days since the onset of symptoms and 96.08% at [&ge;]21 days since the onset of symptoms, with AUC of 0.992 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple antibody markers as assessed by qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth and versatility to accurately detect low-level antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens in a population. Our assays will allow gaining insights into antibody correlates of immunity required for vaccine development to combat pandemics like the COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlota Doba\u00f1o","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Marta Vidal","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Santano","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alfons Jimenez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Jordi Chi","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Diana Barrios","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Gemma Ruiz-Olalla","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Natalia Rodrigo Melero","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Carlo Carolis","author_inst":"CRG"},{"author_name":"Daniel Parras","author_inst":"IDIBAPS"},{"author_name":"Pau Serra","author_inst":"IDIBAPS"},{"author_name":"Paula Mart\u00ednez de Aguirre","author_inst":"Cl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra"},{"author_name":"Francisco Carmona-Torre","author_inst":"Cl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Reina","author_inst":"Cl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra"},{"author_name":"Pere Santamaria","author_inst":"IDIBAPS"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mayor","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Alberto Alberto Garc\u00eda-Basteiro","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Luis Izquierdo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Ruth Aguilar","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Gemma Moncunill","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Henrique Hoeltgebaum","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, UK."},{"author_name":"Mandev Gill","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Luiz Max Carvalho","author_inst":"Getulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lewis Fletcher Buss","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical, Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Augusto Prete Jr.","author_inst":"Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jordan Ashworth","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Helder Nakaya","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Pedro da Silva Peixoto","author_inst":"Departamento de Matematica Aplicada, Instituto de Matematica e Estatistica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Brady","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Centre for the Mathe"},{"author_name":"Samuel M.
