Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. This study presents a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying nonsynonymous mutations and deletions from large dataset for any particular protein coding sequence and presents this S protein data as representative analysis. By using separate multi-sequence alignment with MAFFT, removing ambiguous sequences and in-frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive nonsynonymus mutations (Reference:Position:Strain). We believe this will aid in the surveillance of any proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and will prove to be crucial in tracking the ever-increasing variation of many other divergent RNA viruses in the future.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

We present theoretical results linking the (unobserved) parameters of the model to various quantities which are more easily measured during the early stages of an epidemic. We also stress the main quantitative differences between the non-Markovian and the Markovian (ODE) model. We then apply these results to estimate the state of the Covid-19 epidemic in France by analyzing three regions: the Paris region, the northeast regions and the rest of the country, based on current knowledge on the infection fatality ratio and the exposed and infectious periods distributions for Covid-19. Our analysis is based on the hospital data published daily by Sante Publique France (daily hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions and hospital deaths).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raphael Forien","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Guodong Pang","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Etienne Pardoux","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Universite"},{"author_name":"A.

Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells.\n\nResultsOur analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.\n\nConclusionsOur investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafeed Rahman Turjya","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin{square}converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others. We believe that the findings of this study will enable the appropriate use of the Syrian golden hamster to carryout SARS-CoV-2 related studies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Voddu Suresh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India"},{"author_name":"Deepti Parida","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India"},{"author_name":"Aliva P.

Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is sufficient to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damage in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of 2-E protein induced rapid pyroptosis-like cell death in various susceptible cells and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damage in lung and spleen. Overexpressed 2-E protein formed cation channels in host cell membranes, eventually leading to membrane rupture. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent protective effects against the 2-E-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, their channel inhibition, cell protection and antiviral activities were positively correlated with each other, supporting 2-E is a promising drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaobing Gao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Media"},{"author_name":"Bingqing Xia","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xurui Shen","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yang He","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Pan","author_inst":"Wuhan institute of virology, Chinese academy of sciences"},{"author_name":"Yi Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Feipu Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sui Fang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Zuo","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhuqing Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiangrui Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao Chi","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qian Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hu Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yubo Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Xin","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lei-Ke Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Shen","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jia Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.175844","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and boosts proinflammatory activity","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.175844","rel_abs":"ABSTRACTThere is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-\u03baB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementA.S is a founder and shareholder of in2cure AB, a company developing therapies based on host defense peptides.

We systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a large cohort of unexposed individuals as well as exposed family members and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takuya Sekine","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Andre Perez-Potti","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Olga Rivera-Ballesteros","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Straling","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Jean-Baptiste Gorin","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Annika Olsson","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Sian Llewellyn-Lacey","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK."},{"author_name":"Habiba Kamal","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Gordana Bogdanovic","author_inst":"Dept of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Sandra Muschiol","author_inst":"Dept of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"David J Wulliman","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Tobias Kammann","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Johanna Emgard","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Tiphaine Parrot","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Interventions and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Here, we investigated whether increased engagement with digital social tools may help mitigate effects of enforced isolation on physical activity and mood, in a naturalistic study of at-risk individuals. Passively sensed smartphone app use and actigraphy data, collected from a sample of psychiatric outpatients both before and during imposition of strict lockdown conditions (N=163), were analysed using Gaussian graphical models: a form of network analysis which gives insight into the predictive relationships between measures across timepoints. Within-individuals, we found evidence of a positive predictive path between digital social engagement, general smartphone use, and physical activity - selectively under lockdown conditions. Further, we observed a positive relationship between social media use and total daily steps across individuals during (but not prior to) lockdown. We interpret these findings in terms of individuals using these digital tools to harness online social support structures, which may help guard against negative effects of in-person social deprivation and other pandemic-related stress. Monitoring of these measures is low burden and unintrusive and therefore, given appropriate consent, could potentially help identify individuals who are failing to engage this mechanism, providing a route to early intervention in this and other vulnerable populations.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agnes Norbury","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shelley H Liu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Jos\u00e9 Campa\u00f1a-Montes","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Lorena Romero-Medrano","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria L Barrigon","author_inst":"University Hospital Jimenez Diaz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Emma Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- MEmind Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Antonio Artes","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Enrique Baca-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital Jimenez Diaz Foundation"},{"author_name":"M.

Objective: To quantify the economic value of the costs and benefits of a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to alternative COVID-19 response strategies in the United States. Design: We estimate the number and value of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from mortality averted, with a value of $125,000 per QALY, and compare these benefits to the associated costs in terms of plausible effects on US GDP under a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to a policy of full reopening toward herd immunity. Using the same QALY value assumptions, we further evaluate cost-effectiveness of a return to Shelter-in-Place relative to a policy of limited reopening. Setting: United States Measurements: QALY and cost as percent of GDP of limited reopening with continued social distancing relative to a strategy of full reopening aimed at achieving herd immunity; a limited reopening budget measured in the number of months before this strategy fails to demonstrate cost-effectiveness relative to a full reopening; a shelter-in-place threshold measured in the number of lives saved at which a month of sheltering in place demonstrates cost effectiveness relative to the limited reopening strategy. Results: QALY benefits from mortality averted by continued social distancing and limited reopening relative to a policy of full reopening exceed projected GDP costs if an effective vaccine or therapeutic can be developed within 11.1 months from late May 2020. White House vaccine projections fall within this date, supporting a partial reopening strategy. One month of shelter-in-place restrictions provides QALY benefits from averted mortality that exceed the associated GDP costs relative to limited reopening if the restrictions prevent at least 154,586 additional COVID-19 deaths over the course of the pandemic. Current models of disease progression suggest that limited reopening will not cause this many additional deaths, again supporting a limited reopening strategy. Limitation: Limited horizon of COVID-19 mortality projections; infection fatality ratio stable across strategies, ignoring both the potential for ICU overload to increase mortality and the deployment of partially effective therapeutics to decrease mortality; effect on GDP modeled as constant within a given phase of the pandemic; accounts for age and sex distribution of QALYs, but not effect of comorbidities; only considers impact from QALY lost due to mortality and from changes in GDP, excluding numerous other considerations, such as non-fatal COVID-19 morbidity, reduced quality of life caused by prolonged social distancing, or educational regression associated with prolonged school closures and restrictions. Conclusions: A limited reopening to achieve partial mitigation of COVID-19 is cost effective relative to a full reopening if an effective therapeutic or vaccine can be deployed within 11.1 months of late May 2020. One additional month of shelter-in-place restrictions should only be imposed if it saves at least 154,586 lives per month before the development of an effective therapeutic or vaccine relative to limited reopening.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert B Schonberger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yair J Listokin","author_inst":"Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Ian Ayres","author_inst":"Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Reza Yaesoubi","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Zachary R Shelley","author_inst":"Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Emma Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- MEmind Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Antonio Artes","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Enrique Baca-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital Jimenez Diaz Foundation"},{"author_name":"M.

WHO identified it as a novel coronavirus and declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020. At the time of writing this, the COVID-19 claimed more than 440 thousand lives worldwide and led to the global economy and social life into an abyss edge in the living memory. As of now, the confirmed cases in Bangladesh have surpassed 100 thousand and more than 1343 deaths putting startling concern on the policymakers and health professionals; thus, prediction models are necessary to forecast a possible number of cases in the future. To shed light on it, in this paper, we presented data-driven estimation methods, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Logistic Curve methods to predict the possible number of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh for the upcoming months. The results using Logistic Curve suggests that Bangladesh has passed the inflection point on around 28-30 May 2020, a plausible end date to be on the 2nd of January 2021 and it is expected that the total number of infected people to be between 187 thousand to 193 thousand with the assumption that stringent policies are in place. The logistic curve also suggested that Bangladesh would reach peak COVID-19 cases at the end of August with more than 185 thousand total confirmed cases, and around 6000 thousand daily new cases may observe. Our findings recommend that the containment strategies should immediately implement to reduce transmission and epidemic rate of COVID-19 in upcoming days.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Al-Ekram Elahee Hridoy","author_inst":"Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, University of Chittagong, Chittagong  4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Naim","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North South University, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nazim Uddin Emon","author_inst":"3Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science and Engineering, International Islamic University Chittagong, Chittagong 4318, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Imrul Hasan Tipo","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chittagong, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Safayet Alam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Al Mamun","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Chittagong  4349, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Safiqul Islam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali 3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Antonio Artes","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Enrique Baca-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital Jimenez Diaz Foundation"},{"author_name":"M.

A systematic estimation of the basic reproductive ratio R0 is made for India and for each of the selected states. The study has analysed and predicted the dynamics of the temporal progression of the disease in Indian and the selected eight states: Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. For India, the most optimistic scenario with respect to duration of the epidemic shows, the peak of infection will appear before mid September with the estimated R0=1.917, from the SEIRD model. Further, we show, a Gaussian fit of the daily incidences also indicates the peak will appear around middle of August this year. Our analyses suggest, the earliest dates when the epidemic will start to decline in most states are between Jun-August. For India, the number of infected people at the time of peak will be around 1.6 million including asymptomatic people. If the community transmission is prohibited, then the epidemic will infect not more than 3.1 million people in India. We also compared India's position in containing the disease with two countries with higher and lower number of infections than India and show the early imposition of lockdown has reduced the number of infected cases significantly.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rudra Banerjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Srijit Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Pritish Kumar Varadwaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Imrul Hasan Tipo","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chittagong, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Safayet Alam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Al Mamun","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Chittagong  4349, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Safiqul Islam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali 3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Antonio Artes","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Enrique Baca-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital Jimenez Diaz Foundation"},{"author_name":"M.

To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from nine different locations in multiple air handlers. While samples were not evaluated for viral infectivity, the presence of viral RNA in air handlers raises the possibility that viral particles can enter and travel within the air handling system of a hospital, from room return air through high efficiency MERV-15 filters and into supply air ducts. Although no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens, the findings suggest the potential for HVAC systems to facilitate transmission by environmental contamination via shared air volumes with locations remote from areas where infected persons reside. More work is needed to further evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via HVAC systems and to verify effectiveness of building operations mitigation strategies for the protection of building occupants. These results are important within and outside of healthcare settings and may present a matter of some urgency for building operators of facilities that are not equipped with high-efficiency filtration.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick F Horve","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Leslie Dietz","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"Mark Fretz","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"David A Constant","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wilkes","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"John M Townes","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Robert G Martindale","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"William B Messer","author_inst":"Oregon Health and Science University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg","author_inst":"University of Oregon"},{"author_name":"M.

However, wide deployment of CyTOF-based immune phenotyping studies are limited by complex experimental workflows and the need for specialized CyTOF equipment and technical expertise. Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can potentially confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition. We further demonstrate the application of this workflow to characterize immune responses in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, highlighting key disease-associated changes in immune cell frequency and phenotype.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Geanon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

This is especially important in real-time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, e.g., if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamic of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time-dependent case reproduction number Re(t)based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID-19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current epidemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID-19 in Bavaria. Results of our nowcasting are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis (https:\/\/corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de\/).

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 mortality, and inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection, in UK Biobank participants. Methods UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37-73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration, were linked to COVID-19 mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and COVID-19 death, and poisson regression analyses for the association between 25(OH)D and severe COVID-19 infection. Results Complete data were available for 341,484 UK Biobank participants, of which 656 had inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection and 203 died of COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality univariably (mortality HR=0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.998; p=0.016), but not after adjustment for confounders (mortality HR=0.998; 95% CI=0.99-1.01; p=0.696). Conclusions Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality. Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation to lessen COVID-19 risks may provide false reassurance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claire E Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helmut Kuechenhoff","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoehle","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shen","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Manon Herbinet","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

However, comparisons based on confirmed case counts alone can be misleading since a higher case count may reflect either a higher disease prevalence or a better rate of disease detection. Using weekly records of viral test results for each state in the US, I demonstrate how confirmed case counts can be adjusted based on the percentage of COVID-19 tests that come back positive. A regression analysis indicates that case counts track better with future hospitalizations and deaths when employing this simple adjustment for testing coverage. Viral testing results can be used as a leading indicator of COVID-19 prevalence, but data reporting standards should be improved, and care should be taken to account for testing coverage when comparing confirmed case counts.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathan Favero","author_inst":"American University"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Helmut Kuechenhoff","author_inst":"LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoehle","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shen","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Manon Herbinet","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

Objective: To determine the level of COVID-19 related transmission fear and anxiety in healthcare workers and patients with primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID), severe asthma, and the ones with other comorbidities. Methods: The healthcare workers and patients with PID, severe asthma (all patients receiving biological agent treatment), malignancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension (90% of patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy), diabetes mellitus (42 % of patients receiving DPP-4 inhibitor therapy) were included in the study. A total of 560 participants, 80 individuals in each group, were provided. The hospital anxiety and depression scale ( HADS ) and Fear of illness and virus evaluation (FIVE ) scales were applied to the groups with face to face interview methods. Results: The mean age was 49.30 years and 306 (55 %) were female. The FIVE Scale and HADS-A scale scores of health care workers were significantly higher than other groups' scores (p = 0.001 and 0.006). The second-highest scores belonged to patients with PID. There was no significant difference between the groups for the HADS-D score (p=0.07). The lowest score in all scales was observed in patients with hypertension. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that in the pandemic process, patients with primary immunodeficiency, asthma patients, and other comorbid patients, especially healthcare workers, should be referred to the centers for the detection and treatment of mental health conditions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatih Colkesen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine,"},{"author_name":"Oguzhan Kilincel","author_inst":"Department of  Psychiatry, Sakarya Yenikent State Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Sozen","author_inst":"Department of  Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kocaeli University Faculty of  Medicine"},{"author_name":"Eray Yildiz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sengul Beyaz","author_inst":"Division of  Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University"},{"author_name":"Fatma Colkesen","author_inst":"Department of  Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, University of  Health Sciences, Konya Training and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gokhan Aytekin","author_inst":"Department of  Clinical Immunology and Allergy, University of  Health Sciences, Konya Training and Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Zahit Kocak","author_inst":"Department of  Medical Oncology, Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Yakup Alsancak","author_inst":"Department of  Cardiology , Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Murat Araz","author_inst":"Department of  Medical Oncology, Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Sevket Arslan","author_inst":"Department of  Clinical Immunology and Allergy,   Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of  Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Johanna Emgard","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Tiphaine Parrot","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Interventions and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

The pandemic is still growing in many areas. Among the core measures to prevent disease spread is the use of face masks. We observed 12,588 people in five Brazilian cities within the Baixada Santista metropolitan area. Even though this is densely populated region and heavily impacted by COVID-19 with a high risk population, only 45.1% of the observed population wore in face masks in a correct way, and another 15.5% simply did not use masks at all. The remainder used masks incorrectly, which is evidence of the worst scenario of people believing that they are protected when they are not. This is among the first studies, to the best of our knowledge, that measures real life compliance with face masks during this COVID-19 pandemic. It is our conclusion that it is paramount to first control the virus before allowing people back in the streets. We should not assume that people will wear masks properly. Equally important is to instruct and sensitize people on how to use face masks and why it is important.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Evaldo Stanislau Affonso de Ara\u00fajo","author_inst":"1.

Since then, the situation has worsened with more than 672,000 confirmed cases and at least 36,000 reported deaths at the time of this writing. Accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 is extremely important to offer adequate treatment, and avoid overloading the healthcare system. Characteristics of patients such as age, comorbidities and varied clinical symptoms can help in classifying the level of infection severity, predict the disease outcome and the need for hospitalization. Here, we present a study to predict a poor prognosis in positive COVID-19 patients and possible outcomes using machine learning. The study dataset comprises information of 13,690 patients concerning closed cases due to cure or death. Our experimental results show the disease outcome can be predicted with a ROC AUC of 0.92, Sensitivity of 0.88 and Specificity of 0.82 for the best prediction model. This is a preliminary retrospective study which can be improved with the inclusion of further data. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques fed with demographic and clinical data along with comorbidities of the patients can assist in the prognostic prediction and physician decision-making, allowing a faster response and contributing to the non-overload of healthcare systems.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Sumika Hojo Souza","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Nat\u00e1lia Satchiko Hojo-Souza","author_inst":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Edimilson Batista Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Cristiano Maciel Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ludovico Guidoni","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Gutierrez Karl","author_inst":"Sao Judas Tadeu University, Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sheila J Henderson","author_inst":"Alliant International University"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Zahit Kocak","author_inst":"Department of  Medical Oncology, Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Yakup Alsancak","author_inst":"Department of  Cardiology , Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Murat Araz","author_inst":"Department of  Medical Oncology, Meram Faculty of  Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University"},{"author_name":"Sevket Arslan","author_inst":"Department of  Clinical Immunology and Allergy,   Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of  Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Johanna Emgard","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Tiphaine Parrot","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Interventions and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

The factors that are considered for the effective reuse of these masks are the fit, filter efficiency and decontamination\/disinfection level both for SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative virus for COVID-19, and for other organisms of concern in the hospital environment such as Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile. In its guidance entitled 'Recommendations for Sponsors Requesting EUAs for Decontamination and Bioburden Reduction Systems for Surgical Masks and Respirators During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) Public Health Emergency' (May 2020)[1], the FDA recommends a 6-log10 reduction in either the most resistant bacterial spores for the system or in a mycobacterium species to authorize the use of a decontamination method of N95 respirators for single or multiple users. While the goal is primarily inactivation against SARS-CoV-2, testing of decontamination methods against the virus may not always be available. For decontamination methods considered for only single users, the recommendation is a 6-log10 reduction in the infective virus concentration of 3 non-enveloped viruses or in the concentration of two Gram (+) and two Gram (-) bacteria. Based on these recommendations, we explored the efficacy of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) treatment of N95 respirators against surrogate viruses covering a wide range of disinfection resistance for emergency decontamination and reuse to alleviate PPE shortages for healthcare workers in the COVID-19 emergency.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ebru Oral","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Keith K Wannomae","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachel L Connolly","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Gardecki","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Min Leung","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Orhun K Muratoglu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"John Durkin","author_inst":"B & V Testing"},{"author_name":"Ralph Jones","author_inst":"B & V Testing"},{"author_name":"Cassidy Collins","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Julian Gjore","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Amanda Budzilowicz","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Tareq Jaber","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Johanna Emgard","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Tiphaine Parrot","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Interventions and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

We evaluated to what extent these changes have affected quality of life and physical, and psychosocial wellbeing of people (being) treated for breast cancer. Methods: This study was conducted within the prospective Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaluation (UMBRELLA). Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, extra questionnaires were sent to 1595 cohort participants, including standard UMBRELLA quality of life (EORTC) questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared to the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA before COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was evaluated using mixed models analysis. Results: In total, 1051 patients (66%) completed the questionnaires. One third (n = 327, 31%) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19. A significant deterioration in emotional functioning was observed (82.6 to 77.9, p < 0.001) and 505 (48%, 95% CI 45-51) patients reported moderate to severe loneliness. Small significant improvements were observed in QoL, physical-, social- and role functioning scores. In the subgroup of 51 patients under active treatment, there was a strong deterioration in social functioning (69.8 to 5.0, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Due to COVID-19, patients (being) treated for breast cancer are less likely to contact physicians, and experience a deterioration in emotional functioning. Patients undergoing active treatment report a strong drop in social functioning. One in two patients reports (severe) loneliness. Online applications facilitating peer contact and e-mental health interventions could support mental health and social interaction times of total lockdown or social distancing.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia A Bargon","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Marilot CT Batenburg","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Lilianne E van Stam","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Dieuwke R Mink van der Molen","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Iris E van Dam","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Femke van der Leij","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Inge O Baas","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Miranda F Ernst","author_inst":"Alexander Monro Clinics"},{"author_name":"Wiesje Maarse","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Nieke Vermulst","author_inst":"Rivierenland Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ernst JP Schoenmaeckers","author_inst":"Meander Medisch Centrum"},{"author_name":"Thijs van Dalen","author_inst":"Diakonessenhuis"},{"author_name":"Rhode M Bijlsma","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Danny A Young-Afat","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Annemiek Doeksen","author_inst":"St. Antonius Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helena M Verkooijen","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

In the absence of efficient therapeutics or vaccines, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 547 published governmental interventions, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were used to calibrate the model parameters using non-linear least squares methods. We analyze the changes on the TR and effective reproduction number as a function of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states as well as population movement. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions, and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel C.

It can be performed by clinicians already at the bedside, which permits an immediate and augmented assessment of a patient. Although lung ultrasound can be used to accurately diagnose a variety of disease states such as pneumothorax, pleural effusions, pneumonia and interstitial lung disease2, there are limited reports on the sonographic manifestations of COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify alternative diagnostic modalities that can be immediately employed at the bedside of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study was conducted at two medical centers in the United States from 3\/21\/2020-6\/01\/2020. Any adult who was hospitalized with COVID-19 (based on symptomatology and a confirmatory RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) and received a pulmonary POCUS examination was included. Providers were instructed to use a 12-zone scanning protocol for pulmonary views and save 6 second clips of each lung zone. This study utilized several POCUS devices, including Butterfly IQ, Vave, Lumify, and Sonosite. The collected images were interpreted by the study researchers based on a consensus document developed by the study authors and previously accepted definitions of lung POCUS findings. Results: A total of 22 eligible patients who received 36 lung scans were included in our study. Eleven (50%) patients experienced clinical deterioration (defined as either ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days from the initial symptom onset). Among the 36 lung scans collected, only 3 (8%) were classified as normal. The remaining scans had the following abnormalities: presence of B-lines (n=32, 89%), consolidations (n=20, 56%), pleural thickening (n=17, 47%), and pleural effusion (n=4, 11%). Out of 20 scans with consolidations, 14 (70%) were subpleural and 5 (25%) were translobar. A-lines were present in 26 (72%) of patients, although they were only observed in the majority of the collected lung zones in 5 (14%) of patients. Ultrasound findings were stratified by time from symptom onset to the scan based on the following time periods: early (0-6 days), middle (7-13 days), and late (14-28 days). B-lines appeared early after symptom onset and persisted well into the late disease course. In contrast, pleural thickening increased in frequency over time (early: 25%, middle: 47%, late: 67%). Subpleural consolidations also appeared in higher frequency later in the disease course (early: 13%, middle 42%, late: 56%). Discussion: certain lung ultrasound findings may be common in Covid-19, while others may appear later in the disease course or only occur in patients who experience clinical deterioration. Future efforts should investigate the predictive utility of consolidations, pleural thickening and B-lines for clinical deterioration and compare them to traditional radiological studies such as X-rays or CTs.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre D Kumar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sukyung Chung","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Youyou Duanmu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sally Graglia","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Farhan Lalani","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kavita Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Viveta Lobo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Trevor Jensen","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Weng","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Nahn","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John Kugler","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Juliane Fonseca Oliveira","author_inst":"Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health, Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Rhode M Bijlsma","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Danny A Young-Afat","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Annemiek Doeksen","author_inst":"St. Antonius Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helena M Verkooijen","author_inst":"UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Lars I Eriksson","author_inst":"Function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

A comprehensive analysis of the antibody responses in potential plasma donors and an understanding of the clinical and demographic factors that drive variant antibody responses is needed. Among 126 potential convalescent plasma donors, the humoral immune response was evaluated by a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay using Vero-E6-TMPRSS2 cells, commercial IgG and IgA ELISA to Spike (S) protein S1 domain (Euroimmun), IgA, IgG and IgM indirect ELISAs to the full-length S or S-receptor binding domain (S-RBD), and an IgG avidity assay. Multiple linear regression and predictive models were utilized to assess the correlations between antibody responses with demographic and clinical characteristics. IgG titers were greater than either IgM or IgA for S1, full length S, and S-RBD in the overall population. Of the 126 plasma samples, 101 (80%) had detectable neutralizing titers. Using neutralization titer as the reference, the sensitivity of the IgG ELISAs ranged between 95-98%, but specificity was only 20-32%. Male sex, older age, and hospitalization with COVID-19 were all consistently associated with increased antibody responses across the serological assays. Neutralizing antibody titers were reduced over time in contrast to overall antibody responses. There was substantial heterogeneity in the antibody response among potential convalescent plasma donors, but sex, age and hospitalization emerged as factors that can be used to identify individuals with a high likelihood of having strong antiviral antibody levels.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabra Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pekosz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Han-Sol Park","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Ursin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janna Shapiro","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Benner","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Littlefield","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Swetha Kumar","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harnish Mukesh Naik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Betenbaugh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Ruchee Shrestha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Annie Wu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Hughes","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Imani Burgess","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricio Caturegli","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Thomas Quinn","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"David Sullivan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Shoham","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Redd","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Johan K Sandberg","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"David A Price","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.

Many of these patients require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for invasive artificial ventilation and are at significant risk of developing a secondary, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Objectives To study the incidence of VAP, as well as differences in secondary infections, and bacterial lung microbiome composition of ventilated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Methods In this prospective observational study, we compared the incidence of VAP and secondary infections using a combination of a TaqMan multi-pathogen array and microbial culture. In addition, we determined the lung microbime composition using 16S RNA analyisis. The study involved eighteen COVID-19 and seven non-COVID-19 patients receiving invasive ventilation in three ICUs located in a single University teaching hospital between April 13th 2020 and May 7th 2020. Results We observed a higher percentage of confirmed VAP in COVID-19 patients. However, there was no statistical difference in the detected organisms or pulmonary microbiome when compared to non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusion COVID-19 makes people more susceptible to developing VAP, partly but not entirely due to the increased duration of ventilation. The pulmonary dysbiosis caused by COVID-19, and the array of secondary infections observed are similar to that seen in critically ill patients ventilated for other reasons.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mailis Maes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ellen Higginson","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Joana Pereira Dias","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cuchet-Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Janine Lux","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sapna Sharma-Hajela","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ravenhill","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Amelia Solderholm","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sally Forrest","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"Wellcome  Sanger Insitute, Hinxton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Johan K Sandberg","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"David A Price","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.

Aims To test whether the prevalence of problem drinking has changed from before to during the COVID-19 crisis in the US and UK. Design\/Setting We examined nationally representative longitudinal data on how problem drinking has changed from pre-pandemic levels among adults in the US (N=7,327; Understanding America Study) and UK (N=12,594; UK Household Longitudinal Study). Methods In the US, we examined rates of consuming alcohol [&ge;] 4 times in the past week at baseline (March, 2020) and across four waves of follow-up (April-May, 2020). In the UK we assessed the prevalence of consuming alcohol [&ge;] 4 times per week and weekly heavy episodic drinking using the AUDIT-C at baseline (2017-2019) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). We also tested whether there were specific groups at greater risk of increased problem drinking during the pandemic. Results Among US adults, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of participants reporting drinking alcohol [&ge;] 4 times a week which rose significantly from 11.7% to 17.9% (53% increase, p < .001) as the COVID-19 crisis developed in the US. Among UK adults, the percentage of participants reporting drinking [&ge;] 4 times a week increased significantly from 14.2% to 23% (62% increase, p < .001) and heavy episodic drinking at least weekly increased significantly from 9.7% to 16.6% (71% increase, p < .001) when compared to pre-COVID-19 lockdown levels. Trends were similar across population demographics, although those aged under 50 years and higher income groups displayed the largest increases. Conclusions The COVID-19 crisis has been associated with substantial increases in problematic drinking in both US and UK adults.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Daly","author_inst":"Maynooth University"},{"author_name":"Eric Robinson","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Joana Pereira Dias","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cuchet-Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Janine Lux","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sapna Sharma-Hajela","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ravenhill","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Amelia Solderholm","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sally Forrest","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"Wellcome  Sanger Insitute, Hinxton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Johan K Sandberg","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"David A Price","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.

Higher prevalence among returning laborers may also reflect greater COVID spread in crowded poor communities such as slums.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anup Malani","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Manoj Mohanan","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Chanchal Kumar","author_inst":"Government of Bihar"},{"author_name":"Jake Kramer","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vaidehi Tandel","author_inst":"IDFC Institute"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cuchet-Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Janine Lux","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sapna Sharma-Hajela","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ravenhill","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Amelia Solderholm","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sally Forrest","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"Wellcome  Sanger Insitute, Hinxton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Johan K Sandberg","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"David A Price","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.

Comparison of locations with over 50 deaths shows all outbreaks have a common feature: H(t) defined as loge(X(t)\/X(t 1)) decreases linearly on a log scale, where X(t) is the total number of Cases or Deaths on day, t (we use ln for loge). The downward slopes vary by about a factor of three with time constants (1\/slope) of between 1 and 3 weeks; this suggests it may be possible to predict when an outbreak will end. Is it possible to go beyond this and perform early prediction of the outcome in terms of the eventual plateau number of total confirmed cases or deaths? We test this hypothesis by showing that the trajectory of cases or deaths in any outbreak can be converted into a straight line. Specifically , is a straight line for the correct plateau value N, which is determined by a new method, Best-Line Fitting (BLF). BLF involves a straight-line facilitation extrapolation needed for prediction; it is blindingly fast and amenable to optimization. We find that in some locations that entire trajectory can be predicted early, whereas others take longer to follow this simple functional form. Fortunately, BLF distinguishes predictions that are likely to be correct in that they show a stable plateau of total cases or death (N value). We apply BLF to locations that seem close to a stable predicted N value and then forecast the outcome at some locations that are still growing wildly. Our accompanying web-site will be updated frequently and provide all graphs and data described here.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Levitt","author_inst":"Stanford School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scaiewicz","author_inst":"Stanford School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Zonta","author_inst":"ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jake Kramer","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vaidehi Tandel","author_inst":"IDFC Institute"},{"author_name":"Fahad Khokhar","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cuchet-Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Janine Lux","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sapna Sharma-Hajela","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ravenhill","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Amelia Solderholm","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sally Forrest","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"Wellcome  Sanger Insitute, Hinxton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Nicholas M Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England, Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman ICU, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evan Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Johan K Sandberg","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"David A Price","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.
