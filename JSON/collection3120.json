A recent meta-analysis suggested that testing prior to the onset of symptoms is likely to miss the majority of infected individuals. These findings cast severe doubts on the effectiveness of mass screening efforts intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 prior to the onset of symptoms and decrease community transmissions from pre-\/asymptomatic individuals. However, alternative analyses and additional data described herein refine these estimates and suggest that many SARS-CoV-2 infections could potentially be detected prior to symptom onset.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Scott Sherrill-Mix","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20149013","rel_title":"The Age Pattern of the Male- to- Female Ratio in Mortality from COVID-19 Mirrors that of Cardiovascular Disease but not Cancer in the General Population","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20149013","rel_abs":"Background: Males are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Older age and cardiovascular disease are also associated with COVID-19 mortality. We compared the male-to-female (sex) ratios in mortality by age for COVID-19 with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality in the general population. Methods: We obtained data from official government sources in the US and five European countries: Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. We analyzed COVID-19 deaths by sex and age in these countries and similarly analyzed their deaths from cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke) and cancer, the two leading age-related causes of death in middle-to-high income countries. Findings: In both the US and European countries, the sex ratio of deaths from COVID-19 exceeded one throughout adult life. The sex ratio increased up to a peak in midlife, and then declined markedly in later life. This pattern was also observed for the sex ratio of deaths from cardiovascular disease, but not cancer, in the general populations of the US and European countries. Interpretation: The sex ratios of deaths from COVID-19 and from cardiovascular disease exhibit similar patterns across the adult life course. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but could stem partially from sex-related biological differences that underlie the similar pattern for cardiovascular disease. These include, we propose, comparatively longer telomeres in females, ovarian hormones, and X chromosome mosaicism.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ila Nimgaonkar","author_inst":"Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School"},{"author_name":"Linda Valeri","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ezra S.

This study offers an exhaustive analysis of the reproductive number (R0) in India with major intervention for COVID-19 outbreaks and analysed the lockdown effects on the Covid-19. Methodology: Covid-19 data extracted from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Then, a novel method implemented in the incidence and Optimum function in desolve package to the data of cumulative daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the reproduction number in the R software. Result: Analysis has been seen that the lockdown was really quite as effective, India has already shown a major steady decline. The growth rate has fluctuated about 20 percent with trend line projections in various lockdown. A comparative analysis gives an idea of decline in value of R0 from 1.73 to 1.08. Annotation plot showing the predicted R0 values based on previous lockdown in month of June and July. Conclusion: Without lockdown, the growth might not have been contained in India and may have gone into the exponential zone. We show that, the lockdown in India was fairly successful. The effect partial lifting of the lockdown (unlock) is also seen in the results, in terms of increment in R0 values. Hence this study provides a platform for policy makers and government authorities for implementing the strategies to prevent the spread of infection.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayank Chhabra","author_inst":"IIHMR UniversityJaipur"},{"author_name":"Tushant Agrawal","author_inst":"Amity University Rajasthan"},{"author_name":"Konstantina Kontogianni","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lottie Brown","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrea M Collins","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniela Ferreira","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alice J Fraser","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gala Garrod","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Hill","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Menzies","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elena Mitsi","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sophie I Owen","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T Williams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angela Hyder-Wright","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149971","rel_title":"In vivo demonstration of microvascular thrombosis in severe Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20149971","rel_abs":"Several autopsies studies showed the presence of microthrombi in the pulmonary circulation of the severe COVID-19.

However, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the association between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 1425 COVID-19 patients who had pre-diagnostic serum IGF-1 measurements at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: COVID-19 mortality (available death data updated to 22 May 2020). Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality across the IGF-1 quartiles. Results: Among 1425 COVID-19 patients, 365 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. Compared to the lowest quartile of IGF-1 concentrations, the highest quartile was associated with a 37% lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.93, P-trend=0.03). The association was stronger in women and nonsmokers (both P-interaction=0.01). Conclusions: Higher IGF-1 concentrations are associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality. Further studies are required to determine whether and how targeting IGF-1 pathway might improve COVID-19 prognosis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xikang Fan","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Yin","author_inst":"Jiangning Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Wang","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mingjia Yang","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hongxia Ma","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guangfu Jin","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mingyang Song","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

A crucial role in epidemics is played by the number of undetected infective individuals who continue to circulate and spread the disease. Epidemiological investigations and mathematical models have revealed that the rapid diffusion of Covid-19 can mostly be attributed to the large percentage of undocumented infective individuals who escape testing. Methods. The dynamics of an infection can be described by the SIR model, which divides the population into susceptible (S), infective (I) and removed (R) subjects. In particular, we exploited the Kermack and McKendrick epidemic model which can be applied when the population is much larger than the fraction of infected subjects. Results. We proved that the fraction of undocumented infectives, in comparison to the total number of infected subjects, is given by 1-1\/R0 , where R0 is the basic reproduction number. The mean value R0=2.10 (2.09-2.11) in three Italian regions for the Covid-19 epidemic yielded a percentage of undetected infectives of 52.4% (52.2% - 52.6%) compared to the total number of infectives. Conclusions. Our results, straightforwardly obtained from the SIR model, highlight the role played by undetected carriers in the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such evidence strongly recommends careful monitoring of the infective population and ongoing adjustment of preventive measures for disease control until a vaccine becomes available.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maurizio Melis","author_inst":"AART (Association for the Advancement of Research on Transplantation), Cagliari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Littera","author_inst":"Complex Structure of Medical Genetics, R.

While recent reports showed increased distress and depressive\/anxiety state related to COVID-19 crisis, we investigated how home quarantine affected sleep parameters in healthy individuals. Methods 160 healthy individuals who were in home quarantine in April 2020 for at least one month participated in this study. Participants rated and compared their quantitative sleep parameters (time to go to bed, sleep duration, getting-up time) and sleep quality factors, pre-and during home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, participants chronotype was determined to see if sleep parameters are differentially affected in different chronotypes. Results The time to fall asleep and get-up in the morning were significantly delayed in all participants, indicating a significant circadian misalignment. Sleep quality was reported to be significantly poorer in all participants and chronotypes, and included more daily disturbances (more sleep disturbances, higher daily dysfunctions due to low quality of sleep) and less perceived sleep quality (lower subjective sleep quality, longer time taken to fall asleep at night, more use of sleep medication for improving sleep quality) during home quarantine. Conclusions Home quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental impact on sleep quality. Online interventions including self-help sleep programs, stress management, relaxation practices, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness training are available interventions in the current situation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Salehinejad","author_inst":"Department of Psychology and Neurosciences, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors"},{"author_name":"Maryam Majidinezhad","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Elham Ghanavati","author_inst":"Ruhr-University Bochum, Department of Psychology, Bochum, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sahar Kouestanian","author_inst":"Institute for Cognitive Science Studies, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Carmelo M.

The need to include migrants (both regular and irregular or undocumented) in national strategic response plans for disease prevention and control has been increasingly recognized. Better understanding of the existing scientific evidence in migration health is crucial in designing effective response measures. In this paper, we present a protocol for a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. Expected study findings aim to provide valuable information to support evidence mapping on COVID-19 and migration health, particularly the identification of important research gaps. Methods and analysis: Using Elseviers Scopus abstract and citation database, a comprehensive search strategy will be applied to map scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. The current analysis will focus on research published from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. The search query on migration health will largely focus on migration, migrant and human mobility-related terms. Three reviewers will screen publications for eligibility. The extracted bibliographic information will be analysed to determine the dominant research themes, country coverage and migrant groups.

In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, ReCoNet (residual image-based COVID-19 detection network), is proposed for COVID-19 detection. This is achieved from chest X-ray (CXR) images shedding light on the preprocessing task considered to be very useful for enhancing the COVID-19 fingerprints. The proposed modular architecture consists of a CNN-based multi-level preprocessing filter block in cascade with a multi-layer CNN-based feature extractor and a classification block. A multi-task learning loss function is adopted for optimization of the preprocessing block trained end-to-end with the rest of the proposed network. Additionally, a data augmentation technique is applied for boosting the network performance. The whole network when pre-trained end-to-end on the CheXpert open source dataset, and trained and tested with the COVIDx dataset of 15,134 original CXR images yielded an overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.48%, 96.39%, and 97.53%, respectively. The immense potential of ReCoNet may be exploited in clinics for rapid and safe detection of COVID-19 globally, in particular in the low and middle income countries where RT-PCR labs and\/or kits are in a serious crisis.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabbir Ahmed","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology"},{"author_name":"Moi Hoon Yap","author_inst":"Manchester Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Maxine Tan","author_inst":"Monash University Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Md.

In response, the Government has claimed that lockdown slowed the transmission process of COVID, thereby reducing the number of cases and deaths substantially. The consequent pressure on the health infrastructure was also much less. To judge between competing claims, this study has undertaken the first cost-benefit analysis of the worlds biggest lockdown. Although the data for a proper cost-benefit analysis is currently not available, we have made a ball point estimate of the net benefit of the lockdown under alternative scenarios.

This paper defines the term lockdown and describes the design, timing and implementation of lockdown in nine countries in Sub Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It also discusses the manner in which lockdown is enforced, the need to mitigate the harms of lockdown, and the association between lockdown and the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While there are some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown, a more notable finding is the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures across the nine countries. We found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests done, and that testing rates ranged from 9 to 21,261 per million population. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies, but is generally low when compared to countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit some community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. Of concern are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic harms. This paper highlights the need for inter-sectoral and trans-disciplinary research capable of providing a rigorous and holistic assessment of the harms and benefits of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Najmul Haider","author_inst":"The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL9 7TA, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdinasir Yusuf Osman","author_inst":"The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL9 7TA, UK"},{"author_name":"Audrey Gadzekpo","author_inst":"University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana"},{"author_name":"George O.

However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. Aim To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. Methods Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work and ethnicity. Analysis was performed using Microsoft ExcelTM. Findings COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-white ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical Care had lower rates than the Emergency Department (ED), but rates in the ED declined once all staff were advised to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Conclusion These findings show that sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. The results also suggest that current PPE is effective when used appropriately. In addition, our findings emphasise the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.

However, the missing asymptomatic cases have been significantly overlooked because of imperfect sensitivity of nucleic acid testing. We aimed to investigate the humoral immunity in asymptomatics, which will help us develop serological tests and improve early identification, understand the humoral immunity to COVID-19, and provide more rational control strategies for the pandemic. Objective To better control the pandemic of COVID-19, dynamics of IgM and IgG responses to 23 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibody in asymptomatic COVID-19 infections after exposure time were investigated. Design, setting, and participants 63 asymptomatic individuals were screened by RT-qPCR and ELISA for IgM and IgG from 11,776 personnel returning to work, and close contacts with the confirmed cases in different communities of Wuhan by investigation of clusters and tracing infectious sources. 63 healthy contacts with both negative results for NAT and antibodies were selected as negative controls. 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were also screened as controls from 1056 patients during hospitalization in Tongji Hospital. A total of 177 participants were enrolled in this study and serial serum samples (n=213) were collected. The research was conducted between 17 February 2020 and 28 April 2020. Serum IgM and IgG profiles of 177 participants were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray. Neutralizing antibody responses in different population were detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. Results Asymptomatics were classified into four subgroups based on NAT and serological tests. In particular, only 19% had positive NAT results while approximately 81% detected positive IgM\/IgG responses. Comparative SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray further demonstrated that there was a significantly difference of antibody dynamics responding to S1 or N proteins among three populations, although IgM and IgG profiles could not be used to differentiate them. S1 specific IgM responses were elicited in asymptomatic individuals as early to the seventh day after exposure and peaked on days from 17d to 25d, which might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker and give an additional 36.5% seropositivity. Mild patients produced stronger both S1 specific IgM and neutralizing antibody responses than asymptomatic individuals. Most importantly, S1 specific IgM\/IgG responses and the titers of neutralizing antibody in asymptomatic individuals gradually vanished in two months. Conclusions and relevance Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health and immunization strategies.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qing Lei","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Hou","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yandi Zhang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Danyun Lai","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Banga Ndzouboukou Jo-Lewis","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Zhuqing Ouyang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Junbiao Xue","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaosong Lin","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunxiao Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Zhongjie Yao","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuening Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Caizheng Yu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Hainan Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shujuan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shenghai Huang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ziyong Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Xionglin Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20148429","rel_title":"Longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20148429","rel_abs":"Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (>10,000) maintained titres >1,000 at >60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey Seow","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carl Graham","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Blair Merrick","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Acors","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn J.A.

The age-related susceptibility is partly explained by increased comorbidities including dementia and type II diabetes. While it is unclear why these diseases predispose risk, we hypothesize that increased biological age, rather than chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity with age. To test this hypothesis, we applied our previously validated biological age measure (PhenoAge) composed of chronological age and nine clinical chemistry biomarkers to data of 347,751 participants from a large community cohort in the United Kingdom (UK Biobank), recruited between 2006 and 2010. Other data included disease diagnoses (to 2017), mortality data (to 2020), and the UK national COVID-19 test results (to May 31, 2020). Accelerated aging 10-14 years prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with test positivity (OR=1.15 per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.21, p=3.2x10-6) and all-cause mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR=1.25, per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.44, p=0.002) after adjustment for demographics including current chronological age and pre-existing diseases or conditions. The corresponding areas under the curves were 0.669 and 0.803, respectively. Biological aging, as captured by PhenoAge, is a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than chronological age, and may inform risk stratification initiatives, while also elucidating possible underlying mechanisms, particularly those related to inflammaging.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chia-Ling Kuo","author_inst":"University of Connecticu Health"},{"author_name":"Luke C Pilling","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Janice C Atkins","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Jane Masoli","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Joao Delgado","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Christopher Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"George Kuchel","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Beckman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Betancor","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Harry D Wilson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Adrian W Signell","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Helena Winstone","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Kerridge","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Luke Snell","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Amelia Moore","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian Green","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Lauren Martinez","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Brielle Stokes","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Johanna Honey","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Alba Izquierdo-Barras","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Gill Arbane","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Amita Patel","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorcan OConnell","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Gaia Nebbia","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust"},{"author_name":"Rocio Martinez-Nunez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D.

Objective: We evaluated the prevalence of HELLP-like signs in pregnant women admitted for COVID-19 and the value of angiogenic factors to rule out preeclampsia. Methods: a consecutive series of 27 pregnant women beyond 20 weeks of gestation, with symptomatic COVID-19. Clinical and analytical features were recorded and those cases with signs of HELLP syndrome were tested for sFlt-1\/PlGF ratio. Results: Seven patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome, of which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and high transaminases and 5 (18.5%) had only elevated transaminases. sFlt-1\/PlGF ratio was normal in 6 of 7. Conclusion: Symptomatic COVID-19 may simulate severe preeclampsia in pregnancy. Angiogenic factors may be essential to avoid false diagnosis and needless interventions.

The standard diagnostic pipeline for testing SARS-CoV-2 presence in patients with an ongoing infection is predominantly based on pharyngeal swabs, from which the viral RNA is extracted using commercial kits followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. As a result of the large demand for testing, commercial RNA extraction kits may be limited and alternative, non-commercial protocols are needed. Here, we provide a magnetic bead RNA extraction protocol that is predominantly based on in-house made reagents and is performed in 96-well plates supporting large-scale testing. Magnetic bead RNA extraction was benchmarked against the commercial QIAcube extraction platform. Comparable viral RNA detection sensitivity and specificity were obtained by fluorescent and colorimetric RT-LAMP using N primers, as well as RT-qPCR using E gene primers showing that the here presented RNA extraction protocol can be combined with a variety of detection methods at high throughput. Importantly, the presented diagnostic workflow can be quickly set up in a laboratory without access to an automated pipetting robot.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen Klein","author_inst":"Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thorsten G.

Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay serves as a surrogate neutralization assay and is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against the RBD, enabling a direct comparison. The results obtained with our assay correlate with those of two viral based assays, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that uses live SARS-CoV-2 virus, and a spike pseudotyped viral-vector-based assay.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kento T Abe","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mt Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Reuben Samson","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emelissa J Valcourt","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Heidi Wood","author_inst":"National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alan P.

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAuthor ContributionsCH performed research, analyzed data, and wrote the paper; CS performed research and analyzed data; AA performed research and analyzed data; AE performed research and analyzed data; SM performed research, analyzed data, and wrote the paper; MH developed the bioinformatics pipeline and analyzed data; BS contributed new reagents and concepts; MDM designed and supervised research, analyzed data and wrote the paper; all authors read, corrected and approved the final manuscript.\n\nSignificance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cindy Hoerner","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Christoph Schuermann","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Arne Auste","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Aileen Ebenig","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Samada Muraleedharan","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Maike Herrmann","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Barbara Schnierle","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Michael D Muehlebach","author_inst":"Paul-Ehrlich-Institut"},{"author_name":"Roxie C Girardin","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Bhavisha Rathod","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Karen Colwill","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Allison J.

This current poses great challenges to hemodialysis (HD) patients. Objective: To make a comprehensive evaluation and comparison between HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 and the general HD patients. Methods: HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Wuhan No.5 Hospital were admitted as confirmed group from Jan 10 to Mar 15, 2020. And HD patients not infected in our dialysis center were chosen as control group. General characteristics, laboratory indicators were retrospectively collected, analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 142 cases were admitted, including 43 cases in confirmed group and 99 in control group. Body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower in confirmed group than that in control group (P=0.011). The proportion of one or less underlying disease in confirmed group(51.16%) was higher than that in control group(14.14%)(P< 0.001), and the proportion of three or more underlying diseases in confirmed group(11.63%) was lower than that in control group(52.53%)(P< 0.001). Patients in confirmed group exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage, but higher neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. There was no significant difference in age, gender, dialysis age, primary disease, the using of ACEI\/ARB, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) , and other indicators between the two groups. Conclusions: Faced with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), HD patients with lower BMI and hemoglobin were more susceptible to be infected, which might be related to malnutrition. Once confirmed with COVID-19, HD patients expressed obviously disregulated in inflammation and immune.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofen Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Tan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Yong He","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Guosheng Yang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Mingmei Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Duan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Han","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Kuang","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China"},{"author_name":"Samira Mubareka","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L.

Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. We compare PICTURE to the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a widespread system which has recently been assessed for use to triage COVID-19 patients. Methods The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to the EDI for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death) at two levels of granularity: (1) maximum score across an encounter with a minimum lead time before the first adverse event and (2) predictions at every observation with instances in the last 24 hours before the adverse event labeled as positive. PICTURE and the EDI were also compared on the encounter level using different lead times extending out to 24 hours. Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. Results PICTURE successfully delineated between high- and low-risk patients and consistently outperformed the EDI in both of our cohorts. In non-COVID-19 patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) and AUPRC of 0.109 (0.089 - 0.125) on the observation level, compared to the EDI AUROC of 0.762 (0.746 - 0.780) and AUPRC of 0.077 (0.062 - 0.090). On COVID-19 positive patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC of 0.828 (0.794 - 0.869) and AUPRC of 0.160 (0.089 - 0.199), while the EDI scored an AUROC of 0.792 (0.754 - 0.835) and AUPRC of 0.131 (0.092 - 0.159). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). Conclusion The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering a potential incipient second wave of COVID-19 infections. PICTURE also has the ability to explain individual predictions to clinicians by ranking the most important features for a prediction. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brandon C Cummings","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sardar Ansari","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R Motyka","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Guan Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Richard P Medlin Jr.","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Steven L Kronick","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Karandeep Singh","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pauline K Park","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lena M Napolitano","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robert P Dickson","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael R Mathis","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael W Sjoding","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Admon","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kevin R Ward","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher E Gillies","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mario Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A McDonough","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Michael A.

Around 8 millions of individuals previously got influenced by novel coronavirus and it causes at any rate 500,000 deaths. There are just about 90,000 individuals contaminated by COVID-19 in Bangladesh too. As it is an exceptionally new pandemic infection, its diagnosis is challenging for the medical community. In regular cases, it is hard for lower incoming countries to test cases easily. RT-PCR test is the most generally utilized analysis framework for COVID-19 patient detection. However, by utilizing X-ray image based programmed recognition can diminish the expense and testing time. So according to handling this test, it is important to program and effective recognition to forestall transmission to others. In this paper, we attempt to distinguish COVID-19 patients by chest X-ray images. We execute different pre-trained deep neural system models, for example, Sequential, DenseNet121, ResNet152 and EfficientNetB4 to assess the most productive outcome. And aims to utilize transfer-based learning. We assess this outcome by AUC, where EfficientNetB4 has 0.997 AUC, ResNet50 has 0.967 AUC, DenseNet121 has 0.874 AUC and the Sequential model has 0.762 AUC individually.

We investigated seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein aligned with PCR results that confirmed previous infection. Anti-spike IgG titers remained high 60 days post-infection and did not associate with symptoms, but spike-specific IgM did associate with malaise and fever. We found limited household transmission, with children of infected individuals seldomly seropositive, highlighting professional exposure as the dominant route of infection in our cohort. We analyzed PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist- activation revealed an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1{beta}+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicited IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlated with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects, and was likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33- producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 revealed a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with disease. Together these findings show that IL-33 production is linked to SARS-CoV- 2 infection and warrant further investigation of IL-33 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michal A Stanczak","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"David E Sanin","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"Petya Apostolova","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Nerz","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Lampaki","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"Maike Hofmann","author_inst":"University Hospital Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Daniel Steinmann","author_inst":"Medical Center - University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Robert Thimme","author_inst":"University Hospital Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Gerhard Mittler","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"Cornelius F Waller","author_inst":"Medical Center - University of Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Edward J Pearce","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"Erika L Pearce","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology and Epigenetics"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Admon","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kevin R Ward","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher E Gillies","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mario Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A McDonough","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Michael A.

Objectives: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients and explore factors associated with hospitalization risk by race. Methods: Case series of 448 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA), an integrated health care system serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, from March 3 to May 12, 2020. KPGA members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Multivariable analyses for hospitalization risk also included an additional 3489 persons under investigation (PUI) with suspected infection. COVID-19 treatment and outcomes, underlying comorbidities and quality of care management metrics, socio-demographic and other individual and community-level social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators. Results: Of 448 COVID-19 positive members, 68,3% was non-Hispanic Black (n=306), 18% non-Hispanic White (n=81) and 13,7% Other race (n=61). Median age was 54 [IQR 43-63) years. Overall, 224 patients were hospitalized, median age 60 (50-69) years. Black race was a significant factor in the Confirmed + PUI, female and male models (ORs from 1.98 to 2.19). Obesity was associated with higher hospitalization odds in the confirmed, confirmed + PUI, Black and male models (ORs from 1.78 to 2.77). Chronic disease control metrics (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) were associated with lower odds of hospitalization ranging from 48% to 35% in the confirmed + PUI and Black models. Self-reported physical inactivity was associated with 50% higher hospitalization odds in the Black and Female models. Residence in the Northeast region of Atlanta was associated with lower hospitalization odds in the Confirmed + PUI, White and female models (ORs from 0.22 to 0.64) Conclusions: We found that non-Hispanic Black KPGA members had a disproportionately higher risk of infection and, after adjusting for covariates, twice the risk of hospitalization compared to other race groups. We found no significant differences in clinical outcomes or mortality across race\/ethnicity groups. In addition to age, sex and comorbidity burden, pre-pandemic self-reported exercise, metrics on quality of care and control of underlying cardio-metabolic diseases, and location of residence in Atlanta were significantly associated with hospitalization risk by race groups. Beyond well-known physiologic and clinical factors, individual and community-level social indicators and health behaviors must be considered as interventions designed to reduce COVID-19 disparities and the systemic effects of racism are implemented.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe Lobelo","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Georgia"},{"author_name":"Alan X Bienvenida","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group"},{"author_name":"Serena Leung","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group"},{"author_name":"Armand N Mbanya","author_inst":"The Southeast Permanente Medical Group"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J.
