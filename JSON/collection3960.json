The patients demonstrate a great diversity in clinical and laboratory manifestations and disease severity. Nonetheless, little is known about the host genetic contribution to the observed inter-individual phenotypic variability. Here, we report the first host genetic study in China by deeply sequencing and analyzing the 332 COVID-19 patients categorized by varying levels of severity from the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital. Based on a total of 22.2 million genetic variants, we conducted both single-variant and gene-based association tests among the five severity groups including asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical ill patients after the correction of potential confounding factors. The most significant gene loci associated with severity is located in TMEM189-UBE2V1 involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway. The p.Val197Met missense variant that affects the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein displays a decreasing allele frequency among the severe patients compared to the mild and the general population. We also identified that the HLA-A*11:01, B*51:01 and C*14:02 alleles significantly predispose the worst outcome of the patients. This initial study of Chinese patients provides a comprehensive view of the genetic difference among the COVID-19 patient groups and highlighted genes and variants that may help guide targeted efforts in containing the outbreak. Limitations and advantages of the study were also reviewed to guide future international efforts on elucidating the genetic architecture of host-pathogen interaction for COVID-19 and other infectious and complex diseases.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fang Wang","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shujia Huang","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huirong Gao","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yuwen Zhou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Changxiang Lai","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Xian","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Qian","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhiyu Li","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yushan Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Qiyuan Tang","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Panhong Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ruikun Chen","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Rong Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Tong Xin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhou Xuan","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yong Bai","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Gang Duan","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Siyang Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20125690","rel_title":"Proteomic Profiling in Biracial Cohorts Implicates DC-SIGN as a Mediator of Genetic Risk in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20125690","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is one of the most consequential pandemics in the last century, yet the biological mechanisms that confer disease risk are incompletely understood. Further, heterogeneity in disease outcomes is influenced by race, though the relative contributions of structural\/social and genetic factors remain unclear. Very recent unpublished work has identified two genetic risk loci that confer greater risk for respiratory failure in COVID-19: the ABO locus and the 3p21.31 locus. To understand how these loci might confer risk and whether this differs by race, we utilized proteomic profiling and genetic information from three cohorts including black and white participants to identify proteins influenced by these loci. We observed that variants in the ABO locus are associated with levels of CD209\/DC-SIGN, a known binding protein for SARS-CoV and other viruses, as well as multiple inflammatory and thrombotic proteins, while the 3p21.31 locus is associated with levels of CXCL16, a known inflammatory chemokine. Thus, integration of genetic information and proteomic profiling in biracial cohorts highlights putative mechanisms for genetic risk in COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel H.

Here, we formulate agent-based models that simulate the spread of a respiratory infectious disease in a train wagon in the Manila Light Rail Transit System, and in a 49-seater public utility bus. We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing, and limitation of interaction or movement among the commuters to investigate how these measures will inhibit disease transmission. We also consider the effect of protective gears and practices, crowd density, and prevalence of disease in the community on the possible number of newly-infected individuals. Our simulations show that (i) individuals must have protection with more than 90% effectiveness to inhibit transmission of the disease; (ii) social or physical distancing by more than 1m distance reduces the risk of being infected; (iii) minimizing movement or interaction with other passengers reduces the risk of transmission by 50%; (iv) passenger capacity should be less than 10-50% of the maximum seating capacity to reduce the number of infections depending on the level of imposed social distancing and passenger interaction; (v) vehicles with greater number of occupied seating capacity generate higher number of infections but vehicles with smaller dimensions have faster disease transmissions; and (vi) ideal set-up for a 24-seater train wagon (49-seater bus) is to allow a maximum of 12 (24) passengers, with little to no interaction among passengers, with social distancing of more than 1m distance apart, and each person has a protection with 90% effectiveness as much as possible. These results can aid policy makers in determining optimal strategies to minimize infections while maintaining transportation services during pandemics or disease outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Alvin H Buhat","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Destiny SM Lutero","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Yancee H Olave","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Monica C Torres","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Akhil Pampana","author_inst":"Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT"},{"author_name":"Yan Gao","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michelle J.

An accurate estimate of this fraction is crucial for the assessment of the situation and the establishment of protective measures. In most current studies using epidemics models, the total number of infected is either approximated by the number of diagnosed individuals or is dependent on the model parameters and assumptions, which are often debated. We here study the relationship between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We show that those two are approximately the same in exponential models and across most models currently used in the study of epidemics, independently of the model parameters. As an application, we compute an estimate of the effective number of infected by the COVID-19 virus in Israel.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akiva B Melka","author_inst":"Bar Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Yoram Louzoun","author_inst":"Bar Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Yancee H Olave","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Monica C Torres","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Akhil Pampana","author_inst":"Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT"},{"author_name":"Yan Gao","author_inst":"University of Mississippi Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michelle J.

How We Feel collects longitudinal and geographically localized information on users' health, behavior, and demographics. Here we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from April 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020. We show that self- reported surveys can be used to build predictive models of COVID-19 test results, which may aid in identification of likely COVID-19 positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation, as well as for household and community exposure, occupation, and demographics being strong risk factors for COVID-19. We further reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested, as well as the temporal dynamics of self- reported symptoms and self-isolation behavior in positive and negative users.

Aims We investigated whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. Methods 502,640 participants aged 40-69 years at baseline (54-79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK 2006-10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried's classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16\/03\/2020-01\/06\/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Results 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive=1,326, negative=3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR=1.3 [95% CI=1.1, 1.7]), report slow walking speed (OR=1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR=1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid ([&ge;]4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR=1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Furthermore, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COIVD-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. Discussion and conclusions Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of a positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S J Woolford","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"S D'angelo","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"E M Curtis","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C M Parsons","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"K A Ward","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"E M Dennison","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"H P Patel","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C Cooper","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"N C Harvey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Albert Pereta","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Chris Danford","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Amine Kamel","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Patrik Gothe","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evrhet Milam","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Jean Aurambault","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Thorben Primke","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Claire Li","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Josh Inkenbrandt","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Tuan Huynh","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evan Chen","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Christina Lee","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Michael Croatto","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Helen Bentley","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Wendy Lu","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Robert Murray","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Mark Travassos","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Openshaw","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Brent Coull","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Casey Greene","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ophir Shalem","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Probasco","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"David Cheng","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Ben Silbermann","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Harvard University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126128","rel_title":"Poorly known aspects of flattening the curve of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126128","rel_abs":"This work concerns the too-often mentioned flattening of the curve of COVID-19.

A negative correlation observed between the final number of infections and the slope of the logistic curve corroborates a result obtained long time ago via an extensive simulation study. There is both theoretical arguments and experimental evidence for the existence of such correlations. The flattening of the curve results in a retardation of the curve's midpoint, which entails an increase in the final number of infections. It is possible that more lives are lost at the end by this process. Our analysis also permits evaluation of the various governments' interventions in terms of rapidity of response, efficiency of the actions taken (the amount of flattening achieved), and the number of days by which the curve was delayed.

Here we present methods for estimating force of infection from serological surveys of infections which produce lasting immunity, taking into account imperfections in the test used, and uncertainty in such imperfections. The methods cover both single serological surveys, in which age is a proxy for time at risk, and repeat surveys in the same people, in which the force of infection is estimated more directly. Fixed values can be used for the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, or existing methods for belief elicitation can be used to include uncertainty in these values. The latter may be applicable, for example, when the specificity of a test depends on co-circulating pathogens, which may not have been well characterized in the setting of interest. We illustrate the methods using data from two published serological studies of dengue.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neal Alexander","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mabel Carabali","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Kyungah Lim","author_inst":"Global Dengue and Aedes-transmitted Diseases Consortium (GDAC), International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"C M Parsons","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"K A Ward","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"E M Dennison","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"H P Patel","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"C Cooper","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"N C Harvey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Albert Pereta","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Chris Danford","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Amine Kamel","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Patrik Gothe","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evrhet Milam","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Jean Aurambault","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Thorben Primke","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Claire Li","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Josh Inkenbrandt","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Tuan Huynh","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evan Chen","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Christina Lee","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Michael Croatto","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Helen Bentley","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Wendy Lu","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Robert Murray","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Mark Travassos","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Openshaw","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Brent Coull","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Casey Greene","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ophir Shalem","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Probasco","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"David Cheng","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Ben Silbermann","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Harvard University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20125831","rel_title":"Estimation of effects of contact tracing and mask adoption on COVID-19 transmission in San Francisco: a modeling study","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20125831","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has spurred concern about what interventions may be effective at reducing transmission. The city and county of San Francisco imposed a shelter-in-place order in March 2020, followed by use of a contact tracing program and a policy requiring use of cloth face masks. We used statistical estimation and simulation to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions in San Francisco. We estimated that self-isolation and other practices beginning at the time of San Francisco's shelter-in-place order reduced the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 by 35.4% (95% CI, -20.1%--81.4%). We estimated the effect of contact tracing on the effective reproduction number to be a reduction of approximately 44% times the fraction of cases that are detected, which may be modest if the detection rate is low. We estimated the impact of cloth mask adoption on reproduction number to be approximately 8.6%, and note that the benefit of mask adoption may be substantially greater for essential workers and other vulnerable populations, residents return to circulating outside the home more often. We estimated the effect of those interventions on incidence by simulating counterfactual scenarios in which contact tracing was not adopted, cloth masks were not adopted, and neither contact tracing nor cloth masks was adopted, and found increases in case counts that were modest, but relatively larger than the effects on reproduction numbers. These estimates and model results suggest that testing coverage and timing of testing and contact tracing may be important, and that modest effects on reproduction numbers can nonetheless cause substantial effects on case counts over time.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lee Worden","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Rae Wannier","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Seth Blumberg","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alex Y.

This study examined trajectories of depressive symptoms (DST) over time among vulnerable individuals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample consisted of 51,417 adults recruited from the COVID-19 Social Study. Depressive symptoms were measured on seven occasions (21st March - 2nd April), using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic vulnerabilities included non-white ethnic background, low socio-economic position (SEP), and type of work (keyworker versus no keyworker). Health-related and psychosocial vulnerabilities included pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological and\/or physical abuse, and low social support. Group-based DST were derived using latent growth mixture modelling and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the association between these vulnerabilities and DSTs. Model estimates were adjusted for age, sex, and suspected COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Three DSTs were identified: low [N=30,850 (60%)] moderate [N=14,911 (29%)], and severe [N=5,656 (11%)] depressive symptoms. DSTs were relatively stable across the first 6 weeks of lockdown. After adjusting for covariates, experiences of physical\/psychological abuse (OR 13.16, 95% CI 12.95-13.37), pre-existing mental health conditions (OR 13.00 95% CI 12.87-13.109), pre-existing physical health conditions (OR 3.41, 95% CI 3.29-3.54), low social support (OR 12.72, 95% CI 12.57-12.86), and low SEP (OR 5.22, 95% CI 5.08-5.36) were significantly associated with the severe DST. No significant association was found for ethnicity (OR 1.07, 95% 0.85-1.28). Participants with key worker roles were less likely to experience severe depressive symptoms (OR 0.66, 95% 0.53-0.80). Similar but smaller patterns of associations were found for the moderate DST. Conclusions: People with psychosocial and health-related risk factors, as well as those with low SEP seem to be most vulnerable to experiencing moderate or severe depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philipp Frank","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Iob","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"George W.

Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates the host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans, and the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spikes receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2 recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift towards the \"down\" state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be exploited by therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational plasticity of the RBD that could be harnessed for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lorenzo Casalino","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Zied Gaieb","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jory Goldsmith","author_inst":"University of Texas"},{"author_name":"Christy K.

These are used as controls, and allow measurement and improvement of the accuracy and quality of diagnostic tests. Current reference standards typically represent target genetic material, and act only as positive controls to assess test sensitivity. However, negative controls are also required to evaluate test specificity. Using a pair of chimeric A\/B RNA standards, this allowed incorporation of positive and negative controls into diagnostic testing for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The chimeric standards constituted target regions for RT-PCR primer\/probe sets that are joined in tandem across two separate synthetic molecules. Accordingly, a target region that is present in standard A provides a positive control, whilst being absent in standard B, thereby providing a negative control. This design enables cross-validation of positive and negative controls between the paired standards in the same reaction, with identical conditions. This enables control and test failures to be distinguished, increasing confidence in the accuracy of results. The chimeric A\/B standards were assessed using the US Centers for Disease Control real-time RT-PCR protocol, and showed results congruent with other commercial controls in detecting SARS CoV-2 in patient samples. This chimeric reference standard design approach offers extensive flexibility, allowing representation of diverse genetic features and distantly related sequences, even from different organisms.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bindu Swapna Madala","author_inst":"Garvan Institute of Medical Research, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"Andre L.

In the light of the urgent need to identify novel approaches to be used in the emergency phase, a largely explored strategy has been the repurpose of clinically available drugs as new antivirals, by targeting different viral proteins. In this paper, we describe a drug repurposing strategy based on a virtual screening of druggable pockets located in the central \u03b2-sheet core of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD supported by in vitro tests identifying several steroidal derivatives as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that several potential binding sites exist in the SARS CoV-2 S protein, and that the occupancy of these pockets reduces the ability of the S protein RBD to bind to the ACE2 consensus in vitro. In particular, natural occurring and clinically available steroids as glycyrrhetinic and oleanolic acids, as well as the bile acids derivatives glyco-UDCA and obeticholic acid have been shown to be effective in preventing virus entry in the case of low viral load. All together, these results might help to define novel approaches to reduce the viral load by using SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors.Competing Interest StatementThis paper was supported by a research grant by BAR Pharmaceuticals S.r.L. to the Department of Pharmacy of the University of Napoli Federico II and to the Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Perugia.\nThe authors declare the following competing financial interest(s): S.F., A.Z. and B.C. have filed an Italian patent application no.102020000011092 in the name of BAR Pharmaceuticals S.r.L. on the compounds described in this paper.\nView Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adriana Carino","author_inst":"University of Perugia, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Moraca","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bianca Fiorillo","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Marcan\u00f3","author_inst":"University of Perugia, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Valentina Sepe","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Biagioli","author_inst":"University of Perugia, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Finamore","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bozza","author_inst":"University of Perugia, Department of Medicine, Microbiology Section, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniela Francisci","author_inst":"University of Perugia, Department of Medicine, Microbiology Section, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Distrutti","author_inst":"SC di Gastroenterologia ed Epatologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruno Catalanotti","author_inst":"University of Napoli Federico II"},{"author_name":"Angela Zampella","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fiorucci","author_inst":"University of Perugia, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Evrhet Milam","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Jean Aurambault","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Thorben Primke","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Claire Li","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Josh Inkenbrandt","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Tuan Huynh","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Evan Chen","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Christina Lee","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Michael Croatto","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Helen Bentley","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Wendy Lu","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Robert Murray","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Mark Travassos","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Openshaw","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Brent Coull","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Casey Greene","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ophir Shalem","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Probasco","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"David Cheng","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Ben Silbermann","author_inst":"The How We Feel Project"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Xihong Lin","author_inst":"Harvard University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"pharmacology and toxicology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.145086","rel_title":"Investigation of the effect of temperature on the structure of SARS-Cov-2 Spike Protein by Molecular Dynamics Simulations","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.145086","rel_abs":"Statistical and epidemiological data imply temperature sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. However, the molecular level understanding of the virus structure at different temperature is still not clear. Spike protein is the outermost structural protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which interacts with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a human receptor, and enters the respiratory system. In this study, we performed an all atom molecular dynamics simulation to study the effect of temperature on the structure of the Spike protein. After 200ns of simulation at different temperatures, we came across some interesting phenomena exhibited by the protein. We found that the solvent exposed domain of Spike protein, namely S1, is more mobile than the transmembrane domain, S2. Structural studies implied the presence of several charged residues on the surface of N-terminal Domain of S1 which are optimally oriented at 10-30 {degrees}C. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that it is capable of binding to other human receptors and should not be disregarded. Additionally, we found that receptor binding motif (RBM), present on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1, begins to close around temperature of 40 {degrees}C and attains a completely closed conformation at 50 {degrees}C. The closed conformation disables its ability to bind to ACE2, due to the burying of its receptor binding residues. Our results clearly show that there are active and inactive states of the protein at different temperatures. This would not only prove beneficial for understanding the fundamental nature of the virus, but would be also useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/145086v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e631eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d83278org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d98d3borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c75b7f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIStatistical and epidemiological evidence show that external climatic conditions influence the SARS-CoV infectivity, but we still lack a molecular level understanding of the same.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we study the influence of temperature on the structure of the Spike glycoprotein, the outermost structural protein, of the virus which binds to the human receptor ACE2.\nC_LIO_LIResults show that the Spikes S1 domain is very sensitive to external atmospheric conditions compared to the S2 transmembrane domain.\nC_LIO_LIThe N-terminal domain comprises of several solvent exposed charged residues that are capable of binding to human proteins.

Although many human clinical trials are ongoing, there remains a deficiency of supportive preclinical drug efficacy studies. Here we assessed the prophylactic\/therapeutic efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a drug of interest for COVID-19 management, in two animal models. When used for prophylaxis or treatment neither the standard human malaria dose (6.5 mg\/kg) nor a high dose (50 mg\/kg) of HCQ had any beneficial effect on clinical disease or SARS-CoV-2 kinetics (replication\/shedding) in the Syrian hamster disease model. Similarly, HCQ prophylaxis\/treatment (6.5 mg\/kg) did not significantly benefit clinical outcome nor reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication\/shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract in the rhesus macaque disease model. In conclusion, our preclinical animal studies do not support the use of HCQ in prophylaxis\/treatment of COVID-19.One Sentence Summary Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis\/treatment showed no beneficial effect in SARS-CoV-2 hamster and macaque disease models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Rosenke","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Michael Jarvis","author_inst":"University of Plymouth"},{"author_name":"Friederike Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Schwarz","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Frederick Hansen","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Shanna Leventhal","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tsing-Lee Tang-Huau","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Martha Nason","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Julie Callison","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Elaine Haddock","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Graham Sewell","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Catherine Bosio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"David Hawman","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Isabella Renzi","author_inst":"Moderna, Inc."},{"author_name":"Wing-Pui Kong","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Stephen D.

Methods: Data were retrospective collected from adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital. We described the clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding of patients with COVID-19 and evaluated factors associated with prolonged virus shedding by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Among 238 patients, the median age was 55.5 years, 57.1% were female, 92.9% (221\/238) used arbidol, 58.4% (139\/238) used arbidol combination with interferon. The median time from illness onset to start arbidol was 8 days (IQR, 5-14 days) and the median duration of SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding was 23 days (IQR, 17.8-30 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance was significantly delayed in patients who received arbidol >7 days after illness onset, compared with those in whom arbidol treatment was started less than or equal to7 days after illness onset (HR, 1.738 [95% CI, 1.339-2.257], P < .001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that prolonged viral shedding was significantly associated with initiation arbidol more than seven days after symptom onset (OR 2.078, 95% CI [1.114-3.876], P .004), more than 7 days from onset of symptoms to first medical visitation (OR 3.321, 95% CI[1.559-7.073], P .002), illness onset before Jan.31, 2020 (OR 3.223, 95% CI[1.450-7.163], P .021). Arbidol combination with interferon was also significantly associated with shorter virus shedding (OR .402, 95% CI[.206-.787], P .008). Conclusions: Early initiation of arbidol and arbidol combination with interferon as well as consulting doctor timely after illness onset were helpful for SARS-CoV-2 clearance.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yaya Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinliang He","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianchu Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu e Xue","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengyuan Liang","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Bohan Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Wanli Ma","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Long Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaorong Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"},{"author_name":"Frederick Hansen","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Shanna Leventhal","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tsing-Lee Tang-Huau","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Martha Nason","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Julie Callison","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Elaine Haddock","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Graham Sewell","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Catherine Bosio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"David Hawman","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Isabella Renzi","author_inst":"Moderna, Inc."},{"author_name":"Wing-Pui Kong","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Stephen D.

Many different products have been used to meet the demands of large-scale diagnostic and surveillance testing. The stability of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was assessed in several commercially produced transport media and an in-house solution. Coronavirus RNA was rapidly destroyed in the commercial transport media though the deleterious effects on intact virus were limited. Similar results were obtained for a Type A influenza virus. There was reduced detection of both virus and nucleic acid when a herpesvirus sample and purified DNA were tested. Collectively these data showed that the commercial viral transport media contained nucleases or similar substances and may seriously compromise diagnostic and epidemiological investigations.\n\nRecommendations to include foetal bovine serum as a source of protein to enhance the stabilising properties of viral transport media are contraindicated. Almost all commercial batches of foetal bovine serum contain pestiviruses and at times other bovine viruses. In addition to the potential for there to be nucleases in the transport medium, the presence of these viruses and other extraneous nucleic acid in samples may compromise the interpretation of sequence data. The inclusion of foetal bovine serum presents a biosecurity risk for the movement of animal pathogens and renders these transport media unsuitable for animal disease diagnostic applications. While these transport media may be suitable for virus culture purposes, there could be misleading results if used for nucleic acid-based tests. Therefore, these products should be evaluated to ensure fitness for purpose.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter D Kirkland","author_inst":"Elizabeth Macarthur Agriculture Institute"},{"author_name":"Melinda J Frost","author_inst":"Elizabeth Macarthur Agriculture Institute, Woodbridge Rd, Menangle 2568 NSW Australia"},{"author_name":"Nir Paran","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Dana Stein","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shirley Lazar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Elad Milrot","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Yafit Atiya-Nasagi","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ofir Schuster","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Shanna Leventhal","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tsing-Lee Tang-Huau","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Martha Nason","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Julie Callison","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Elaine Haddock","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Graham Sewell","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Catherine Bosio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"David Hawman","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Heinz Feldmann","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Isabella Renzi","author_inst":"Moderna, Inc."},{"author_name":"Wing-Pui Kong","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Stephen D.

We present a rapid method for nanobody isolation that includes an optimized immunization regimen coupled with VHH library E. coli surface display, which allows single-step selection of high-affinity nanobodies using a simple density gradient centrifugation of the bacterial library. The selected single and monomeric Nanobody, W25, binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with sub-nanomolar affinity and efficiently competes with ACE-2 receptor binding. Furthermore, W25 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 wild type and the D614G variant with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, demonstrating its potential as antiviral

Here, we examine the possibility that the multivalent RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein (N) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) compacts RNA via protein-RNA liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and that N interactions with host RNA-binding proteins are mediated by phase separation. To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a N-terminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for purification. Using in vitro phase separation assays, we find that N is assembly-prone and phase separates avidly. Phase separation is modulated by addition of RNA and changes in pH and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, N enters into in vitro phase separated condensates of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2) and their low complexity domains (LCs). However, N partitioning into the LC of FUS, but not TDP-43 or hnRNPA2, requires cleavage of the solubilizing MBP fusion. Hence, LLPS may be an essential mechanism used for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viral genome packing and host protein co-opting, functions necessary for viral replication and hence infectivity.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodora Myrto Perdikari","author_inst":"Center for Biomedical Engineering, Brown University"},{"author_name":"Anastasia C

Complete understanding of COVID-19, the multi-faceted disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, requires suitable small animal models, as does the development and evaluation of vaccines and antivirals2. Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters. We propose that comparative assessment in young versus aged hamsters of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and treatments may yield valuable information as this small-animal model appears to mirror age-dependent differences in human patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Luca D.

A rush to find the cures prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing therapeutics vis-a-vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in supporting the mechanistic studies of drug\/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the non-covalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2\/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease of its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2\/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/142794v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ce764corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8909corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e13fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2383a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts-Amherst"},{"author_name":"Yi Du","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts-Amherst"},{"author_name":"Igor A Kaltashov","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts-Amherst"},{"author_name":"Fabio Luiz Monteiro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Peixoto da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Luciana Jesus da Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Edison  Luiz Durigon","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas"},{"author_name":"Amilcar Tanuri","author_inst":"UFRJ"},{"author_name":"Wanderley de Souza","author_inst":"Unniversidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Jakob Trimpert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yago Margolles","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Biotechnology, National Biotechnology Center, Superior Council of Scientific Research, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Natalia L\u00f3pez Gonz\u00e1lez del Rey","author_inst":"Comprehensive Neuroscience Center AC (CINAC), HM Puerta del Sur, Madrid M\u00f3stoles Hospital, 28938 Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Zaray Miranda Chacon","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Studies on the Nervous System and Institute of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Alexei Cuevas","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Studies on the Nervous System and Institute of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Anne Berking","author_inst":"Berking Biotechnology, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Camila Deride","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Studies on the Nervous System and Institute of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Gonzalez-Moraga","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Studies on the Nervous System and Institute of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Hector Mancilla","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Studies on the Nervous System and Institute of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Daniel Maturana","author_inst":"NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Floessergasse 4, 81369 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Langer","author_inst":"NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Floessergasse 4, 81369 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Juan Pablo Toledo","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Studies on the Nervous System and Institute of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Ananda M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Uberti","author_inst":"Institute of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Pamela Ehrenfeld","author_inst":"Institute of Anatomy, Histology, and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"Javier Blesa","author_inst":"Comprehensive Neuroscience Center AC (CINAC), HM Puerta del Sur, Madrid Mostoles Hospital, 28938 Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pedro Chana-Cuevas","author_inst":"CETRAM & Faculty of Medical Science Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile"},{"author_name":"German Rehren","author_inst":"Technology Transfer and Licensing division, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"},{"author_name":"David Schwefel","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, German"},{"author_name":"Luis \u00c1ngel Fernandez","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Biotechnology, National Biotechnology Center, Superior Council of Scientific Research, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Rojas-Fernandez","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Studies on the Nervous System and Institute of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile."},{"author_name":"Lauren A.

Based upon its similarity to p6 from SARS-CoV, it may play a similar role, namely as an antagonist of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Here we report the sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain passaged six times after original isolation from a clinical patient in Hong Kong. The genome sequence shows a 27 nt in-frame deletion ({Delta}27,264-27,290) within ORF6, predicted to result in a 9 aa deletion ({Delta}FKVSIWNLD) from the central portion of p6. This deletion is predicted to result in a dramatic alteration in the three-dimensional structure of the resultant protein (p6{Delta}22-30), possibly with significant functional implications. Analysis of the original clinical sample indicates that the deletion was not present, while sequencing of subsequent passages of the strain identifies the deletion as a majority variant. This suggests that the deletion originated ab initio during passaging and subsequently propagated into the majority, possibly due to the removal of selective pressure through the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. The specific function of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 N-terminus, if any, has not yet been determined. However, this deletion is predicted to cause a shift from N-endo to N-ecto in the transmembrane localization of the SARS-CoV-2 p6{Delta}22-30 N-terminus, possibly leading to the ablation of its native function.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco A.
