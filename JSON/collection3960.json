On 2 March 2020, the Moroccan Ministry of Health confirmed the first COVID-19 case in Morocco. The new virus SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the sample of a Moroccan expatriate residing in Italy. Without a therapeutic vaccine or specific antiviral drugs, early detection and isolation become essential against novel Coronavirus. This study aims to analyze the epidemiological profile of the SARS-CoV-2 in Moroccan cases and to investigate the dynamic of RdRp gene, N gene, and E gene in patients from diagnosis until the recovery. Among 859 Covid-19 RT-PCR tests realized for 285 patients, 133 cases had positive results Covid-19. 9 % of these cases present the 3 genes RdRp, N, and E, 47% only the RdRp gene, 2% with RdRp and N gene, 26% cases are positives with N gene, and 16 % with N and E gene. The analysis of the Covid-19 genes (RdRp, N, and E) dynamic reveal that more than 6% stay positive with detection of the N and E gene, and 14% with the N gene after 12 days of treatment. The median period from positive to the first negative Covid-19 RT-PCR tests was 6.8{+\/-}2.24 days for 44% cases, 14.31 {+\/-} 2.4 days for 30%, and 22.67 {+\/-} 1.21 days for 4%. This a first description of the Moroccan COVID-19 cases and the analysis of the dynamic of the 3 genes RdRp, N, and E. The analysis of our population can help to involved in the care of patients.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Houda Benrahma","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Idrissa Diawara","author_inst":"Faculty of Science and Health Techniques, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Imane Smyej","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Jalila Rahoui","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Nida Meskaouni","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rachid Benmessaoud","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Khadija Arouro","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Khadija Jaras","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Zahra Adam","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Salma Nahir","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Zineb Aouzal","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Hajar Elguazzar","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Leila Jeddane","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Fadwa Ousti","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Jalila Elbakkouri","author_inst":"National Reference Laboratory, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.20135095","rel_title":"Observational Study of Metformin and Risk of Mortality in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.20135095","rel_abs":"Background Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are significant risks for mortality in Covid19. Metformin has been hypothesized as a treatment for COVID19. Metformin has sex specific immunomodulatory effects which may elucidate treatment mechanisms in COVID-19. In this study we sought to identify whether metformin reduced mortality from Covid19 and if sex specific interactions exist. Methods De-identified claims data from UnitedHealth were used to identify persons with at least 6 months continuous coverage who were hospitalized with Covid-19. Persons in the metformin group had at least 90 days of metformin claims in the 12 months before hospitalization. Unadjusted and multivariate models were conducted to assess risk of mortality based on metformin as a home medication in individuals with T2DM and obesity, controlling for pre-morbid conditions, medications, demographics, and state. Heterogeneity of effect was assessed by sex. Results 6,256 persons were included; 52.8% female; mean age 75 years. Metformin was associated with decreased mortality in women by logistic regression, OR 0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects OR 0.780 (0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards: HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity matching, OR of 0.759 (0.601, 0.960). TNF-alpha inhibitors were associated with decreased mortality in the 38 persons taking them, by propensity matching, OR 0.19 (0.0378, 0.983). Conclusions Metformin was significantly associated with reduced mortality in women with obesity or T2DM in observational analyses of claims data from individuals hospitalized with Covid-19. This sex-specific finding is consistent with metformin reducing TNF-alpha in females over males, and suggests that metformin conveys protection in Covid-19 through TNF-alpha effects. Prospective studies are needed to understand mechanism and causality.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carolyn Bramante","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Ingraham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Thomas Murray","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Schelomo Marmor","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Shane Hoversten","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Jessica Gronski","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Chace McNeil","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Ruoying Feng","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Guzman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nermine Abdelwahab","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Samantha King","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meehan","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Bradley Benson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota, M Health Fairview"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pendleton","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"United Health Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

However, despite their long-term use and only few case reports on adverse effects, CQ and HCQ are listed as a known risk of the lethal ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes and their cardiac safety profile is being questioned. Thus, we aimed to investigate the electrocardiographic and mortality effects of CQ and HCQ in a primary care population. Methods: We used Danish health care registers and electrocardiograms (ECGs) from primary care to define three studies. 1) A paired study of subjects with ECGs before and during use of CQ\/HCQ, 2) a matched ECG study of subjects taking CQ\/HCQ compared to controls, and 3) a mortality study on people taking HCQ matched to control. In both matched studies, we adjusted for connective tissue diseases, use of QT-prolonging drugs, and cardiac disease. We used the QTc interval as the marker for electrocardiographic safety. In the mortality study, cases were followed from first claimed prescription until 300 days after estimated completion of the last prescription. 95% confidence intervals follow estimates in parenthesis. Results: Use of CQ was associated with a 5.5 (0.7;10) ms increase in QTc in the paired study (n=10). In the matched study (n=28, controls=280), QTc was insignificantly increased in subjects taking CQ by 4.7 (-3.4;13) ms. With a {Delta}QTc of 1.0 (-5.6;7.5), use of HCQ was not associated with an increased QTc in the paired study (n=32). In the matched study (n=172, controls=1,720), QTc also was not different between groups (p=0.5). In the mortality study (n=3,368), use of HCQ was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.67 (0.43;1.05). Conclusions: In subjects free of COVID-19, we found a small increase in QTc associated with use of chloroquine, but not hydroxychloroquine. We found no increased mortality associated with use of hydroxychloroquine.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonas L Isaksen","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Anders Gaarsdal Holst","author_inst":"Acesion Pharma"},{"author_name":"Adrian Pietersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen General Practitioners' Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jonas Bille Nielsen","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Claus Graff","author_inst":"Aalborg University"},{"author_name":"Jorgen K Kanters","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Chace McNeil","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Ruoying Feng","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Guzman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nermine Abdelwahab","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Samantha King","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meehan","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Bradley Benson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota, M Health Fairview"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pendleton","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"United Health Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

The W-LSTM model developed in this study, performs better in terms of MSE, R2 and MAPE, as compared to the previously published models, including ARIMA, LSTM and their variations. Using W-LSTM model, we have predicted the beginning and end of the current cycle of COVID-19 in several countries. Performance of the model was validated as satisfactory in 82% of the 50 test countries, while asking for prediction for 10 days beyond the period of training. Accuracy of the above prediction with days beyond training was assessed in comparison with the MAPE that the model gave with cumulative global data. The model was applied to study correlation between the growth of infection and deaths, and a number of effectors that may influence the epidemic. The model identified age groups, trade with China, air traffic, country temperature and CoV-2 virus types as the likely effectors of infection and virulence leading to deaths. The predictors likely to promote or suppress the epidemic were identified. Some of the predictors had significant effect on the shape parameters of Weibull distribution. The model can function on cloud, take inputs in real time and handle large data country wise, at low costs to make predictions dynamically. Such predictions are highly valuable in guiding policy makers, administration and health.

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) for the first 18 secondary patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Bahia Blanca (Argentina). We ranked the fiability of the data depending upon certainty about the identification of the infector and the date of exposition to infector. The sample has some missing values. In the case of incubation, as 3 patients were infected by other household members, we only have 15 observations with an observed date of exposition. For the estimation of serial interval, one patient became ill from close contact with an asymptomatic infectious. Also, estimations of both the incubation period and the serial interval were carried using the full sample and a subsample with higher certainty about the transmissor and date of exposition. By the time the dataset was prepared all infectors were recovered so estimations do need to take into account right censoring. Results: The mean incubation period for symptomatic patients is 7.9 days (95% CI: 4.6, 11.1) considering the sample of 15 cases patients and 7.5 days (95% CI: 4.1, 10.9) if the sample is restricted to the most certain cases (n=12). The median is 6.1 (95% CI: 4.1, 9.2) and 5.8 (95% CI: 3.6, 9.3) respectively. Moreover, 97.5% of symptomatic cases will develop symptoms after 13.6 days from exposition (95% CI 10.7, 16.5). The point estimation for the mean serial interval is 6.8 days (95% CI: 4.0-9.6). Considering only the most certain pairs, the mean serial interval is estimated at 5.5 days (95% CI: 2.8, 8.1). The estimated median serial intervals were 5.2 (95% CI: 3.0, 8.1) and 4.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 6.9) days respectively. Conclusions: Evidence from Bahia Blanca (Argentina) suggests that the median and mean serial interval of Covid-19 is shorter than the incubation period. This suggests that a pre-symptomatic transmission is not negligible. Comparisons with foreign estimates show that incubation period and serial interval could be longer in Bahia Blanca city than in other regions. That poses a signal of opportunity to attain more timely contact tracing and effective isolation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valentina Viego","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional del Sur"},{"author_name":"Milva Geri","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional del Sur, IIESS-Conicet"},{"author_name":"Juan Castiglia","author_inst":"Hospital Municipal Leonidas Lucero"},{"author_name":"Ezequiel Jouglard","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional del Sur"},{"author_name":"Claus Graff","author_inst":"Aalborg University"},{"author_name":"Jorgen K Kanters","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Chace McNeil","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Ruoying Feng","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Guzman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nermine Abdelwahab","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Samantha King","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meehan","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Bradley Benson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota, M Health Fairview"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pendleton","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"United Health Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

To mitigate the risks and capitalise on opportunities for positive change, we must understand how the impact has been mediated by sociodemographics, mental disorders, personality traits, life circumstances and the coping measures people choose to take. METHODS Data were collected from 376,987 members of the general public, predominantly in the UK, between late December 2019 and May 2020. Interaction models examined differences in sociodemographic distributions of mood and anxiety for 233,268 people in January vs. 109,749 in May. Factor analysis of a comprehensive instrument determined the dimensionality of self-perceived pandemic-driven change in wellbeing, outlook and behaviour for 74,830 participants in May. Linear modelling identified demographic, contextual, clinical, and trait predictors of pandemic impact. Topic modelling distilled prevalent advice from free-text responses. RESULTS Anxiety, depression and insomnia changed markedly in demographically-mediated ways. Untoward changes were larger for older adults. Benefits were greater for younger adults. Social connectedness was negatively affected across most mental and neurological conditions. There were disorder-specific changes in other domains, e.g., heightened conflict at home for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and heightened anxiety for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, occupational variables and living conditions were amongst the strongest predictors of pandemic impact. Frontline health workers, carers of vulnerable older adults, and disabled or sheltered adults were disproportionately affected. Fifty advice topics were identified from free-text, the prevalence of which covaried with subpopulation, context and traits. CONCLUSIONS The general public report positive and negative consequences of the pandemic. Particular subsets of people have heightened risk of untoward effects whereas other groups appear resilient. To be valid and effective, studies seeking to quantify, predict or mitigate the impact of pandemics on mental health should apply holistic approaches, combining multiple psycho-socio-economic factors.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam Hampshire","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Hellyer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Eyal Soreq","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William Trender","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mitul A Mehta","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ioannidis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Jon E Grant","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Samuel R Chamberlain","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Guzman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nermine Abdelwahab","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Samantha King","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meehan","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Bradley Benson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota, M Health Fairview"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pendleton","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"United Health Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

Psychological and physical well-being of health personnel has been significantly affected by COVID-19. Work overload and continuous exposure to positive COVID-19 cases have caused them fatigue, stress, anxiety, insomnia and other detriments. This research aims: 1) to analyze whether the use of cognitive reevaluation and emotional suppression strategies decreases and increases, respectively, stress levels of health personnel, 2) to quantify the impact of contact with patients with COVID-19 on stress s level of medical staff. Method. Emotion regulation strategies and stress level were evaluated in 155 Dominican physicians by means of psychological tests with adequate levels of reliability. In addition, a questionnaire created by the researchers quantified the impact that contact with those infected had on their stress levels. Results. Contact with patients with COVID-19 predicts increased use of emotion suppression strategies, although is not associated with the use of cognitive reevaluation. These findings lead to an even greater increase in stress on health care providers. Conclusions. Contextual contingencies demand immediate responses and may not allow health personnel to use cognitive re-evaluation strategies, leaning more towards emotion suppression.

Such programs may reduce current stress and prevent post-traumatic symptoms.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zoilo Emilio Garcia-Batista Sr.","author_inst":"PontificiaUniversidad Catolica Madre y Maestra"},{"author_name":"Kiero Guerra-Pena Sr.","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra"},{"author_name":"Vahid Vahid Nouri Kandany","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo"},{"author_name":"Maria Isabel Marte","author_inst":"Universidad Tecnologica de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Luis Eduardo Garrido Sr.","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad cATOLICA mADRE Y maestra"},{"author_name":"Luisa Marilia Cantisano-Guzman","author_inst":"Pontificia Univrsidad Catolica Madre y Mestra"},{"author_name":"Luciana Moretti","author_inst":"Universidad Siglo 21"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Medrano","author_inst":"Universidad Siglo 21"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Guzman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nermine Abdelwahab","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Samantha King","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meehan","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Bradley Benson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota, M Health Fairview"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pendleton","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"United Health Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

In this paper, our objectives are to characterize the public discussion of treatments on Twitter, and demonstrate the utility of these discussions for public health surveillance. We pulled tweets related to three promising COVID-19 treatments (hydroxychloroquine, remdevisir and convalescent plasma), between the dates of February 28th and May 22nd using the Twitter public API. We characterize treatment tweet trends over this time period. Most major tweet\/retweet\/sentiment trends correlated to public announcement made by the white house and\/or to new clinical trial evidence about treatments. Most of the websites people shared in treatment-related tweets were non-scientific media sources that leaned conservative. Hydroxychloroquine was the most discussed treatment on Twitter, and over 10% of hydroxychloroquine tweets mentioned an adverse drug reaction. There is a gap between the public attention\/discussion around COVID-19 treatments and their evidence. Twitter data can and should be used public health surveillance during this pandemic, as it is informative for monitoring adverse drug reactions, especially as many people avoid going to hospitals\/doctors.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tymor Carpenter Hamamsy","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Richard Bonneau","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Vahid Vahid Nouri Kandany","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo"},{"author_name":"Maria Isabel Marte","author_inst":"Universidad Tecnologica de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Luis Eduardo Garrido Sr.","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad cATOLICA mADRE Y maestra"},{"author_name":"Luisa Marilia Cantisano-Guzman","author_inst":"Pontificia Univrsidad Catolica Madre y Mestra"},{"author_name":"Luciana Moretti","author_inst":"Universidad Siglo 21"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Medrano","author_inst":"Universidad Siglo 21"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Guzman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nermine Abdelwahab","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Samantha King","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meehan","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Bradley Benson","author_inst":"University of Minnesota, M Health Fairview"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pendleton","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"United Health Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

However, most studies have focused on the effect of COVID-19 on kidney function, whereas data regarding kidney function on the COVID-19 prognosis is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between eGFR on admission and the mortality rate of COVID-19. Methods We recruited 336 adult consecutive patients (male 57.1%, mean age 55.0 {+\/-}15.9) that were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the tertiary care university hospital. Data were collected from the electronic health records of the hospital. On admission, eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula. Acute kidney injury was defined according to the KDIGO criteria. Binary logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between eGFR on admission and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Results Baseline eGFR was under 60 mL\/min\/1.73m2 in 61 patients (18.2%). Acute kidney injury occurred in 29.1% of the patients. In-hospital mortality was calculated as 12.8%. Age-adjusted and multivariate logistic regression analysis (p:0.005, odds ratio:0.974, CI:0.956-0.992) showed that baseline eGFR was independently associated with mortality. Additionally, age-adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in patients with an eGFR under 60 mL\/min\/1.73m2. Conclusions On admission eGFR seems to be a prognostic marker for mortality in patients with COVID-19; We recommend to determine eGFR in all patients on admission and use it as an additional tool for risk stratification. Close follow-up should be warranted in patients with reduced eGFR.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sinan Trabulus","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Cebrail Karaca","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Ilker Inanc Balkan","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Mevlut Tamer Dincer","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Murt","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Seyda Gul Ozcan","author_inst":"Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Ridvan Karaali","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Bilgul Mete","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Alev Bakir","author_inst":"Halic University, Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics"},{"author_name":"Mert Ahmet Kuskucu","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Riza Altiparmak","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Fehmi Tabak","author_inst":"Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Nurhan Seyahi","author_inst":"Istanbul University- Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pendleton","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"United Health Group, Research and Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher J.

Automatic disease detection framework assists the doctors in the diagnosis of disease and provides exact, consistent, and fast reply as well as reduces the death rate. Therefore, an automated detection system should be implemented as the fastest way of diagnostic option to impede COVID-19 from spreading. This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short -term memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. In this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. A collection of 421 X -ray images including 141 images of COVID-19 is used as a dataset in this system. The experimental results show that our proposed system has achieved 97% accuracy, 91% specificity, and 100% sensitivity. The system achieved desired results on a small dataset which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become available. The proposed system can assist doctors to diagnose and treatment the COVID-19 patients easily.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

However, insufficient consideration of appropriate methodologies in the guideline development could lead to misleading information, uncertainty among professionals, and potentially harmful actions for patients. Purpose: Rapid systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and recommendations in the context of COVID-19 to explore if basic methodological standards of guideline development have been met. Data sources: MEDLINE [PubMed], CINAHL [Ebsco], Trip and manual search; from Feb 1st 2020 until April 27th 2020. Study selection: All types of healthcare workers providing any kind of healthcare to any patient population in any setting. Data extraction: At least two reviewers independently extracted guideline characteristics, conducted critical appraisal according to The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) and classified the guidelines using the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) Guidance Manual and Rules for Guideline Development. We plan six-month updates (living review). Data synthesis: There were 1342 titles screened and 188 guidelines included. The highest average AGREE II domain score was 89% for scope and purpose, the lowest for rigor of development (25%). Only eight guidelines (4%) were based on a systematic literature search and a structured consensus process by representative experts (classified as the highest methodological quality, S3 according to AWMF). Patients were only included in the development of one guideline. A process for regular updates was described in 27 guidelines (14%). Limitations: Methodological focus only. Conclusions: Despite clear scope, most publications fell short of basic methodological standards of guideline development. Future research should monitor the evolving methodological quality of the guidelines and their updates over time.

With the outbreak of novel corona virus, WHO on 30th January 2020 declared it a Public Health Emergency and further on 11th March 2020, Covid-19 disease was declared a pandemic. India in the initial stages of the pandemic dealt with it in a very effective manner. With timely implementation of lockdown, India was able to contain the spread of Covid-19 to some extent. However with the recently announced Unlock 1.0, the SARS CoV-2 is expected to spread. This study aims to track and analyze the Covid-19 situation in major states that constitute of 70 percent of the total cases. Thus the states selected for the study are: Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. These are the states which had more than ten thousand Covid-19 patients as\/on June 10th 2020. The analysis period is from March 25th to June 10th and the data source is India Covid-19 tracker. To assess the previous and current Covid-19 situations in these states indicators such as Active rates, Recovery rate, Case fatality rate, Test positivity rate, tests per million, cases per million, test per confirmed case has been used. The study finds that although the absolute number of active cases may be rising, however it is showing a decreasing trend with an increase in recovery rates. With increasing number of Covid-19 cases, testing also has increased however not in the similar proportion and thus by developed nation standard we are lagging. With increasing TPR and cases per million, Delhi is well on its way to surpass even Mumbai which till now has proven to be worst hit in this pandemic. An interesting finding is that of test per confirmed case which shows that every 6th person in Maharashtra and every 8th in Delhi is showing positive result of Covid-19 test. Given such an increase and unlocked India, Delhi might soon enter into the third stage of community transmission where source of 50 percent or more cases would be unknown. There has been an increase in the Covid-19 related health infrastructure with the public-private partnership which involved both private hospitals and lab joining hands to battle Covid-19, however, affordability still remains an issue. If experts are to be believed, pandemic is not over because we have unlocked. The worst is yet to come as Covid-19 is predicted to peak in mid-July to August in India. Thus, it would be advisable to not venture out unnecessarily just because restrictions have been lifted. Also, following the guidelines- hand-washing, avoiding public gathering, social distancing and covering nose and mouth has now become imperative.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhinesh Singh","author_inst":"Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai."},{"author_name":"Samriddhi S Gupte","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai"},{"author_name":"Erika Mosor","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Valentin Ritschl","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Linda C Li","author_inst":"University of British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jasmin K Ma","author_inst":"University of British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Adalberto Campo Arias","author_inst":"University of Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Baker","author_inst":"University of Sheffield, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola W Burton","author_inst":"Griffith University, Mt.

It became imperative to implement accurate diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on respiratory samples. In many places, however, besides the limited availability of test reagents, laboratory personnel face the challenge of adapting their working routines to manipulate highly infective clinical samples. Here, we proposed the use of a virus-inactivating solution as part of a sample collection kit to decrease the infectious potential of the collected material without affecting the integrity of RNA samples used in diagnostic tests based on RT-qPCR. Methods Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and from laboratory personnel using a commercially available viral transport solution (VTM) and the denaturing solution (DS) described here. RNA extracted from all samples was tested by RT-qPCR using probes for viral and human genes. Exposure of laboratory personnel to infective viruses was also accessed using ELISA tests. Findings The use of the DS did not interfere with the detection of viral genome or the endogenous human mRNA, since similar results were obtained from samples collected with VTM or DS. In addition, all tests of laboratory personnel for the presence of viral RNA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were negative.

Pre-existing hypertension (OR:3.2,95%CI: 1.2-8.9), moderate\/severe ARDS (OR: 3.4, 95%CI: 1.1-10.8),lymphocyte counts <0.5 (OR: 6.1, 95%CI: 1.2-29.8) albumin < 22 (OR: 7.5, 95%CI: 2.1-26.2), procalcitonin >0.2 (OR: 3.8, 95%CI: 1.3-7.8), D-Dimer >1200 (OR: 5.1, 95%CI: 1.2-21.6), and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (OR: 9.3, 95%CI: 2.4-36.2) were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion This study describes the clinical characteristics and predictors of mortality among ICU patients. Early identification of risk factors to mortality might help in their better outcome.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariam Ayed","author_inst":"Neonatal Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Abdulwahab Borahmah","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia & Critical Care, Al-Sabah Hospital,Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Anwar Yazdani","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia & Critical Care, Al-Sabah Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Sultan","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia & Critical Care, Amiri Hospital , Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Mossad","author_inst":"Anaesthesia Department & Critical Care, Al-Amiri Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Hanouf Rawdhan","author_inst":"Head of Department of Anesthesia & Critical Care, Infectious Diseases Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Sarah AR Sergio","author_inst":"Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Maria Marta Figueiredo","author_inst":"Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Raissa P Rocha","author_inst":"Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Ana Paula SM Fernandes","author_inst":"Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro A Alves","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz\/FIOCRUZ and Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Santuza MR Teixeira","author_inst":"Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Flavio G da Fonseca","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Souzi Makri","author_inst":"The Cyprus League Against Rheumatism and Platform Organization for People for Rheumatic diseases in Southern Europe, Nicosia, Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Sandra Mintz","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Rikke Moe","author_inst":"Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Morasso","author_inst":"UCLA Health, Los Angeles, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Susan L Murphy","author_inst":"University of Michigan, MI, United States"},{"author_name":"Simiso Ntuli","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Maisa Omara","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Simancas Pallares","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, United States"},{"author_name":"Jen Horonieff","author_inst":"Savvy Cooperative, Queens, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Gerald Gartlehner","author_inst":"Cochrane Austria, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133934","rel_title":"Hospital-based autonomous pre-clinical screening of COVID-19: An emergency triage using a vital signs recording system, Paris-Ile de France region.","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133934","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic toll worldwide on the populations but also has been essentially supported by the existing public health system, particularly hospital-based emergency wards and intensive care units. In France, the first cases were identified on the 24th of January 2020. The first epidemic sprout emerged in the Eastern part of the country and spread in two weeks towards the center to the Paris-region where it peaked on the 14th of April 2020. In Paris and the region around it, the intensity of the epidemic has increased significantly to have a strong impact on all public and private hospital systems in a few weeks. During France's 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, a private hospital went into a major organizational change of its Emergency Department which mainly included the use of a Telemedicine Booth for vitals automatic recording during triage procedures. The present study describes the organizational scheme adopted by the hospital and discusses the data of 1,844 patients that attended the facility over a month. While among them, 766 patients were engaged in an automated triage process supported by a Telemedicine Booth. Patients' clinical characteristics are comparable to those found in international literature during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of the Telemedicine Booth as a screening process facilitated patients' flow. It usefully participated in the patient rapid orientation, relieving the hospital emergency department, actively contributes in a safe and secure environment highly trusted by the hospital staff and health workers. To our knowledge, the Telemedicine Booth use as a screening process during an epidemic constitutes the first contribution to such an innovative approach.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert Brizio","author_inst":"Hopital Delafontaine, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Valerie Faure","author_inst":"Hopital Prive du Vert Galant, Tremblay en France, France"},{"author_name":"Franck Baudino","author_inst":"Health for Development, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Wilmet","author_inst":"Health for Development, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean Paul Gonzalez","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Georgetown University, Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Washington, DC 20057 USA.

While scientists are busy finding a vaccine and medicine, it becomes difficult to control the spread and manage patients. Mathematical models help one get a better feel for the challenges in patient management. With this in mind, our team developed a model called Multilevel Integrated Model with a Novel Systems Approach (MIMANSA). MIMANSA is a multi-parametric model. One of the challenges in the design of MIMANSA was to simulate the incubation period of coronavirus. The incubation period decides when virus-infected patients would show symptoms. The probability distribution function (PDF), when applied to the number of virus-infected cases, gives a good representation of the process of the incubation period. The probability distribution functions can take various forms. In this paper, we explore a variety of PDFs and their impact on parameter estimation in the MIMANSA model. For our experiments, we used Weibull, Gaussian, uniform, and Gamma distribution. To ensure a fair comparison of Weibull, Gaussian, and Gamma distribution, we matched the peak value of the distribution. Our results show that the Weibull distribution with shape 7.7 and scale 7 for 14 days gives a better training model and predictions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhilasha P.

Estimated R0 values are only useful, however, if they accurately predict the future potential rate of spread. Using mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and county-aggregates in the USA. Most of the high among-county variance in the rate of spread was explained by four factors: the timing of the county-level outbreak (partial R2 = 0.093), population size (partial R2 = 0.34), population density (partial R2 = 0.13), and spatial location (partial R2 = 0.42). Of these, the effect of timing is explained by early steps that people and governments took to reduce transmission, and population size is explained by the sample size of deaths that affects the statistical ability to estimate R0. For predictions of future spread, population density is important, likely because it scales the average contact rate among people. To generate support for a possible explanation for the importance of spatial location, we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread (P = 0.016). The high predictability of R0 based on population density and spatial location allowed us to extend estimates to all 3109 counties in the lower 48 States. The high variation of R0 among counties argues for public health policies that are enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony R Ives","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Claudio Bozzuto","author_inst":"Wildlife Analysis GmbH, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Gunasekera","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Joshua Havumaki","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Virginia E.

With a descriptive epidemiological framing, we assessed whether historical patterns of regional influenza burden are reflected in the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases across regions of the world. Methods Weekly surveillance data reported in FluNet from January 2017-December 2019 for influenza and World Health Organization for COVID-19 (to May 31, 2020) across the seven World Bank regions were used to assess the total and annual number of influenza and COVID-19 cases per country, within and across all regions, to generate comparative descending ranks from highest to lowest burden of disease. Results Across regions, rankings of influenza and COVID-19 were relatively consistent. Europe and Central Asia and North America ranked first and second for COVID-19 and second and first for influenza, respectively. East Asia and the Pacific traditionally ranked higher for influenza with recent increases in COVID-19 consistent with influenza season. Across regions, Sub-Saharan Africa ranked amongst the least affected by both influenza and COVID-19. Conclusion Consistency in the regional distribution of the burden of COVID-19 and influenza suggest shared individual, structural, and environmental determinants of transmission. Using a descriptive epidemiological framework to assess shared regional trends for rapidly emerging respiratory pathogens with better studied respiratory infections may provide further insights into the differential impacts of non-pharmacologic interventions and intersections with environmental conditions. Ultimately, forecasting trends and informing interventions for novel respiratory pathogens like COVID-19 should leverage epidemiologic patterns in the relative burden of past respiratory pathogens as prior information.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefan D Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Katherine B Rucinski","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Jean Olivier Twahirwa Rwema","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Amrita Rao","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Neia Prata Menezes","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Daouda Diouf","author_inst":"Enda Sant\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Adeeba Kamarulzaman","author_inst":"Universiti Malaya"},{"author_name":"Nancy Phaswana-Mafuya","author_inst":"North West University"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Ana Paula SM Fernandes","author_inst":"Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro A Alves","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz\/FIOCRUZ and Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Santuza MR Teixeira","author_inst":"Centro de Tecnologia de Vacinas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Flavio G da Fonseca","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Souzi Makri","author_inst":"The Cyprus League Against Rheumatism and Platform Organization for People for Rheumatic diseases in Southern Europe, Nicosia, Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Sandra Mintz","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Rikke Moe","author_inst":"Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Morasso","author_inst":"UCLA Health, Los Angeles, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Susan L Murphy","author_inst":"University of Michigan, MI, United States"},{"author_name":"Simiso Ntuli","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Maisa Omara","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Simancas Pallares","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, United States"},{"author_name":"Jen Horonieff","author_inst":"Savvy Cooperative, Queens, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Gerald Gartlehner","author_inst":"Cochrane Austria, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20134478","rel_title":"The influence of comorbidity on the severity of COVID-19 disease: systematic review and analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20134478","rel_abs":"Background: A novel form of coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly across the world. What risk factors influence the severity of the disease is of considerable importance. Aim: This research offers a systematic review and meta-analysis of the correlation between common clinical conditions and comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Methodology: Two independent researchers searched Europe PMC, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases for articles related to influence comorbidities have on the progress of the disease. A search engine was also created to screen a further 59,000 articles in COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Random-effects modeling was used to pool 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and odds ratios (ORs). The significance of all comorbidities and clinical conditions to the severity of the disease was evaluated by employing machine-learning techniques. Publication bias was assessed by using funnel-plots and Egger's test. Heterogeneity was tested using I2. Results: The meta-analysis incorporated 12 studies spanning 4,101 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Chinese hospitals. The prevalence of the most commonly associated co-morbidities and their corresponding odds ratio for disease severity were as follows: coronary heart disease (OR 2.97 [CI: 1.99-4.45], p < 0.0001), cancer (OR 2.65 [CI: 1.12-6.29], p < 0.03), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.89 [CI: 1.90-4.40], p < 0.0001), COPD (OR 3.24 [CI: 1.66-6.32], p = 0.0), and kidney disease (OR 2.2.4 [CI: 1.01-4.99], p = 0.05) with low or moderate level of heterogeneity. The most frequently exhibited clinical symptoms were fever (OR 1.37 [CI: 1.01-1.86], p = 0.04), myalgia\/fatigue (OR 1.31 [CI: 1.11-1.55], p = 0.0018), and dyspnea (OR 3.61, [CI: 2.57-5.06], p = <0.0001). No significant associations between disease severity and liver disease, smoking habits, and other clinical conditions, such as a cough, respiratory\/ARDS, diarrhea or chest tightness\/pain were found. The meta-analysis also revealed that the incubation period was positively associated with disease severity. Conclusion: Existing comorbidities, including COPD, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, increase the severity of COVID-19. Some studies found a statistically significant association between comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and disease severity.

Results: Higher genetically proxied BMI and lifetime smoking score were associated with increased risk of sepsis in both UK Biobank (BMI: odds ratio 1.38 per standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 1.51; smoking: odds ratio 2.81 per standard deviation increase, 95% CI 2.09-3.79) and HUNT (BMI: 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69; smoking: 1.93, 95% CI 1.02-3.64). Higher genetically proxied BMI and lifetime smoking score were also associated with increased risk of severe covid-19, although with wider confidence intervals (BMI: 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.57; smoking: 3.94, 95% CI 1.13 to 13.75). There was limited evidence to support associations of genetically proxied lipid traits, systolic blood pressure or type 2 diabetes liability with risk of sepsis or severe covid-19. Similar findings were generally obtained when using Mendelian randomization methods that are more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, although the precision of estimates was reduced. Conclusions: Our findings support a causal effect of elevated BMI and smoking on risk of sepsis and severe covid-19. Clinical and public health interventions targeting obesity and smoking are likely to reduce sepsis and covid-19 related morbidity, along with the plethora of other health-related outcomes that these traits adversely affect.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ponsford J Mark","author_inst":"University Hospital Wales"},{"author_name":"Apostolos Gkatzionis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Venexia Walker","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Andrew Grant","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Robyn E Wootton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Segun Fatumo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Mason","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Verena Zuber","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Cristen Willer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Humaira Rasheed","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Brumpton","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jen Horonieff","author_inst":"Savvy Cooperative, Queens, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Gerald Gartlehner","author_inst":"Cochrane Austria, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20134734","rel_title":"Epidemiological characterization of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 in Colombia","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20134734","rel_abs":"Objective: Asymptomatic carriers (AC) of the new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent an important source of spread for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We use publicly available timeline data on the Covid-19 outbreak for nine indian states to calculate the important quantifier of the outbreak, the sought after Rt or the time varying reproduction number of the outbreak. This quantity can be measured in in several ways, e.g. by application of Stochastic compartmentalised SIR (DCM) model, Poissonian likelihood based (ML) model & the exponential growth rate (EGR) model. The third one is known as the effective reproduction number of an outbreak. Here we use, mostly, the second one. It is known as the instantaneous reproduction number for an outbreak. This number can faithfully tell us the success of lockdown measures inside indian states, as containment policy for the spread of Covid-19 viral disease. This can also, indirectly yield notional value of the generation time inteval in different states. In doing this work we employ, pan India serial interval of the outbreak estimated directly from data from January 30th to April 19th, 2020. Simultaneously, in conjunction with the serial interval data, our result is derived from incidences data between March 14th, 2020 to June 1st, 2020, for the said states. We find the lockdown had marked positive effect on the nature of time dependent reproduction number in most of the Indian states, barring a couple. The possible reason for such failures have been investigated.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Subhayan Mandal","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute Of Technology"},{"author_name":"Debasish Sarkar","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Giovanny Herrera","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Luis M Pombo","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Albert Avila","author_inst":"Universidad de la Sabana"},{"author_name":"Carolina Florez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Luis Perez Garcia","author_inst":"Incubadora Venezolana de Ciencia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jen Horonieff","author_inst":"Savvy Cooperative, Queens, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Gerald Gartlehner","author_inst":"Cochrane Austria, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.162529","rel_title":"The enzymatic activity of the nsp14 exoribonuclease is critical for replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.162529","rel_abs":"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCoronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional nsp14 contains an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain. While the latter presumably operates during viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN-knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously found to have a crippled but viable hypermutation phenotype. Remarkably, using an identical reverse genetics approach, an extensive mutagenesis study revealed the corresponding ExoN-knockout mutants of another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), to be non-viable. This is in agreement with observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses. Only a single MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant could be recovered, likely because the introduced D191E substitution is highly conservative in nature. For 11 other MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants, not a trace of RNA synthesis could be detected, unless - in some cases - reversion had first occurred. Subsequently, we expressed and purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and established in vitro assays for both its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that were lethal when tested via reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity, while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study thus reveals an additional function for MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, thus differentiating it from the proofreading activity thought to boost long-term replication fidelity in MHV and SARS-CoV.\n\nIO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWThe bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, the ExoN domain was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating some form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are alive while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we now established that the equivalent knockout mutants of MERS-CoV ExoN are non-viable and completely deficient in RNA synthesis, thus revealing an additional and more critical function of ExoN in coronavirus replication. Both enzymatic activities of (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14 were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natacha S.

In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the disease epidemic as a pandemic. Thus, a quarantine was imposed by many governments. As a consequence, and given that epidemiological outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as Covid-19, are associated with psychological disorders and symptoms of mental illness, researchers at the Shanghai Mental Health Center have created the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), in which the results are obtained: normal, mild\/moderate distress and severe distress. The main objective of the study was based on the application of CPDI, in order to identify the health and well-being of Brazilian students from different undergraduate courses at the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo (PUC\/SP) during the Covid-19 pandemic and to test the hypothesis that medical students suffer more than students from other courses. The research is based on a cross-sectional observational study, in which we applied, using Google FormsR, the questions contained in CPDI, among with demographic data: age, sex, educational institution, undergraduate course and school year. The Index was applied online for seven days in which a total of 654 valid responses were obtained: 501 (76.6%) female and 149 (22.8%) male. Regarding age, 333 students (50.91%) were 17-20 years old, 279 (42.66%) between 21-25, 30 (4.59%) between 26-30 and 12 (1.84%) between 31-50. The results indicate that the participants reported significant psychological distress, according to the CPDI score. Practically 90% (87.92%) of the students experienced suffering, while only 12.08% did not suffer. The study provides the first empirical evidence on the level of psychological distress in Brazilian university students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, it suggests support and monitoring of university students during and after the pandemic, with effective and efficient intervention in their mental health.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos von Krakauer Hubner Sr.","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcella Lima Bruscatto","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafaella Dourado Lima","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sergi Vilanova-Rotllan","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Les Corts, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ethel Sequeira-Aymar","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mireia Sans-Corrales","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elisenda Sant-Arderiu","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laia Cayuelas-Redondo","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Angela Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Noem\u00ed Garc\u00eda Plana","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"August Anguita-Guimet","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Les Corts, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jaume Benavent-\u00c0reu","author_inst":"Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jen Horonieff","author_inst":"Savvy Cooperative, Queens, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Gerald Gartlehner","author_inst":"Cochrane Austria, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133595","rel_title":"Clozapine treatment and risk of COVID-19.","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133595","rel_abs":"Background Clozapine, an antipsychotic with unique efficacy in treatment resistant psychosis, is associated with increased susceptibility to infection, including pneumonia.

Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted HR = 2.62 (95% CI 1.73 - 3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted hazard ratio HR=1.76, 95% CI 1.14 - 2.72). Conclusions These findings provide support for the hypothesis that clozapine treatment is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. Further research will be needed in other samples to confirm this association. Potential clinical implications are discussed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Risha Govind","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniela Fonesca de Freitas","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Megan R Pritchard","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard D Hayes","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James H MacCabe","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mireia Sans-Corrales","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elisenda Sant-Arderiu","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laia Cayuelas-Redondo","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Angela Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Noem\u00ed Garc\u00eda Plana","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"August Anguita-Guimet","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Les Corts, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jaume Benavent-\u00c0reu","author_inst":"Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jen Horonieff","author_inst":"Savvy Cooperative, Queens, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Gerald Gartlehner","author_inst":"Cochrane Austria, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"}]}
