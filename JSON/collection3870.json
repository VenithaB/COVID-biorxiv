Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic, including inferences of the geographic location of ancestral lineages and the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures. This information will enable further study of the necessity and timeliness of border closures.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah A Nadeau","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Timothy G Vaughan","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Scir\u00e9","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jana S Huisman","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tanja Stadler","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127837","rel_title":"Persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication in severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127837","rel_abs":"Background: The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on viral RNA detection by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) in respiratory samples. This detection can remain positive for weeks without implying virus viability. Methods: We have performed cell culture to assess viral replication in 106 respiratory samples rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 105 patients with COVID-19. Fifty were samples from 50 patients with mild forms of COVID-19 who did not require hospital admission. Fifty-six samples were obtained from 55 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia. Samples were obtained at different time points covering the time from clinical diagnosis to the follow up during hospital care. Results: In 49 samples (49\/106, 46.2%) a cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected in cell culture. Our study demonstrates that while in patients with mild COVID-19, viral viability is maintained in fact up to 10 days in patients with severe COVID-19 the virus can remain viable for up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms. Patients with severe COVID-19 as compared with mild cases, presented infective virus in a significantly higher proportion in samples with moderate or low viral load (Ct value > 26): 22\/46 (47.8%) versus 7\/38 (18.4%), (p <0.01), respectively. Conclusions: Persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication could be demonstrated in severe COVID-19 cases for periods up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms and even at high Ct values. COVID-19 severity is a more determining factor for viral viability than the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms or the Ct value obtained in the RT-PCR assay.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Folgueira","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Joanna Luczkowiak","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Fatima Lasala","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion Hospital 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Perez-Rivilla","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Rafael Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125369","rel_title":"First Clinical Use of Lenzilumab to Neutralize GM-CSF in Patients with Severe and Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125369","rel_abs":"Background: In COVID-19, high levels of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and inflammatory myeloid cells correlate with disease severity, cytokine storm, and respiratory failure. With this rationale, we used lenzilumab, an anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and risk factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use IND application. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes, and adverse events were recorded. All patients receiving lenzilumab through May 1, 2020 were included in this report. Results: Twelve patients were treated with lenzilumab. Clinical improvement was observed in 11 out of 12 (92%), with a median time to discharge of 5 days. There was a significant improvement in oxygenation: The proportion of patients with SpO2\/FiO2 < 315 at the end of observation was 8% vs. compared to 67% at baseline (p=0.00015). A significant improvement in mean CRP and IL-6 values on day 3 following lenzilumab administration was also observed (137.3 mg\/L vs 51.2 mg\/L, p = 0.040; 26.8 pg\/mL vs 16.1 pg\/mL, p = 0.035; respectively). Cytokine analysis showed a reduction in inflammatory myeloid cells two days after lenzilumab treatment. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab, and no mortality in this cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions: In high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with improved clinical outcomes, oxygen requirement, and cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zelalem Temesgen","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Mariam Assi","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Paschalis Vergidis","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Stacey A.

Self-collection of diagnostic specimens at home offers an avenue to allow people to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response without traveling to a clinic or laboratory. Before this study, survey respondents indicated willingness to self-collect specimens for COVID-related tests, but hypothetical willingness can differ from post-collection acceptability after participants collect specimens. Methods: 153 US adults were enrolled in a study of the willingness and feasibility of patients to self-collect three diagnostic specimens (saliva, oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) card) while observed by a clinician through a telehealth session. After the specimens were collected, 148 participants participated in a survey about the acceptability of the collection, packing and shipping process, and their confidence in the samples collected for COVID-related laboratory testing. Results: A large majority of participants (>84%) reported that collecting, packing and shipping of saliva, OPS, and DBS specimens were acceptable. Nearly nine in 10 (87%) reported being confident or very confident that the specimens they collected were sufficient for laboratory analysis. There were no differences in acceptability for any specimen type, packing and shipping, or confidence in samples by gender, age, race\/ethnicity, or educational level. Conclusions: Self-collection of specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing and preparing and shipping specimens for analysis were acceptable in a diverse group of US adults. Further refinement of materials and instructions to support self-collection of saliva, OPS and DBS specimens for COVID-related testing is needed.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariah Valentine-Graves","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eric Hall","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jodie Lynn Guest","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Adam","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Valencia","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Hardee","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kaitlin Shinn","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Travis Howard Sanchez","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Aaron J Siegler","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Hugo E.

An assessment of mortality relative to mortality in the general population is presented. Design: Retrospective population-based study. Setting: Individual information on symptomatic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and subsequent deaths from any cause were compared to the all-cause mortality in the Swiss population of 2018. Starting February 23, 2020, mortality in covid-19 patients was monitored for 80 days and compared to the population mortality observed in the same time-of-year starting February 23, 2018. Participants: 5 160 595 inhabitants of Switzerland aged 35 to 95 without covid-19 (general population in spring 2018) and 20 769 persons tested positively for covid-19 (spring 2020). Measurements: Sex- and age-specific mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute probabilities of death were predicted and risk was assessed in terms of relative mortality by taking the ratio between the sex- and age-specific absolute mortality in covid19 patients and the corresponding mortality in the 2018 general population. Results: A confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased the probability of death across all patient groups, ranging from nine (6 to 15) times the population mortality in 35-year old infected females to a 53-fold increase (46 to 59) for 95 year old infected males. The highest relative risks were observed among males and older patients. The magnitude of these effects was smaller compared to increases observed in absolute mortality risk. Male covid-19 patients exceeded the population hazard for males (hazard ratio 1.20, 1.00 to 1.44). Each additional year of age increased the population hazard in covid-19 patients (hazard ratio 1.04, 1.03 to 1.05). Limitations: Information about the distribution of relevant comorbidities was not available on population level and the associated risk was not quantified. Conclusions: Health care professionals, decision makers, and societies are provided with an additional population-adjusted assessment of covid-19 mortality risk. In combination with absolute measures of risk, the relative risks presented here help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the actual impact of covid-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Torsten Hothorn","author_inst":"Universitaet Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Bopp","author_inst":"Universitaet Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Huldrych F Guenthard","author_inst":"Universitaetsspital Zuerich"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"Universite de Geneve"},{"author_name":"Maroussia Roelens","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Weibull","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael J Crowther","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Elise Morawiec","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Pierre Hausfater","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Alain Combes","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Thomas Similowski","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Dale Chappell","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc.

On March 18, 2020, Para notified the first case of COVID-19. After seven weeks, the number of confirmed cases reached 4,756 with 375 deaths. Knowing that infected people may be asymptomatic, the disease symptomatology absence and the population's neglect of isolation influence the spread, and factors such as chronic pneumonia, high age, obesity, chronic kidney diseases and other comorbidities favor the mortality rate. On the other hand, social isolation, quarantine and lockdown seek to contain the intraregional contagion advance.

We used nationwide, de-identified smartphone GPS data to estimate county-level social distancing. COVID-19 incidence and mortality data were from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

Methods: We used data on hospitalizations with confirmed SARSCoV2 infection from the Mexican Ministry of Health in ten 5-year age groups: 10 to 14 through 55 to 59 years. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in that age group among all hospitalized cases aged 10-59 years during the early period (between April 20 to May 3, 2020), the corresponding proportion L(g) during the later periods (May 11 to 24), as well as the relative risk RR(g)= L(g)\/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, RR(g1)>RR(g2) is interpreted as a relative increase in SARSCoV2 infections in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The highest RR estimates belong to persons aged 15 to 19 years (RR=1.93(95% CI (1.19,3.12)) and 20 to 24 years (RR=1.40(1.07,1.83)).

The aim of this study was to investigate the method used by the Imperial College COVID-19 Research Team (ICCRT) for estimation of NPI effects from the system theoretical viewpoint of model identifiability. Methods: An input-sensitivity analysis was performed by running the original software code of the systems model that was devised to estimate the impact of NPIs on the reproduction number of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and presented online by ICCRT in Report 13 on March 30 2020. An empirical investigation was complemented by an analysis of practical parameter identifiability, using an estimation theoretical framework. Results: Despite being simplistic with few free parameters, the system model was found to suffer from severe input sensitivities. Our analysis indicated that the model lacks practical parameter identifiability from data. The analysis also showed that this limitation is fundamental, and not something readily resolved should the model be driven with data of higher reliability. Discussion: Reports based on system models have been instrumental to policymaking during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. With much at stake during all phases of a pandemic, we conclude that it is crucial to thoroughly scrutinise any SARS-CoV-2 effect analysis or prediction model prior to considering its use as decision support in policymaking. The enclosed example illustrates what such a review might reveal.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristian Soltesz","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Gustafsson","author_inst":"Linkoping University"},{"author_name":"Toomas Timpka","author_inst":"Region Ostergotland"},{"author_name":"Joakim Jalden","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Carl Jidling","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Albin Heimerson","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Thomas B.

Here, we introduce a reparameterized SIQRD network model that accounts for local political decisions to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the pandemic in Germany at county and city resolution. Our optimized model reproduces state-wise cumulative infections and deaths as reported by the Robert-Koch Institute, and predicts development for individual counties at convincing accuracy. We demonstrate the dominating effect of local infection seeds, and identify effective measures to attenuate the rapid spread. Our model has great potential to support decision makers on a state and community politics level to individually strategize their best way forward.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andreas Kergassner","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Christian Burkhardt","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Dorothee Lippold","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Sarah Nistler","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Kergassner","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Paul Steinmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Dominik Budday","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Silvia Budday","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Joakim Ekberg","author_inst":"Region Ostergotland"},{"author_name":"Orjan Dahlstrom","author_inst":"Linkoping University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Bagge Carlson","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Anna Joud","author_inst":"Region Skane"},{"author_name":"Bo Bernhardsson","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"APHP Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Dale Chappell","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc.

Many countries in the world implemented social isolation as a strategy to contain the virus transmission. The same physical distancing which protects society from COVID-19 from spreading may have an impact on the mental health and well-being of the population This study aims to shed some light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship between physical activity and SWB among individuals in the social isolation period of COVID-19. Methods: Data were collected in Brazil between March 31st and April 2nd, 2020. All volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement right after reading the Consent Terms. The inclusion criteria were participants over 18 years old who had been in social isolation for at least one week and agreed to the Consent Terms. Three instruments were used: a questionnaire was built for this study which aimed to assess the participants' exercise routine. The second instrument called Psychosocial Aspects, Well-being and Exercise in Confinement (PAWEC) was also created by these researchers and aimed to assess the relationship between well-being and physical activity during the social isolation period. And the third measure was the Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Findings: A total of 592 participants reported being in social isolation for an average of 14.4 (SD=3.3) days. The amount of participants who reported strength training as exercise increased from 31 (5.2%) before isolation to 82 (13.9%) during quarantine. The study shows that well-being related to the practice of physical activity during quarantine is linked to an established routine of physical activity prior to the social isolation period. Interpretation: People who already practiced physical activity feel more motivated to continue practicing during this period and this causes the appearance of positive affects, unlike people who are only now starting to exercise; according to the study, negative aspects can occur for those who are only just starting. In a period of social isolation, it is important that the practice of physical activity is closer to previous habits, also finding that an obligation to exercise during this period when this was not a reality for the person can contribute to an increase in malaise.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliana Marques de Abreu","author_inst":"Institute of Physical Education and Sports, Ceara Federal University, Fortaleza, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Roberta Andrade de Souza","author_inst":"Institute of Physical Education and Sports, Ceara Federal University, Fortaleza, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Livia Gomes Viana-Meireles","author_inst":"Institute of Physical Education and Sports, Ceara Federal University, Fortaleza, Brazil"},{"author_name":"J.

This unexpected disruption in everyday life has raised concerns about weight management, especially in high-risk populations of women and individuals with overweight and obesity. This study aimed to investigate the changes in behaviors that may impact energy intake and\/or energy expenditure in U.S. adults during the home confinement. Methods: Cross-sectional data from 1,779 adults were collected using an online Qualtrics survey between April 24th and May 4th, 2020. Self-reported data on demographics, eating behaviors, physical activity, sleep, screen time, takeout food intake, and food purchasing behaviors were collected. Chi-Square analyses were conducted to evaluate differences in the percent of participants reporting increasing, decreasing, or staying the same in each health behavior since the COVID-19 outbreak in their area. Each analysis was followed by comparing whether increases or decreases were more likely for each health behavior. Similar comparisons were made between male and female participants and between body mass index (BMI) categories. Results: We observed an increase in the intake of both healthy and energy-dense unhealthy foods and snacks during the home confinement. Participants also reported increases in sedentary activities and decrease in physical activity, alcohol intake, and consumption of takeout meals during this time. In women, several behavioral changes support greater energy intake and less energy expenditure than men. No clear difference in patterns was observed across BMI status. Conclusion: Acute changes in behaviors underscore the significance of a sudden increase in unstructured time at home on potential weight gain. Our findings support the need to implement and support measures that promote strategies to maintain body weight and establish a methodology to collect body weight data at multiple time points to longitudinally assess the dynamic relationship between behaviors and body weight change.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Surabhi Bhutani","author_inst":"San Diego State University, San Diego, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Cooper","author_inst":"University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle R Vandellen","author_inst":"University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA"},{"author_name":"J.

First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-COv-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuals susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID19. Functional ACE1 and ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID19. Methods: We studied 204 COVID19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 indel and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Results: Severe COVID19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p=0.046), and the ACE1-DD genotype (p=0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID19. Conclusions: Adverse outcome of COVID19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype. The ACE1-indel was a significant risk factor for severe COVID19, but the effect was dependent on the hypertensive status.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"JUAN GOMEZ","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"GUILLERMO M ALBAICETA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"MARTA GARCIA-CLEMENTE","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"CARLOS LOPEZ-LARREA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"LAURA AMADO","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"TAMARA HERMIDA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"ANA I ENRIQUEZ","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"PABLO HERRERO","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"SANTIAGO MELON","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"MARTA E ALVAREZ-ARGUELLES","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"SUSANA ROJO-ALBA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"ALVARO LEAL-NEGREDO","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"REBECA LORCA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"ELIAS CUESTA-LLAVONA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"ELIECER COTO","author_inst":"HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO CENTRAL DE ASTURIAS-HUCA"},{"author_name":"Omar Ahmed","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc."},{"author_name":"Reona Sakemura","author_inst":"T Cell Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;  Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Cameron Durrant","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc.

In Ireland, the first NH case of COVID-19 occurred on 16\/03\/2020. A national point-prevalence testing program of all NH residents and staff took place from 18\/04\/2020-05\/05\/2020. Aims: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Community Health Organisations (CHOs) in Ireland, proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident, symptom-profile and resident case-fatality. Methods: Forty-five NHs surveyed across three CHOs requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, timing of outbreak, total symptomatic\/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29\/02\/2020-22\/05\/2020. Results: Surveys were returned from (62.2%, 28\/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2303 beds). Three-quarters (21\/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first case of COVID-19 in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident COVID-19 incidence was (43.9%, 764\/1741): laboratory-confirmed (40.1%, 710\/1741) with (27.2%, 193\/710 asymptomatic), and clinically-suspected (3.1%, 54\/1741). Resident case-fatality was (27.6%, 211\/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed\/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NH with an early outbreak (<28days) versus a later outbreak developed confirmed\/suspected COVID-19. A lower proportion of residents in NHs with early outbreaks had recovered compared to those with late outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; X2=56.9, p<0.001). Among 675 NH staff across twenty-four sites who had confirmed\/suspected COVID-19 (23.6%, 159\/675) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed\/suspected COVID-19 (Spearmans rho=0.81, p<0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates COVID-19 impact on NH residents and staff. High infection rates lead to challenges in care provision.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean P Kennelly","author_inst":"Department of Age-Related Healthcare, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Adam H Dyer","author_inst":"Department of Age-Related Healthcare, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ruth Martin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine for the Elderly, Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Siobhan M Kennelly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine for the Elderly, Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Alan Martin","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric and Stroke Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Desmond O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Age-Related Healthcare, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Aoife Fallon","author_inst":"Department of Age-Related Heathcare, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland"},{"author_name":"PABLO HERRERO","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"SANTIAGO MELON","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"MARTA E ALVAREZ-ARGUELLES","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"SUSANA ROJO-ALBA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"ALVARO LEAL-NEGREDO","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"REBECA LORCA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"ELIAS CUESTA-LLAVONA","author_inst":"HUCA"},{"author_name":"ELIECER COTO","author_inst":"HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO CENTRAL DE ASTURIAS-HUCA"},{"author_name":"Omar Ahmed","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc."},{"author_name":"Reona Sakemura","author_inst":"T Cell Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN;  Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Cameron Durrant","author_inst":"Humanigen, Inc.

Cases were asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients identified between 1 and 31 March 2020 who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by 21 April 2020; controls were asymptomatic contacts who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Participants were queried about practices during contact periods with a case.

Wearing masks all the time during contact was independently associated with lower risk of COVID-19 infection compared to not wearing masks (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.60), while sometimes wearing masks during contact was not (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41-1.84).

Methods: Evaluation of de-identified electronic health records of 7,592 COVID-19 patients confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 lab tests in New York City. Medical comorbidites and outcome of mortality, and other covariates, including clinical, sociodemographic, and medication measures were assessed by bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Of common comorbid conditions (hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obesity, diabetes, HIV, cancer), when adjusted for covariates, chronic kidney disease remained significantly associated with increased odds of mortality. Patients who had more than one comorbidities, former smokers, treated with Azithromycin without Hydroxychloroquine, reside within the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens Higher had higher odds of death. Conclusions: Increasing numbers of comorbid factors increase COVID-19 mortality, but several clinical and sociodemographic factors can mitigate risk. Continued evaluation of COVID-19 in large diverse populations is important to characterize individuals at risk and improve clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"AN-LI WANG","author_inst":"ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Zhong","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yasmin Hurd","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chaiwisar Janekrongtham","author_inst":"Panjagampatthana"},{"author_name":"Duangrat Ruampoom","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Nawaporn Daochaeng","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Napatchakorn Eungkanit","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Nichakul Pisitpayat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Nuengruethai Srisong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Oiythip Yasopa","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Patchanee Plernprom","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Pitiphon Promduangsi","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Panita Kumphon","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Paphanij Suangtho","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Peeriya Watakulsin","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Sarinya Chaiya","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Somkid Kripattanapong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Thanawadee Chantian","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Emily Bloss","author_inst":"Thailand Ministry of Public Health - U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration"},{"author_name":"Chawetsan Namwat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Direk Limmathurotsakul","author_inst":"Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127860","rel_title":"Differential impacts of contact tracing and lockdowns on outbreak size in COVID-19 model applied to China","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127860","rel_abs":"Rapid growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in China induced extensive efforts of contact tracing and social-distancing\/lockdowns, which quickly contained the outbreak and has been replicated to varying degrees around the world. We construct a novel infectious disease model incorporating these distinct quarantine measures (contact tracing and self-quarantine) as reactionary interventions dependent on current infection levels. Derivation of the final outbreak size leads to a simple inverse proportionality relationship with self-quarantine rate, revealing a fundamental principle of exponentially increasing cumulative cases when delaying mass quarantine or lockdown measures beyond a critical time period. In contrast, contact tracing results in a proportional reduction in reproduction number, flattening the epidemic curve but only having sizable impact on final size when a large proportion of contacts are \"perfectly\" traced. We fit the mathematical model to data from China on reported cases and quarantined contacts, finding that lockdowns had an overwhelming influence on outbreak size and duration, whereas contact tracing played a role in reducing peak number of infected. Sensitivity analysis and simulations under different re-opening scenarios illustrate the differential effects that responsive contact tracing and lockdowns can have on current and second wave outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cameron Browne","author_inst":"University of Louisiana at Lafayette"},{"author_name":"Hayriye Gulbudak","author_inst":"University of Louisiana at Lafayette"},{"author_name":"Joshua C.

The reason given was that the pandemic was out of control and with wide community based spread it would not be possible to contain it by tracing any longer. Like other countries the UK has since relied on a lockdown as the main measure to contain the virus (or more precisely the reproduction number R at significant economic and social cost. It is clear that this level of lockdown cannot be sustained until a vaccine is available, yet it is not clear what an exit strategy would look like that avoids the danger of a second (or subsequent waves). In this paper we argue that, when used within a portfolio of intervention strategies, widespread testing and tracing leads to significant cost savings compared to using lockdown measures alone. While the effect is most pronounced if a large proportion of the infectious population can be identified and their contacts traced, under reasonable assumptions there are still significant savings even if the fraction of infectious people found by tracing is small. We also present a policy optimization model that finds, for given assumptions on the disease parameters, the best intervention strategy to contain the virus by varying the degree of tracing and lockdown measure (and vaccination once that option is available) over time. We run the model on data fitted to the published COVID-19 outbreak figures for Scotland. The model suggests an intervention strategy that keeps the number of COVID-19 deaths low using a combination of tracing and lockdown.

Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolization of vital organs may in these individuals be direct causes of death. The identification of patients at high risk of developing thrombosis may lead to targeted, more effective prophylactic treatment. Objectives: To test whether Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) indicates hypercoagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, and whether patients with severe disease have a more pronounced hypercoagulopathy compared with less severely ill patients. Methods: The study was designed as a prospective observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: 1) regular wards or 2) wards with specialized ventilation support. ROTEM was taken after admission and the data were compared with ROTEM in healthy controls. Results: The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-\/FIBTEM-MCF) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p<0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with patients at regular wards (p<0.05). Coagulation Time (EXTEM-CT) was longer and Clot Formation Time (EXTEM-CFT) shorter in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that hypercoagulopathy is present in hospitalized patients with mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: ROTEM variables were significantly different in COVID-19 patients early after admission compared with healthy controls. This pattern was more pronounced in patients with increased disease severity, suggesting that ROTEM-analysis may be useful to predict thromboembolic complications in these patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lou Almskog","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Agneta Wikman","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of CLINTEC, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jonas Svensson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Michael Wanecek","author_inst":"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Matteo Bottai","author_inst":"Unit of Biostatistics, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jan van der Linden","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Agren","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Nichakul Pisitpayat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Nuengruethai Srisong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Oiythip Yasopa","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Patchanee Plernprom","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Pitiphon Promduangsi","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Panita Kumphon","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Paphanij Suangtho","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Peeriya Watakulsin","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Sarinya Chaiya","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Somkid Kripattanapong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Thanawadee Chantian","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Emily Bloss","author_inst":"Thailand Ministry of Public Health - U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration"},{"author_name":"Chawetsan Namwat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Direk Limmathurotsakul","author_inst":"Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127969","rel_title":"Plasma levels of soluble ACE2 are associated with sex, Metabolic Syndrome, and its biomarkers in a large cohort, pointing to a possible mechanism for increased severity in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127969","rel_abs":"We examined the associations between plasma concentrations of soluble ACE2 and biomarkers of Metabolic Syndrome in a large (N=2,051) sample of individuals who participated in a commercial wellness program and who underwent deep molecular phenotyping. sACE2 levels were significantly higher in men, compared to women, and in individuals with Metabolic Syndrome, compared to controls. sACE2 levels showed reliable associations with all individuals components of Metabolic Syndrome, including obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and as well as markers of liver damage.

The strict quarantine measures taken by governments kept a large number of people, around the world, in isolation and affected many aspects of people's lives. These unprecedented changes triggered a wide variety of psychological problems ranging from panic disorders, anxiety and depression. In this study, we aim to explore anxiety levels among parents, teachers and the general community amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE, as well as identify emotional and anxiety disorders in children. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2,200 self-selected assessed volunteers. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale , emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting the highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%) compared to parents only (14.6%) or teachers only (4.7%). Multivariate logistic regression for GAD-7 score showed that females, participants who felt public fear was justifiable, persons who worried about COVID-19, persons who intended to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smokers were all associated with anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression for SDQ showed parents who had severe anxiety levels were 7 times more likely to report more emotional problems in their children (OR=7.00, 95% CI, 3.45 to 14.0) than less anxious parents. Findings suggest the urgency of policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and teachers and more specifically for vulnerable children.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Basema Saddik","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Amal Hussein","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Ammar Albanna","author_inst":"Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital"},{"author_name":"Iffat Elbarazi","author_inst":"Abu Dhabi University"},{"author_name":"Arwa Al-Shujairi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Saheb Sharif-Askari","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Mohamad-Hani Temsah","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"emmanuel stip","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Patchanee Plernprom","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Pitiphon Promduangsi","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Panita Kumphon","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Paphanij Suangtho","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Peeriya Watakulsin","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Sarinya Chaiya","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Somkid Kripattanapong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Thanawadee Chantian","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Emily Bloss","author_inst":"Thailand Ministry of Public Health - U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration"},{"author_name":"Chawetsan Namwat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Direk Limmathurotsakul","author_inst":"Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128611","rel_title":"Using the LIST model to Estimate the Effects of Contact Tracing on COVID-19 Endemic Equilibria in England and its Regions","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128611","rel_abs":"Governments across Europe are preparing for the emergence from lockdown, in phases, to prevent a resurgence in cases of COVID-19. Along with social distancing (SD) measures, contact tracing comprising find, track, trace and isolate (FTTI) policies are also being implemented. Here, we investigate FTTI policies in terms of their impact on the endemic equilibrium. We used a generative model, the dynamic causal 'Location', 'Infection', 'Symptom' and 'Testing' (LIST) model to identify testing, tracing, and quarantine requirements. We optimised LIST model parameters based on time series of daily reported cases and deaths of COVID-19 in England and based upon reported cases in the nine regions of England and in all 150 upper tier local authorities. Using these optimised parameters, we forecasted infection rates and the impact of FTTI for each area; national, regional, and local. Predicting data from early June 2020, we find that under conditions of medium-term immunity, a '40%' FTTI policy (or greater), could reach a distinct endemic equilibrium that produces a significantly lower death rate and a decrease in ICU occupancy. Considering regions of England in isolation, some regions could substantially reduce death rates with 20% efficacy. We characterise the accompanying endemic equilibria in terms of dynamical stability, observing bifurcation patterns whereby relatively small increases in FTTI efficacy result in stable states with reduced overall morbidity and mortality. These analyses suggest that FTTI will not only save lives, even if only partially effective, and could underwrite the stability of any endemic steady-state we manage to attain.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosalyn J Moran","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Billig","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Maell Cullen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Adeel Razi","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jean Daunizeau","author_inst":"INSERM UMRS 1127"},{"author_name":"Rob Leech","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Karl J Friston","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"emmanuel stip","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Patchanee Plernprom","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Pitiphon Promduangsi","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Panita Kumphon","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Paphanij Suangtho","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Peeriya Watakulsin","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Sarinya Chaiya","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Somkid Kripattanapong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Thanawadee Chantian","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Emily Bloss","author_inst":"Thailand Ministry of Public Health - U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration"},{"author_name":"Chawetsan Namwat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Direk Limmathurotsakul","author_inst":"Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20127977","rel_title":"Estimating the Impact of Control Measures to Prevent Outbreaks of COVID-19 Associated with Air Travel into a COVID-19-free country: A Simulation Modelling Study","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20127977","rel_abs":"Aims: We aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks associated with air travel from a country with a very low prevalence of COVID-19 infection (Australia) to a COVID-19-free country (New Zealand; [NZ]), along with the likely impact of various control measures for passengers and cabin crew. Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilized. It was populated with data for both countries and parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control measures. We assumed one Australia to NZ flight per day. Results: When no interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in NZ was estimated to occur after an average time of 1.7 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 0.04-6.09). However, the combined use of exit and entry screening (symptom questionnaire and thermal camera), masks on aircraft and two PCR tests (on days 3 and 12 in NZ), combined with self-reporting of symptoms and contact tracing and mask use until the second PCR test, reduced this risk to one outbreak every 29.8 years (0.8 to 110). If no PCR testing was performed, but mask use was used by passengers up to day 15 in NZ, the risk was one outbreak every 14.1 years. However, 14 days quarantine (NZ practice in May 2020), was the most effective strategy at one outbreak every 34.1 years (0.86 to 126); albeit combined with exit screening and mask use on flights. Conclusions: Policy-makers can require multi-layered interventions to markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus into a COVID-19-free nation via air travel. There is potential to replace 14-day quarantine with PCR testing or interventions involving mask use by passengers in NZ. However, all approaches require continuous careful management and evaluation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Michael G Baker","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Martin Eichner","author_inst":"Epimos GmbH"},{"author_name":"Adeel Razi","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jean Daunizeau","author_inst":"INSERM UMRS 1127"},{"author_name":"Rob Leech","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Karl J Friston","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"emmanuel stip","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Patchanee Plernprom","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Pitiphon Promduangsi","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Panita Kumphon","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Paphanij Suangtho","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Peeriya Watakulsin","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Sarinya Chaiya","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Somkid Kripattanapong","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Thanawadee Chantian","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Emily Bloss","author_inst":"Thailand Ministry of Public Health - U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration"},{"author_name":"Chawetsan Namwat","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Tiwanon Road, Nonthaburi, 11000, Thailand."},{"author_name":"Direk Limmathurotsakul","author_inst":"Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20128215","rel_title":"CoViD-19 outbreak in Northern Italy: Did particulate matter really play a key role?","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128215","rel_abs":"Northern Italian regions have been the most affected from CoViD-19 compared to other Italian areas and are also the zones where air pollutants concentration has been higher than in the rest of Italy.

A meta-analytic study of the age-related differences and consistency over six countries","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20128439","rel_abs":"Background Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was noted that males seemed to be more affected than females. We examined the magnitude and consistency of the sex differences in age-specific case-fatality rates (CFRs) in six countries. Methods Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the published reports from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United States. Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the six countries, for seven age-groups. Findings The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The differences were greater in the younger age groups. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 2.53, 2.92, 2.57, 1.83, 1.57, 1.58 and 1.48 for ages 0-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and 90+. There was remarkable consistency between countries in the magnitude of the M:F CFRs, in each age group. In meta-regression, age group explained almost all the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios. Conclusions The sex differences in the CFRs are intriguing and are compatible with the male dominance in the incidence rates of many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the greater severity of the disease in males, particularly at younger ages, may be part of the disease mechanism and should be explored further.
