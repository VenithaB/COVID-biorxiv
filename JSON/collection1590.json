A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher P.

Furthermore, the ongoing efforts for vaccine development have necessitated the development of rapid, high-throughput methods of quantifying infectious SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ability to screen human polyclonal sera samples for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, our lab has adapted focus forming assays for SARS-CoV-2 using Vero CCL-81 cells, referred to in this text as Vero WHO. Using the focus forming assay as the basis for screening cell susceptibility and to develop a focus reduction neutralization test. We have shown that this assay is a sensitive tool for determining SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer in human, non-human primate, and mouse polyclonal sera following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Additionally, we describe the viral growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of different immortalized cell lines and demonstrate via human ACE2 and viral spike protein expression that these cell lines can support viral entry and replication.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"E.

The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a \"toxin-like\" epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the molecular model of the human 7 nAChR. We found that the interface of all studied protein complexes involves a large part of the \"toxin-like\" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human 7 nAChR.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George Lagoumintzis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Mol.

It is therefore necessary to collect fundamental information about the disease, its epidemiology and treatment, as well as about the virus itself. While the virus has been identified rapidly, detailed ultrastructural analysis of virus cell biology and architecture is still in its infancy. We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution ([~]100 nm, without peplomers). SARS-CoV showed a slightly broader size distribution with a few smaller and bigger particles than SARS-CoV-2. The segmental peplomer density of SARS-CoV was approximately 30% higher than the corresponding peplomer density of SARS-CoV-2. This result complements a previous qualitative finding, which was related to a lower productivity of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture in comparison to SARS-CoV.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Laue","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Anne Kauter","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Tobias Hoffmann","author_inst":"RobertKoch Institute"},{"author_name":"Janine Michel","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Andreas Nitsche","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Farsalinos","author_inst":"Laboratory of Mol.

The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 M (0.002 to 0.012 mg\/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 M [0.030 mg\/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy R.A.

These efforts seek to decrease the speed of propagation, although with significant social and economic costs. Countries have taken different actions, also with different results. In this article we use non-parametric techniques (HT and MST) with the aim of identifying groups of countries with a similar spread of the coronavirus. The variable of interest is the number of daily infections per country. Results show that there are groups of countries with differentiated contagion dynamics, both in the number of contagions plus at the time of the greatest transmission of the disease. It is concluded that the actions taken by the countries, the speed at which they were taken and the number of tests carried out may explain part of the differences in the dynamics of contagion.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emiliano Alvarez","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica"},{"author_name":"Juan Gabriel Brida","author_inst":"Universidad de la Republica"},{"author_name":"Erick Limas","author_inst":"Freie Universitat Berlin"},{"author_name":"Jacinth K.

This article aims to analyse the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Design: This work is a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study of 9,644 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. Setting: This study examined patients hospitalised in 147 hospitals throughout Spain. Participants: This work analysed 9,644 patients (57.12% male) out of a cohort of 12,826 patients over 18 years of age hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry as of 29 May 2020. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure of this work is the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Univariate analysis was performed to determine possible predictors of death and then multivariate analysis was carried out to control for potential confounders. Results: An increase in the eosinophil count on the seventh day of hospitalisation was associated with a better prognosis, including lower mortality rates (5.2% vs 22.6% in non-recoverers, OR 0.234 [95% CI, 0.154 to 0.354]) and lower complication rates, especially regarding to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (8% vs 20.1%, p=0.000) and ICU admission (5.4% vs 10.8%, p=0.000). Lymphocyte recovery was found to have no effect on prognosis. Treatment with inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids was not found to be a confounding factor. Conclusion: Eosinophil recovery in patients with COVID-19 is a reliable marker of a good prognosis that is independent of prior treatment. This finding could be used to guide discharge decisions.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Mateos Gonzalez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Elena Sierra Gonzalo","author_inst":"Pathology Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Irene Casado Lopez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Francisco Arnalich Fernandez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Beato Perez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Albacete University Hospital Complex, Albacete, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Monge Monge","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Segovia Hospital Complex, Segovia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Juan Antonio Vargas Nunez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rosa Garcia Fenoll","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Miguel Servet Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carmen Suarez Fernandez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, La Princesa University Hospital, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Santiago Jesus Freire Castro","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, A Coruna University Hospital, A Coruna, Spain."},{"author_name":"Manuel Mendez Bailon","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinico San Carlos Hospital, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Isabel Perales Fraile","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Sofia Hospital, San Sebastian de los Reyes, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Manuel Madrazo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Dr. Peset University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Paula Maria Pesqueira Fontan","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Santiago Clinical Hospital, Santiago de Compostela, A Coruna, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Oskar Magallanes Gamboa","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Nuestra Senora del Prado Hospital, Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, Spain."},{"author_name":"Andres Gonzalez Garcia","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Anxela Crestelo Vieitez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Royo Villanova Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain."},{"author_name":"Eva Maria Fonseca Aizpuru","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Cabuenes Hospital, Gijon, Asturias, Spain."},{"author_name":"Asier Aranguren Arostegui","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Urduliz Alfredo Espinosa Hospital, Urduliz, Vizcaya, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Coduras Erdozain","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Santa Marina Hospital, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carmen Martinez Cilleros","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, HLA Moncloa Hospital, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jose Loureiro Amigo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Moises Broggi Hospital, Sant Joan Despi, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Francisco Epelde","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Parc Tauli Hospital, Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Lumbreras Bermejo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, 12 de Octubre University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Miguel Anton Santos","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176925","rel_title":"Engineering luminescent biosensors for point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176925","rel_abs":"Current serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies mainly take the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or lateral flow assays, with the former being laborious and the latter being expensive and often lacking sufficient sensitivity and scalability.

Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India which is populated with nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Based on the average viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (in a window of 35 days) is about 6.6% of the population, which clearly indicates the rate of community transmission and asymptomatic carriers is higher than the number of reported cases. It is important to note here that the samples collected from the inlet of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative indicating the efficient treatment of sewage at STPs. These studies are going to be essential to manage the pandemic better and also to assess the effectiveness of control measure.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hemalatha Manupati","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad-500007, India"},{"author_name":"Uday Kiran","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Santosh Kumar Kuncha","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Harishankar Kopperi","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad-500007, India"},{"author_name":"Gokulan C.G.","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular.

The results of the cross-correlation analysis identify optimal temporal lags between symptoms and a range of COVID-19 outcomes, with new taste\/smell loss showing the highest correlations. We also identified temporal clusters of change in taste\/smell entries and confirmed COVID-19 incidence in Baltimore City and County.

As previous studies were limited to mathematical modeling or testing on low throughput PCR instruments, this study aimed to assess pooling on high throughput analyzers. To assess the impact of pooling, SARS-CoV-2 dilutions were performed at varying pool depths (i.e. 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) into test-negative nasopharyngeal or oropharynx\/anterior nares swabs matrix. Testing was evaluated on the automated Roche Cobas 6800 system, or the Roche MagNApure LC 2.0 or MagNAPure 96 instruments paired with a laboratory-developed test using a 96-well PCR format. The frequency of detection in specimens with low viral loads was evaluated using archived specimens collected throughout the first pandemic wave. The proportion of detectable results per pool depths was used to estimate the potential impact. In addition, workflow at the analytical stage, and pre-and post-stages of testing were also considered. The current study estimated that pool depths of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 would have allowed the detection of 98.3%, 96.0%, and 92.6% of positive SARS-CoV-2 results identified in the first wave of the pandemic in Nova Scotia. Overall, this study demonstrated that pooling on high throughput instrumentation can dramatically increase the overall testing capacity to meet increased demands, with little compromising to sensitivity at low pool depths. However, the human resources required at the pre-analytical stage of testing is a particular challenging to achieve.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason J LeBlanc","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada."},{"author_name":"Glenn Patriquin","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Janice Pettipas","author_inst":"Nova Scotia Provincial Public Health Laboratory Network (PPHLN), Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michelle Warhuus","author_inst":"Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCfV), Dalhousie University, IWK Health Centre, and Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Darren Sarty","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Colleen Jackson","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Charles Heinstein","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"James MacDonald","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"David Haldane","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Todd F Hatchette","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ralph Etienne-Cummings","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Leonel Torres","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Michael J.

Efficient, effective and economically feasible methods for large-scale PPE decontamination are urgently needed. Aims: (1) to develop protocols for effectively decontaminating PPE using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP); (2) to develop novel approaches that decrease set up and take down time while also increasing decontamination capacity (3) to test decontamination efficiency for N95 respirators heavily contaminated by makeup or moisturizers. Methods: We converted a decommissioned Biosafety Level 3 laboratory into a facility that could be used to decontaminate N95 respirators. N95 respirators were hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with makeup or moisturizer. A VHP VICTORYTM unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination process. Findings: N95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Makeup and moisturizer creams did not interfere with the decontamination process. Conclusions: Respirator stacking can reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labeled paper bags. Make up or moisturizers do not appear to interfere with VHP decontamination.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"RICCARDO RUSSO","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Carly Levine","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Courtney Veilleux","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Blas Peixoto","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jessica McCormick-Ell","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Thomas Block","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Anthony Gresko","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Delmas","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Poonam Chitale","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Alexis Frees","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Ruiz","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"David Alland","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Miles D Chapman","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Melanie Hart","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Lunn","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cristina M.

Although mitigation measures have been globally considered, the spatial heterogeneity of its effectiveness is evident, underscoring global health inequalities. Using Bayesian-based Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, we evidenced that factors contributing to poverty are also risk factors for COVID-19 case-fatality, and unexpectedly, their impact on the case-fatality risk is comparable to that produced by health factors. Additionally, we confirm that both case-fatality risk and multidimensional poverty index have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, where the lastest consists of health, educational, dwelling, and employment dimensions. Spatio-temporal analysis reveals that the spatial heterogeneity in case-fatalities is associated with the percentage contribution of the health (RR 1.89 95%CI=1.43-2.48) and dwelling (RR 2.01 95%CI=1.37-2.63) dimensions to the multidimensional poverty, but also with the educational (RR 1.21 95%CI=1.03-1.49), and employment (RR 1.23 95%CI=1.02-1.47) dimensions. This spatial correlation indicates that the case-fatality risk increase by 189% and 201% in regions with a higher contribution of the health dimension (i.e., lack of health insurance and self-reporting) and dwelling dimension (i.e., lack of access to safe water, inadequate disposal of human feces, poor housing construction, and critical overcrowding), respectively. These findings assist policy-makers in the spatial and temporal planning of strategies focused on mitigating the case-fatality risk in most vulnerable communities and preparing for future pandemics by progressively reducing the factors that generate health inequality.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gina Polo","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Epidemiolog\u00eda y SaludP\u00fablica.

Different countries have developed and adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were the social distancing and lockdown. Though some countries have come out of this pandemic, the infection is still increasing and remains very serious in the rest of the world. Even when the disease is not under control, many countries have withdrawn the lockdown and going through the phase-wise unlocking process, causing a further increment in the infection rate. In such a scenario, the role of the undetected class of infected individuals has become very crucial. The present study is an attempt to understand and estimate the possible epidemic burden during the unlock phase in the presence of an undetected class. We proposed a modified SEIR model and dissected the epidemiological status of different countries with the available data. With the initial establishment of the model with the epidemic data of four countries, which have already attained the epidemic peak, the study focused more on countries like India and the USA, where the epidemic curve is still growing, but the unlock process has started. As a straightforward result, we noticed a significant increase in the undetected and detected infected cases under the ongoing unlock phase. Under such conditions, our recalibration exercise showed that an increase in the testing could revert the existing growth rate of the infected cases to the lower growth rate of the lockdown period. Our present study emphasizes on the implementation of 3T principles, trace, test, and treat, to contain the epidemic. The significance of large scale testing in controlling the epidemic is true for both India and the USA though they have different socio-economic conditions. The use of repurposing drugs may further decrease the infected cases and help the disease controlling process. We believe our proposed strategy obtained through a mathematical model will help to make a better policy for the unlock phase.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhijit Paul","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute"},{"author_name":"Samrat Chatterjee","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute"},{"author_name":"Nandadulal Bairagi","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Juli\u00e1n Felipe Porras Villamil","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Epidemiolog\u00eda y SaludP\u00fablica.

But few studies have empirically examined the factors driving these outcomes. We examined the association between perceived preparedness to respond to the pandemic and HCW stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors among HCWs in Ghana. Methods: Data are from HCWs in Ghana who completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey; 414 and 409 HCWs completed stress and burnout questions, respectively. Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial measures. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors. Results: The average score for preparedness was 24 (SD=8.8), 16.3 (SD=5.9) for stress, and 37.4 (SD=15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, HCWs who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had lower stress ({beta}=-1.89, 95%CI:-3.49 to -0.30 and {beta}=-2.66, 95%CI:-4.48 to -0.84) and burnout ({beta}=-7.74, 95%CI:-11.8 to -3.64 and {beta}=-9.25, 95%CI:-14.1 to - 4.41) scores than those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher stress and burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress\/burnout, accounting for about 16 to 17% of the effect. Conclusion: Low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout, and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions to increase HCWs' morale and capacity to respond to the pandemic are needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patience A Afulani","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Akua O.

Methods: Herein, we compare several analytic platforms with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 infected controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms in a clinically relevant population: 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: In control populations, the best performing antibody detection assays were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 93%), spike IgG3 (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%), and nucleocapsid (NP) protein IgG (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%). Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. The antibody assays that best predicted virus neutralization were RBD IgG (misidentified 2), spike IgG3 (misidentified 1), and NP IgG (misidentified 2). Conclusion: These data suggest that meaningful evaluation of antibody assay performance requires testing in an unknown population. Further, these results indicate coupling of virus neutralization analysis to a positive antibody test is required to categorize patients based on SARS-CoV-2 immune protection status following virus exposure or vaccine administration. One of the antibody detection platforms identified in this study followed by the pseudoneutralization or focus reduction assay would provide a practical testing strategy to assess for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with optimal prediction of correlates to neutralizing immunity.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer A Rathe","author_inst":"University of Washington \/ Seattle Children's Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Emily A Hemann","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Julie Eggenberger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqi Li","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Megan Knoll","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caleb Stokes","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Tien-Ying Hsiang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jason Netland","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deepak Modi","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Heath"},{"author_name":"Carlos Meza Carvajalino","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Epidemiolog\u00eda y SaludP\u00fablica.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents (<21 years of age) with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact. We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 293 (77%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while asthma is associated with decreased risk. Age-related differences in the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be considered when evaluating children for COVID-19 and in developing screening strategies for schools and childcare settings.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jillian H.

Methods A matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The impact of CP treatment on all cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, and the impact of CP treatment on the time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified log-rank analysis. Results 64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched control group of 177 patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.9%. There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 - 2.20). There was also no significant difference in the overall rate of hospital discharge (rate ratio [RR} 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.81), but a subgroup analysis of patients 65-years-old or greater who received CP demonstrated a significantly increased hospital discharge rate among these patients (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 - 3.36). There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion reactions in the CP group (2.8% reaction rate observed per unit transfused). Conclusions The use of CP in this study was a safe treatment for COVID-19. There was no overall significant reduction of in-hospital mortality or increased rate of hospital discharge associated with the use of CP in this study, although there was a signal for improved outcomes among the elderly. Further adequately powered randomized studies should target this subgroup when assessing the efficacy CP treatment.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ralph Rogers","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Fadi Shehadeh","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Mylona","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Josiah Rich","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Marguerite Neill","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Francine Touzard-Romo","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Sara Geffert","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Jerome Larkin","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A Bailey","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Shaolei Lu","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Sweeney","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Mylonakis","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Jenkins","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Trevor S.

Although previous studies demonstrated anti-spike and -RBD antibodies as essential for protection and convalescent plasma as a promising therapeutic option, little is known about the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes capable of blocking virus entry. Here, we studied spike- and RBD-specific Ig isotypes in plasma\/sera from two acutely infected and 29 convalescent individuals. Spike- and RBD-specific IgM, IgG1, and IgA1 antibodies were produced by all or nearly all subjects at varying levels and detected at 7-8 days post-disease onset.

Making these decisions needs a comprehensive understanding about the dynamics by which the disease spreads. In this work, we propose an epidemic agent-based model that simulates the spread of the disease. We show that the model is able to generate an important aspect of the pandemic: multiple waves of infection. A key point in the model description is the aspect of 'fear' which can govern how agents behave under different conditions. We also show that the model provides an appropriate test-bed to apply different containment strategies and this work presents the results of applying two such strategies: testing, contact tracing, and travel restriction. The results show that while both strategies could result in flattening the epidemic curve and significantly reduce the maximum number of infected individuals; testing should be applied along with tracing previous contacts of the tested individuals to be effective. The results show how the curve is flattened with testing partnered with contact tracing, and the imposition of travel restrictions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirarsalan Rajabi","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Alexander V.

Design: Parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the relationship between humidity and influenza, using five years of weekly data. Bayesian spatio-temporal models-with a Poisson and a Gaussian likelihood-are estimated to find the relationship between regional humidity and the daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the municipalities and provinces of the Netherlands. Results: An inverse (negative) relationship is observed between specific humidity and the incidence of influenza between 2015 and 2019. The space-time analysis indicates that an increase of specific humidity of one gram of water vapor per kilogram of air (1 g\/kg) is related to a reduction of approximately 5% in the risk of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion: The increase in humidity during the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands helped to reduce the risk of regional COVID-19 infections. Public policies that promote higher levels of specific humidification-above 6 g\/Kg-can lead to significant reductions in the spread of respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edsard Ravelli","author_inst":"Ravelli Management"},{"author_name":"Rolando Gonzales Martinez","author_inst":"Universitetet i Agder"},{"author_name":"Ece C.

Data were from the UCL COVID 19 Social Study; a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID 19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 55,204 adults living in the UK who were followed up for the strict 11 week lockdown period from 21st March to 31st May 2020. Data were analyzed using fixed effects and Arellano Bond models. We found that changes in time spent on a range of activities were associated with changes in mental health and wellbeing. After controlling for bidirectionality, behaviors involving outdoor activities including gardening and exercising predicted subsequent improvements in mental health and wellbeing, while increased time spent on following news about COVID 19 predicted declines in mental health and wellbeing. These results are relevant to the formulation of guidance for people obliged to spend extended periods in isolation during health emergencies, and may help the public to maintain wellbeing during future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feifei Bu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Hei Wan Mak","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Tak-Shing T.

This problem arises since COVID 19 symptoms resemble with other cases. One of the golden standards is by examining the lung using the chest X ray radiograph (CXR). Currently there is growing COVID 19 cases followed by the CXR images waiting to be analyzed and this may outnumber the health capacity. Learning from that current situation and to fulfill the demand for CXRs analysis, a novel solution is required. The tool is expected can detect and distinguish the COVID 19 case lung rely on CXR. Respectively, this study aims to propose the use of AI and machine learning aided tool to distinguish the COVID 19 and non COVID 19 cases based on the CXR lung image. The compared non COVID 19 CXR cases in this study include normal (healthy), influenza A, tuberculosis, and active smoker. The results confirm that the machine learning tool is able to distinguish the COVID 19 CXR lungs based on lung consolidation. Moreover, the tool is also able to recognize an abnormality of COVID 19 lung in the form of patchy ground glass opacity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrio Adwibowo","author_inst":"University of Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Shruti Bansal","author_inst":"Regional Biocontainment laboratory, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Colleen B.
