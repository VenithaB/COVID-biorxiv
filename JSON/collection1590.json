In humans, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) between the SARS CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2, on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract, is an initial step in the entry pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV-2 RBD \/ ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as a target for therapeutic and\/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational platforms, we predicted  hot-spot residues in a positive control PPI (PMI \/ MDM2) and the CoV-2 RBD\/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to predict changes in Gibbs free energy that are associated with mutating residues at the positive control (PMI\/MDM2) or SARS RBD\/ACE2 binding interface to alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver to calculate macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive control PPI and SARS CoV-2 \/ ACE2 PPI. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot-spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV-2 RBD \/ ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro A.

Here, we demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK synthetic peptide scaffolds act as antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells. Critically, SARS-BLOCK peptides are able to potently and competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2, the main cellular entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In order to create this potential therapeutic antidote-vaccine, we designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted peptide folding, and characterized behavior of a novel set of synthetic peptides. The biomimetic technology is modeled off the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and modified to provide enhanced stability and folding versus the truncated wildtype sequence. These novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities for ACE2 and a neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and demonstrate significant reduction of infection in nanomolar doses. We also demonstrate that soluble ACE2 abrogates binding of RBD to neutralizing antibodies, which we posit is an essential immune-evasive mechanism of the virus. SARS-BLOCK is designed to \"uncloak\" the viral ACE2 coating mechanism, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies with the intention of stimulating a specific neutralizing antibody response. Our peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise for future studies evaluating specificity and sensitivity of immune responses to our antidote-vaccine. In summary, SARS-BLOCK peptides are a promising COVID-19 antidote designed to combine the benefits of a therapeutic and vaccine, effectively creating a new generation of prophylactic and reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses can be enhanced rather than blunted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre Watson","author_inst":"Ligandal Inc."},{"author_name":"Leonardo M.R.

There are three key SARS-CoV-2 enzymes potentially targetable with antivirals: papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of these, PLpro is an especially attractive target because it plays an essential role in several viral replication processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved across different coronaviruses and promising inhibitors have already been discovered for its SARS-CoV variant. Here we report a substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several inhibitors of the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. These efforts include the first structures of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes with inhibitors, determined at 1.60-2.70 Angstroms. This collection of structures provides fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight to PLpro, and critically, illustrates details for inhibitors recognition and interactions. All presented compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of PLpro in vitro, and some molecules block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays. These collated findings will accelerate further structure-based drug design efforts targeting PLpro, with the ultimate goal of identifying high-affinity inhibitors of clinical value for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jerzy Osipiuk","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Saara-Anne Azizi","author_inst":"UChicago"},{"author_name":"Steve Dvorkin","author_inst":"UChicago"},{"author_name":"Michael Endres","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Krysten A.

We used globally reported SARS-CoV-2 cases to fit a Bayesian model framework to estimate transmission associated with NPIs in 26 countries and 34 US states. Using a mixed effects model with country level random effects, we compared the relative impact of other NPIs to national-level household confinement measures and evaluated the impact of NPIs on the global trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic over time. We observed heterogeneous impacts of the easing of restrictions and estimated an overall reduction in infection of 23% (95% CI: 18-27%) associated with household confinement, 10% (95% CI: 1-18%) with limits on gatherings, 12% (95% CI: 5-19%) with school closures and 17% (95% CI: 6-28%) with mask policies. We estimated a 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) reduction in transmission associated with NPIs overall. The implementation of NPIs have substantially reduced acceleration of COVID-19. At this early time point, we cannot determine the impact of the easing of restrictions and there is a need for continual assessment of context specific effectiveness of NPIs as more data become available.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel T Esra","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Lise Jamesion","author_inst":"Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Fox","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Daniel Letswalo","author_inst":"Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office"},{"author_name":"Nkosinathi Ngcobo","author_inst":"Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office"},{"author_name":"Sithabile Mngadi","author_inst":"Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office"},{"author_name":"Janne Global Estill","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Gesine Meyer-Rath","author_inst":"Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Alyse D.

For this purpose, the expression pattern of metabolic genes in the human genome-scale metabolic network model Recon3D was explored. We identified metabolic genes and pathways and reporter metabolites under each SARS-CoV-2-infected condition and compared them to identify common and unique changes in the metabolism. Our analysis revealed host-dependent dysregulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and lipid metabolism.

The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant. Moreover, the present and previous findings suggest that the peak concentrations of GBPA established after the clinically approved camostat mesylate dose (600 mg\/day) will result in antiviral activity.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"Deutsches Primatenzentrum GmbH - Leibniz-Institut fur Primatenforschung; Faculty of Biology and Psychology, University Goettingen, 37073 Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Heike Hofmann-Winkler","author_inst":"Deutsches Primatenzentrum GmbH - Leibniz-Institut fur Primatenforschung"},{"author_name":"Joan C.

A cross sectional study design and clustered-stratified-Random sampling strategy were used. COVID-19 IgG and IgM Rapid Test Kits (Colloidal gold immunochromatography lateral flow system) were used to determine the presence or absence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of sampled participants across Niger State as from 26th June 2020 to 30th June 2020. The test kits were validated using the blood samples of some of the NCDC confirmed positive and negative COVID-19 cases in the State. COVID-19 IgG and IgM Test results were entered into the EPIINFO questionnaire administered simultaneously with each test. EPIINFO was then used for both the descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the data generated. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State was found to be 25.41% and 2.16% for the positive IgG and IgM respectively. Seroprevalence among age groups, gender and by occupation varied widely. A seroprevalence of 37.21% was recorded among health care workers in Niger State. Among age groups, COVID-19 seroprevalence was found to be in order of 30-41 years (33.33%) > 42-53 years (32.42%) > 54-65 years (30%) > 66 years and above (25%) > 6-17 years (19.20%) > 18-29 years (17.65%) > 5 years and below (6.66%). A seroprevalence of 27.18% was recorded for males and 23.17% for females in the state. COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection are almost the same for both urban and rural dwellers in the state. However, health care workers and those that have had contact with person (s) that travelled out of Nigeria in the last six (6) months are twice ( 2 times) at risk of being infected with the virus. More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing at any time since the pandemic started. Discussions about knowledge, practice and attitude of the participants are included. The observed Niger State COVID-19 seroprevalence means that the herd immunity for COVID-19 is yet to be achieved and the population is still susceptible for more infection and transmission of the virus. If the prevalence stays as reported here, the population will definitely need COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. Niger State should fully enforce the use of face\/nose masks and observation of social\/physical distancing in gatherings including religious gatherings in order to stop or slow the spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hussaini Majiya","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Aliyu-Paiko","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Vincent Tochukwu Balogu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Dickson Achimugu Musa","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Maikudi Salihu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abdullahi Abubakar Kawu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ishaq Yakubu Bashir","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Aishat Rabiu Sani","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"John Baba","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Amina Tako Muhammad","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Fatima Ladidi Jibril","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ezekiel Bala","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Nuhu George Obaje","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Yahaya Badeggi Aliyu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ramatu Gogo Muhammad","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Hadiza Mohammed","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Usman Naji Gimba","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abduljaleel Uthman","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Hadiza Muhammad Liman","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Sule Alfa Alhaji","author_inst":"General Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kolo James","author_inst":"Niger State Ministry of Health, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muhammad Makusidi","author_inst":"Niger State Ministry of Health, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Danasabe Isah","author_inst":"General Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Abdullahi","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Umar Ndagi","author_inst":"IBB Specialised Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Bala Waziri","author_inst":"IBB Specialised Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Chindo Ibrahim Bisallah","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Naomi John Dadi-Mamud","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Kolo Ibrahim","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abu Kasim Adamu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20167643","rel_title":"Comparative Evaluation of Three Serologic Assays for the Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies","rel_date":"2020-08-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20167643","rel_abs":"Background and aims Serologic assays for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies are being developed and approved rapidly with limited external validation. Accurate diagnostics are an essential component to pandemic management and public health. Materials and methods Residual serum samples (N=113) from patients who were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection status by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were retrospectively tested in parallel across three automated SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays: Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG, Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody, and Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Results Testing of 51 PCR-positive and 62 PCR-negative patients demonstrated qualitative inter-test agreement of 96% overall, 100% in PCR-negative patients, 88% in early positive samples (0-13 days post positive PCR), and 100% in convalescent samples (14+ days post positive PCR). Calculated kappa values for paired inter-test agreement ranged 0.93-0.96. Compared to PCR, overall percent positive agreement ranged from 82-86% (100% for convalescent samples) and percent negative agreement was 100% for each assay.

Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia [2]. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation.\n\nThis manuscript is accompanied by an online resource: https:\/\/www.nupulmonary.org\/covid-19\/\n\nOne sentence summarySARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar macrophages form positive feedback loops with T cells in patients with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rogan A Grant","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Luisa Morales-Nebreda","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nikolay S Markov","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Suchitra Swaminathan","author_inst":"Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University;

Aim To evaluate a nurse-led Enhanced Care Home Team (ECHT) enhanced SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy. Design and setting Service evaluation in care homes in Norfolk UK. Method Residents and staff received nose and throat swab tests (7 April to 29 June 2020). Resident test results were linked with symptoms on days 0-14 after test and mortality to 13 July 2020. Results Residents (n=518) in 44 homes and staff (n=340) in 10 care homes were tested. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was identified in 103 residents in 14 homes and 49 staff in seven homes. Of 103 SARS-CoV-2+ residents, just 38 had typical symptom(s) at time of test (new cough and\/or fever). Amongst 54 residents who were completely asymptomatic when tested, 12 (22%) developed symptoms within 14 days. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative residents, SARS-CoV-2+ residents were more likely to exhibit typical symptoms (new cough (n=26, p=0.001); fever (n=24, p=<0.001)) or as generally-unwell (n=18, p=0.001). Of 38 resident deaths, 21 (55%) were initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2, all of whom tested SARS-CoV-2+. One death not initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2 also tested positive. Conclusion Testing identified asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2+ residents and staff. Being generally-unwell was common amongst symptomatic residents and may indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection in older people in the absence of more typical symptoms. Where a resident appears generally unwell SARS-CoV-2-infection should be suspected.

Although the capacity for recombination among Betacoronaviruses is well documented, SARS-CoV-2 has only been circulating in humans for approximately 8 months and thus has had a relatively short window of opportunity for the occurrence of recombination. The ability to detect recombination has further been limited by the relatively low levels of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, two studies have reported recombinants among SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we first revisit these findings with a new analysis approach, arguing that neither presents a clear case of within-SARS-CoV-2 recombination. Applying this same approach to available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we then identify five recombinant genomes. Each of these genomes contain phylogenetic markers of two distinct SARS-CoV-2 clades. Further, the predicted parent clades of these recombinant genomes were, with one exception, documented to be co-circulating in the country of infection in the two weeks prior to the sample being collected. Our results indicate that recombination among SARS-CoV-2 strains is occurring, but is either not widespread or often remains undetectable given current levels of viral genetic diversity. Efforts to monitor the emergence of new recombinant genomes should therefore be sustained.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David VanInsberghe","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Neish","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Anice C Lowen","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Paul R Hunter","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steel","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Paul Everden","author_inst":"NHS North Norfolk Primary Care"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Donayre","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Isaac A Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Zasu M Klug","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Borkowski","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Lu","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hermon Kihshen","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Yuliya Politanska","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lango Sichizya","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Mengjia Kang","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ali Shilatifard","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University;

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or probes binding sites. A total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency of [&ge;] 1% in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of [&ge;] 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhinav Jain","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Mercy Rophina","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Mahajan","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Bhavya Balaji Krishnan","author_inst":"Imperial College London, South Kensington, London SW7 2BU, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Manasa Sharma","author_inst":"Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560054 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sreya Mandal","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Teresa Fernandez","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sumayra Sultanji","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Samatha Mathew","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sridhar Sivasubbu","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Vinod Scaria","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Lu","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hermon Kihshen","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Yuliya Politanska","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lango Sichizya","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Mengjia Kang","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ali Shilatifard","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University;

Here, we describe the anti-COVID-19 potential of PTC299, an orally available compound that is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models. The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine inhibitory activity, and previously established favorable pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles render PTC299 a promising therapeutic for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sattler","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX, 77555, USA"},{"author_name":"Elke Muhlberger","author_inst":"Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, Boston, MA, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason D.

Using an integrative strategy, we built a reference by meta-analyzing > 300,000 immune cells from COVID-19 and 5 inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohns disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), lupus, and interstitial lung disease. Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. We found that the CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophages are transcriptionally similar to blood-derived macrophages stimulated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma} ex vivo. Our findings suggest that IFN-{gamma}, alongside TNF-, might be a key driver of this abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lorien Shakib","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sara Shanaj","author_inst":"Hospital for Special Surgery"},{"author_name":"Aparna Nathan","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"- Accelerating Medicines Partnership Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Laura T.

Methodology: Five hundred patients of both genders having age between 18-50 years who were PCR positive and had Mild COVID-19 were selected. Patients assigned to standard dose of HCQ (400mg 12 hourly day 1 then 200mg 12 hrly for next 4 days) plus SOC were 349 while 151 patients received SOC comprising of Vit C, Vit D, and Zinc only (control group). Primary outcome was progression of disease while secondary outcome was PCR negativity on day 7 and 14. The results were analyzed on SPSS version 23. P value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Median age of intervention group (34 + 11.778 years) and control group (34 + 9.813 years). Disease progressed in 16 patients, 11 (3.15%) were in intervention group as compared to 5 (3.35%) in control group, (p value = 0.865). PCR negativity in intervention and control groups were (day 7, 182 (52.1%) vs. 54 (35.7%) (p value = 0.001), (day 14, 244 (69.9%) vs. 110 (72.8%) (p value = 0.508).

A previous report in 814 patients COVID-19 positive in Cuba provided preliminary therapeutic efficacy evidence with interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) from March 11 to April 14, 2020. This study, re-evaluates the contribution of IFN-2b on the evolution of all patients, after 98 days of the epidemic, in a period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. Method A prospective observational study was implemented to monitor a therapeutic intervention with IFN alpha-2b used in the national protocol for COVID-19 attending in Cuba. Were included patients with positive throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir\/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN alpha-2b The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital, secondary was the case fatality rate and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. Results From March 11th until June 17th, 2295 patients had been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 2165 were treated with Heberon Alpha R and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. The benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed. Conclusions This second report confirm the preliminary evidences from first for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN alpha-2b for SARS-Cov-2 infection and postulated that Heberon Alpha R is the main component within the antiviral triad used as a therapeutic intervention in the Cuban protocol COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Pereda","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

It posed a significant impact on different health services, including dermatology. Methods and objectives: Two online surveys were conducted to determine the prevalence of personal protective equipment-related skin complications (200 healthcare providers were included) and to demonstrate the outbreak s impact on dermatology practice (100 dermatologists were included). Results: In the first survey, the response rate was 72.46%. PPE- related dermatoses were reported by 147 (73%) participants, including frictional dermatitis (51.9%), mechanical acne (33.1%), contact dermatitis (29.9%), nonspecific rash (17.5%), urticaria (9.1%) and skin infections (3.2%). The response rate of the second survey was 64%. COVID-19 emerging cutaneous manifestations were recognized by 20% of dermatologists, including maculopapular rash (41.67%), urticaria (37.50%), chilblain (25%) and vasculitis (16.67). Telemedicine was provided by 73% of the dermatologists. The relapse rates of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, vitiligo and alopecia areata were noticeably increased as observed by 62%, 50%, 20%, and 4% of dermatologists, respectively. Most dermatologists (89%) reported minimal use of immunosuppressive drugs amid the pandemic. Conclusions: This article highlights the pivotal role of dermatologists in the leading edge during the current health crisis and how they adapt to these unfamiliar circumstances to meet the challenges. It documents the emergence of PPE-related dermatoses among healthcare providers and the impact of COVID-19 on different aspects of dermatology practice.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed Shanshal","author_inst":"Baghdad Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hayder Saad Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Tikrit, College of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Hayder Asfoor","author_inst":"University of Kerbala, College of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raad Ibrahim Salih","author_inst":"University of Tikrit, College of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Shehab Ahmed Ali","author_inst":"Al- iskandria Hospital, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Yusif k.

Surprisingly, the incidence and the Case Fatality Rate has been much higher in the richer countries compared with the poorer countries. However, the reasons behind this dichotomy have not been explained based on data or evidence, although some of the factors for the susceptibility of populations to SARS-CoV-2 infections have been proposed. We have taken into consideration all publicly available data and mined for the possible explanations in order to understand the reasons for this phenomenon. The data included many parameters including demography of nations, prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, sanitation parameters etc. Results of our analyses suggest that demography, improved sanitation and hygiene, and higher incidence of autoimmune disorders as the most plausible factors to explain higher death rates in the richer countries Thus, the much debated hygiene hypothesis appears to lend credence to the Case Fatality Rate dichotomy between the rich and the poor countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bithika Chatterjee","author_inst":"National Centre For Cell Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rajeeva Laxman Karandikar","author_inst":"Chennai Mathematical Institute"},{"author_name":"Shekhar C.

An age-structured multi-compartmental Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model was used to estimate infection spreads under parametric variation of lockdown intensity and duration from the data of SARS-CoV2 cases in India between January to July, 2020. The resulting parameter values were used to simulate lockdown outcomes for a wide range of start times and durations. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified weights assigned to social contact matrices for work, school and other places. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Our analysis shows that lockdown outcomes depend sensitively on the timing of imposition and that it is possible to minimize lockdown durations while limiting case loads to numbers below the hospitalization thresholds. Such timing based effects arise naturally from the non-linear nature of SIR dynamics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anagh Pathak","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Varun Madan Mohan","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Arpan Banerjee","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Raad Ibrahim Salih","author_inst":"University of Tikrit, College of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Shehab Ahmed Ali","author_inst":"Al- iskandria Hospital, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Yusif k.

Little is known about public knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors in relation to the pandemic in Nepal. This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) towards COVID 19 among the general public and to identify associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May to June 2020 with a sample of 645, recruited from 26 hospitals across Nepal. We conducted telephone interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire related to KAP regarding COVID 19. T-test and one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine group differences for socio-demographic variables. Linear regression and correlational analysis were performed to identify associated factors and measure the strength and direction of relationships. Results: Overall mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 11.6 (SD 4.5), 2.7 (SD 1.8), and 9.9 (SD 1.93) respectively but differed by socio-demographic characteristics. Positive but weak linear correlations were observed between knowledge-practice (r=0.19, p<0.01) and attitude-practice (r=0.08, p<0.05). The relationship between knowledge and education was fairly strong (r = 0.34, p< 0.01). Province, place of residence, ecological area, age, gender, and caste\/ethnicity were also significantly associated with the KAP score of participants. Conclusion: The study found varying degrees of correlation between Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice that may increase as the pandemic evolves in Nepal. Knowledge and level of education had positive associations with attitude and adherence to precautionary measures. The findings suggest a need for targeted community awareness interventions for the most vulnerable populations, men, those with no school education, the elderly, and people living in rural areas.

We investigated the early transmission patterns of the virus and the outcomes of mitigation measures in the country. Methods We collected information from epidemiological surveillance, including contact tracing, and genetic data from SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes, of the first five weeks of the outbreak. These data were used to estimate the exponential growth rate, doubling time and the time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) using date of symptom onset in a Bayesian framework. The time of most recent ancestor for the introduced and circulating lineages was estimated by Bayesian analysis. Findings A total of 4210 subjects were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the period evaluated, of them we sequenced 313 cases, detecting the circulation of 10 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Whole genomes analysis identified the local transmission of one cryptic lineage as early as 2 weeks before it was detected by surveillance systems. Analysis of transmission dynamics showed that lockdown reduced Rt and increased the doubling time, however, these measures did not stop the circulation of this lineage in the country. Interpretation These results demonstrate the value of epidemiological modeling and genome surveillance to assess mitigation strategies. At the same time, an active search for cryptic transmission clusters is crucial to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a region.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danilo Franco","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Claudia Gonzalez","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Leyda E Abrego","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Jean P Carrera","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Yamilka Diaz","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Yaset Caisedo","author_inst":"Fundacion Valle del Lili.

It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods\/Design: The ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The protocol has been prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to categories 5, 6 or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and\/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment. Discussion: This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease.
