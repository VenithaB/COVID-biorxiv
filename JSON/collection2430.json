We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N=21,000-157,000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Iwona Hawryluk","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Mellan","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Henrique H Hoeltgebaum","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Schnekenberg","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Axel Gandy","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

The possibility of a new outbreak of the pandemic and how to avoid it is, nowadays, one of the primary objectives of epidemiological research. In this work, we go deep in this subject by presenting an innovative compartmental model, that explicitly introduces the number of active cases, and employing it as a conceptual tool to explore the possible fates of the dispersion of SARS-COV-2 in the Mexican context. We incorporated the impact of starting, inattention, and end of restrictive social policies on the time evolution of the pandemics via time-in-run corrections to the infection rates. The magnitude and impact on the epidemic due to post-social restrictive policies are also studied. The scenarios generated by the model can help authorities to determine an adequate time and population load that may be allowed to reassume normal activities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan Santamaria-Holek","author_inst":"UMDI-J, Faculty of Sciences, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Victor Castano","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Henrique H Hoeltgebaum","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Schnekenberg","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Axel Gandy","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here, in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lionel Roques","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Olivier Bonnefon","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Virgile Baudrot","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Samuel Soubeyrand","author_inst":"INRAE"},{"author_name":"Henri Berestycki","author_inst":"EHESS"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Axel Gandy","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

As of mid-June 2020, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with more than 7.7 million confirmed cases and more than 400,000 deaths. The impacts are substantial particularly in developing and densely populated countries like Bangladesh with inadequate health care facilities, where COVID-19 cases are currently surging. While early detection and isolation were identified as important non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures for containing the disease spread, this may not be pragmatically implementable in developing countries primarily due to social and economic reasons (i.e. poor education, less public awareness, massive unemployment). To shed light on COVID-19 transmission dynamics and impacts of NPI scenarios, e.g. social distancing, this study conducted emerging pattern analysis using the space-time scan statistic at district and thana (i.e. a sub-district or 'upazila' with at least one police station) levels in Bangladesh and its capital Dhaka city, respectively. We found that the central and south eastern regions in Bangladesh are currently exhibiting a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Dhaka megacity remains as the highest risk \"active\" cluster since early April. The space-time progression of COVID-19 infection, when validated against the chronicle of government press releases and newspaper reports, suggests that Bangladesh have experienced a community level transmission at the early phase (i.e., March, 2020) primarily introduced by Bangladeshi citizens returning from coronavirus-affected countries in the Europe and the Middle East. A linkage is evident between the violation of NPIs and post-incubation period emergence of new clusters with elevated exposure risk around Bangladesh. This study provides novel insights into the space-time patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and recommends pragmatic NPI implementation for reducing disease transmission and minimizing impacts in a resource-scarce country with Bangladesh as a case-study example.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arif Masrur","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Manzhu Yu","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Wei Luo","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Dewan","author_inst":"Curtin University"},{"author_name":"Henri Berestycki","author_inst":"EHESS"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Axel Gandy","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.

To compare the patient population, common complaints, and physician recommendations in direct-to-consumer chat-based consults, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data sources. Data on patient characteristics, patient complaints, and physician recommendations from 36,864 chat-based telemedicine consults with physicians in an online-clinic by patients from across the United States between April 2019 and April 2020. Study Design. We perform a retrospective analysis comparing patient characteristics, visit characteristics, and physician recommendation before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We examine patient age and gender, visit time, patient chief complains, and physician medical recommendation (including prescription drugs, reassurance, and referrals). Principal Findings. Before March 2020, most patients were female (75 percent) and 18-44 years old (89 percent). Common complaints such as abdominal pain, dysuria, or sore throat suggested minor acute conditions. Most cases (67 percent) were resolved remotely, mainly via prescriptions; a minority were referred. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a sharp (fourfold) increase in case volume, including more males (from 25 to 29 percent), patients aged 45 and older (from 11 to 17 percent), and more cases involving mental health complaints and complaints related to COVID-19. Across all symptoms, significantly more cases (78 percent) have been resolved remotely. Conclusions. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has been associated with a sharp increase in the use of chat-based telemedicine services, including by new patient demographics, an increase in both COVID-19 and mental health complains, and an increase in remote case resolutions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Zeltzer","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Alina Vodonos Zilberg","author_inst":"K Health, Tel Aviv"},{"author_name":"Yehuda Edo Paz","author_inst":"K Health, New York"},{"author_name":"Roy Malka","author_inst":"K Health, Tel Aviv"},{"author_name":"Gregory R Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C Nunez","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Jamie A Cohen","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Romesh G Abeysuriya","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren George","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Brittany Hagedorn","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Michal Jastrzebski","author_inst":"GitHub, Inc."},{"author_name":"Meaghan Fagalde","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle and King County"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Duchin","author_inst":"Public Health - Seattle and King County"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.14.20153908","rel_title":"Application of ARIMA and Holt-Winters forecasting model to predict the spreading of COVID-19 for India and its states","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.14.20153908","rel_abs":"The novel Corona-virus (COVID-2019) epidemic has posed a global threat to human life and society.

However, using these models in medical computer vision tasks suffers from several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations for COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution benefits from (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance compared to individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages to validate our claims; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods.

Here we review our experience using SARS-CoV-2 culture to determine infectivity and safe de-isolation of COVID-19 patients. Methods 195 patients with diverse severity of COVID-19 were tested (outpatients [n=178]), inpatients [n=12] and ICU [n=5]). SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were cultured in Vero C1008 cells and inspected daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE was confirmed by PCR of culture supernatant. Where no CPE was documented, PCR was performed on day four to confirm absence of virus replication. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of the day four PCR (Ctculture) and the PCR of the original clinical sample (Ctsample) were compared, and positive cultures were defined as a Ctsample - Ctculture value of greater than or equal to 3. Findings Of 234 samples collected, 228 (97%) were from the upper respiratory tract.

Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis adjusting for numerous potential confounders. We used a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score.

Critical unanswered questions remain about the timing of relaxation, and if and how unregulated social distancing measures can be sustained while effectively maintaining epidemic control. Methods: We identified all statewide social distancing measures that were implemented and\/or relaxed in the U.S. between March 10-July 15, 2020, triangulating data from state government and third-party sources. Using segmented linear regression, we evaluated the extent to which social distancing measure relaxation affected epidemic control, as indicated by the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (R[t]). Results: In the eight weeks prior to relaxation, mean R[t] declined by 0.012 units per day (95% CI, -0.013 to -0.012), and 46\/51 jurisdictions achieved R[t] < 1.0 by the date of relaxation. After relaxation of social distancing, R[t] reversed course and began increasing by 0.007 units per day (95% CI, 0.006-0.007), reaching a mean R[t] of 1.16 eight weeks later, with only 9\/51 jurisdictions maintaining R[t] <1.0. Indicators often used to motivate relaxation at the time of relaxation (e.g. test positivity rate <5%) predicted greater post-relaxation epidemic growth.

However, these are expensive and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside internal controls that monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost.

be a possible risk factor for COVID-19 disease in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the causality as well as the role of body fat distribution in this context still unclear. Thus, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated the causal impact of obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Methods Obesity was quantified by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these anthropometric measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium (Locke et al. (n=322154); Shungin et al. (n=232101)) and for the COVID-19 susceptibility (n=1079768) as well as hospitalization (n = 900687) from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Causal estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques. Results Genetically predicted BMI was significantly associated (per one SD) with both, COVID-19 susceptibility (OR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.72; P-value=0.001) and hospitalization (OR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.19 - 2.14; P-value=0.006). WC was associated with the susceptibility (OR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.78; P-value=0.015) but not with hospitalization. WHR was not associated with any of the COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions This study provides evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a risk group. Future research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking obesity with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dennis Freuer","author_inst":"1:\tChair of

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in admissions with cardiovascular (CV) emergencies. The fatal consequences of this are unknown. Objectives - To describe the place and causes of acute CV death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design - Retrospective nationwide cohort. Setting - England and Wales. Participants - All adult (age [&ge;]18 years) acute CV deaths (n=580,972) between 1st January 2014 and 2nd June 2020. Exposure - The COVID-19 pandemic (defined as from the onset of the first COVID-19 death in England on 2nd March 2020). Main outcomes - Place (hospital, care home, home) and acute CV events directly contributing to death as stated on the first part of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Results - After 2nd March 2020, there were 22,820 acute CV deaths of which 5.7% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute CV mortality of 1752 (+8%) compared with the expected daily deaths in the same period. Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Care homes had the greatest increase in excess acute CV deaths (1065, +40%), followed by deaths at home (1728, +34%) and in hospital (57, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute CV death during this period was stroke (8,290, 36.3%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (5,532, 24.2%), heart failure (5,280, 23.1%), pulmonary embolism (2,067, 9.1%) and cardiac arrest (1,037, 4.5%). Deep vein thrombosis had the greatest increase in cause of excess acute CV death (18, +25%), followed pulmonary embolism (340, +19%) and stroke (782, +10%). The greatest cause of excess CV death in care homes was stroke (700, +48%), compared with cardiac arrest (80, +56%) at home, and pulmonary embolism (126, +14%) and cardiogenic shock (41, +14%) in hospital. Conclusions and relevance - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute CV deaths above that expected for the time of year, nearly half of which occurred in the community. The most common cause of acute CV death was stroke followed by acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. This is key information to optimise messaging to the public and enable health resource planning.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Mohamed","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Chun Shing Kwok","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Chris Roebuck","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"ONS"},{"author_name":"Tom Denwood","author_inst":"NHS Digital"},{"author_name":"Tom Luescher","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Mark De Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"John Deanfield","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Chris Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Elias T Friman","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Toby Hurd","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Edward J Jarman","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Frederic Lee Mow Chee","author_inst":"Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline K Rainger","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Marion Walker","author_inst":"Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Camilla Drake","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Dasa Longman","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Mordstein","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sophie J Warlow","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Stewart McKay","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Louise Slater","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Morad Ansari","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Ian PM Tomlinson","author_inst":"Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.14.20153858","rel_title":"Community-level SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey in urban slum dwellers of Buenos Aires City, Argentina: a participatory research.","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.14.20153858","rel_abs":"Background By July 1st, the incidence rate of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.9% in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City. This study aimed to establish the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 three months after the first case was reported. Methods Between June 10th and July 1st, a cross-sectional design was carried out on people over 14 years old, selected from a probabilistic sample of households. A finger prick sample was tested by ELISA to detect IgG-class antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Multilevel model was applied to understand sector, household and individual conditions associated with seroconvert. Results Prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95%IC 52.8% to 54.1%). Among the IgG positive cases, 15% reported having compatible symptoms at some point in the past two months. There is evidence of within-household clustering effect (rho=0.52; 95% IC 0.36-0.67); living with a PCR-confirmed case doubled the chance of being SARS-CoV2 IgG positive (OR 2.13; 95% IC 1.17-3.85). The highest risk of infection was found in one of the most deprived areas of the slum, the Bajo autopista sector. Discussion High seroprevalence is shown, for each symptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed diagnosis, 9 people were IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probable asymptomatic) infections. Given that transmission among family members is a leading driver of the disease`s spread, it is unsurprising that crowded housing situations in slums are directly associated with higher risk of infection and consequently high seroprevalence levels. This study contributes to the understanding of population immunity against SARS-CoV2, its relation to living conditions and viral spread, for future decision making.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvana Figar","author_inst":"Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Vanina Pagotto","author_inst":"Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Lorena Luna","author_inst":"Salud Comunitaria, Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Julieta Salto","author_inst":"Salud Comunitaria, Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Wagner Manslau","author_inst":"Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Mistchenko","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia, Hospital de Ni\u00f1os Dr R.

We have created a Shiny\/R web application with user-selectable features: open data sources with daily COVID-19 incidences from all countries and many regions, customizable preprocessing options (smoothing, proportional increment, backwards distribution of negative corrections, etc), different MonteCarlo-Markov-Chain estimates of the generation time or serial interval distributions and state-of-the-art Rt estimation frameworks (EpiEstim, R0). We have analyzed the impact of these factors in the obtained transmission curves. We also have obtained curves at the national and sub-national level and analyzed the impact of epidemic control strategies, superspreading events, socioeconomic factors and outbreaks. We conclude that country wealth and, to a lesser extent, mitigation strategies, were associated with poorer epidemic control. Dataset quality was an important factor, and sometimes dictated the necessity of time series smoothing. We couldn't find conclusive evidence regarding the impact of alleged superspreading events. In the reopening phase, outbreaks had an impact on transmission curves.

44.5 [14.8] y), [&ge;] 18 y who were residing in the surveyed countries Main outcome measures: Stages of Change scale for exercise behaviour change, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short-form), World Health Organisation-5 Well-being Index and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9 Results: Participants who reported a negative change in exercise behaviour between pre- and during the early COVID-19 restrictions demonstrated poorer mental health and well-being compared to those who had either a positive change- or no change in their exercise behaviour (p<0.001). Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p<0.001).

However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS The North West Collaborative Organization for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR) performed a multi-centre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a two-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to hospital were recorded, including the CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across 7 hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in ICU. All scores underestimated mortality compared to their original validation in non-COVID-19 populations, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low risk' categories (CURB-65<2, NEWS2<5, qSOFA<2) 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION All existing prognostic scores evaluated here underestimated adverse outcomes and performed sub-optimally in the COVID-19 setting. New prognostic tools including a focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse are needed. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Freddy Frost","author_inst":"Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Patrick Bradley","author_inst":"Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kukatharmini Tharmaratnam","author_inst":"Department of Health Data Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR)","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Dan Gower Wootton","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Askew","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Claire Badenhorst","author_inst":"Massey University"},{"author_name":"Erin Byrd","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Maura Coulter","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Nick Draper","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Catherine Elliot","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"Simon Fryer","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hamlin","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154146","rel_title":"Seasonality of non-SARS, non-MERS Corona viruses and the impact of meteorological factors","rel_date":"2020-07-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154146","rel_abs":"Background: Seasonality is a characteristic of some respiratory viruses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the seasonality and the potential effects of different meteorological factors on the detection rate of the non-SARS Corona Virus detection by PCR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 12763 respiratory tract sample results (288 positive and 12475 negative) for non-SARS, non-MERS Corona viruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1). The effect of seven single weather factors on the Corona virus detection rate was fitted in a logistic regression model with and without adjusting for other weather factors. Results: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern peaking from December to March and plunging from July to September. The seasonal effect was less pronounced in immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent. Different automatic variable selection processes agreed to select the predictors temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover and precipitation as remaining predictors in the multivariable logistic regression model including all weather factors, with low ambient temperature, low relative humidity, high cloud cover and high precipitation being linked to increased Corona virus detection rates. Conclusions: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern, which was more pronounced in immunocompetent patients compared to immunosuppressed. Several meteorological factors were associated with the Corona virus detection rate. However, when mutually adjusting for all weather factors, only temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and cloud cover contributed independently to predicting the Corona virus detection rate.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olympia E Anastasiou","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anika Huesing","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Korth","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fotis Theodoropoulos","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, University Hospital of Essen - Ruhrlandklinik, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Taube","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, University Hospital of Essen - Ruhrlandklinik, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Karl-Heinz Joeckel","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Studies (ZKSE), Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical Faculty, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maura Coulter","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Nick Draper","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Catherine Elliot","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"Simon Fryer","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hamlin","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20151985","rel_title":"Size Dependent Particle Removal Efficiency and Pressure Drop of a Dust Cleaning Material For Use as Facemask Filters for Protection during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20151985","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe demand for facemasks, and this has resulted in the use of those made from alternate media.

Hence an objective severity assessment is crucial in making therapeutic decisions judiciously. Computed Tomography (CT)-scans can provide demarcating features to identify the severity of pneumonia, commonly associated with COVID-19, in the affected lungs. Here, a semi-quantitative severity assessing lung CT image feature is demonstrated for COVID-19 patients. An open-source multi-center Italian database was used, among which 61 cases were incorporated in the study (age 27-86, 71% males) from 27 CT imaging centers. Lesions in the form of opacifications, crazy-paving patterns, and consolidations were heuristically marked and the severity determining feature L_norm was quantified and established to be statistically distinct for the three classes i.e., mild, moderate, and severe (p-value < 0.0001). The thresholds of L_norm for a 3-class classification were determined based on the optimum sensitivity\/specificity combination from ROC analyses. The feature L_norm classified the cases in the three severity categories with 89.34% accuracy when L_norm was calculated based on experts' heuristic annotations. Substantial to almost-perfect intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were achieved involving expert and non-expert based evaluations ({kappa}-score 0.79-0.97). We trained machine learning based classification models and showed L_norm alone has a superior diagnostic accuracy over standard image intensity and texture features. Classification accuracy was further increased when L_norm was used to delineate the severe cases from non-severe ones (98.9%) with high sensitivity (97.7%), and specificity (97.49%). Therefore, key highlights of this severity assessment feature are accuracy, lower dependency on expert availability, and wide utility across multiple imaging centers.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biswajoy Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Kumar","author_inst":"Bengal School of Technology, West Bengal"},{"author_name":"Anup K Sadhu","author_inst":"EKO CT and MRI Scan Centre, Medical College and Hospitals Campus, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Nirmalya Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagur"},{"author_name":"Pabitra Mitra","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagur"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmoy Chatterjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagur"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stang","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maura Coulter","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Nick Draper","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Catherine Elliot","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"Simon Fryer","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Michael J Hamlin","author_inst":"Lincoln University"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20153130","rel_title":"Asthma in COVID-19: An extra chain fitting around the neck?","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20153130","rel_abs":"Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources. The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% vs 54.2%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3% vs 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1{+\/-}12.5 vs 11.5{+\/-}10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Hosny Hussein","author_inst":"Division of Endocrine and Oncologic Surgery, Department of Surgery,

pandemic. We report rapid early detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), comparing it to the serostatus of convalescent infection, at an Austrian National Sentinel Surveillance Practice in an isolated ski-resort serving a population of 22,829 people. Methods Retrospective dataset of all 73 patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to a sentinel practice in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein, Austria, between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. We split the outbreak in two halves, by dividing the period from the first to the last case by two, to characterise the following three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: people with reactive RT-PCR presenting during the first half (early acute infection) vs. those presenting in the second half (late acute), and people with non-reactive RT-PCR (late convalescent). For each cohort we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-PCR and the duration of symptoms. We also report multivariate regression of 15 clinical symptoms as covariates, comparing all people with convalescent infection to those with acute infection. Findings All 73 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7 presenting late acute and 7 late convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2 negative, and 7 were excluded. RT-PCR sensitivity was high (100%) among acute presenters, but dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak; specificity was 100%. The mean duration of symptoms was 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, and 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8 days (2-12) among late convalescent presenters respectively. Convalescent infection was only associated with loss of taste (ORs=6.02;p=0.047). Acute infection was associated with loss of taste (OR=571.72;p=0.029), nausea and vomiting (OR=370.11;p=0.018), breathlessness (OR=134.46;p=0.049), and myalgia (OR=121.82;p=0.032); but not loss of smell, fever or cough. Interpretation RT-PCR rapidly and reliably detects early COVID-19 among people presenting with viral illness and multiple symptoms in primary care, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak. RT-PCR testing in primary care should be prioritised for effective COVID-19 prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Werner Leber","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Lammel","author_inst":"Practice Dr. Lammel, Ramsau am Dachstein, Austria"},{"author_name":"Monika Redlberger-Fritz","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Maria Elisabeth Mustafa-Korninger","author_inst":"Medizinisch-chemisches Labor Dr. Mustafa, Dr. Richter OG, Salzburg, Austria"},{"author_name":"Karin Stiasny","author_inst":"Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Reingard Christina Glehr","author_inst":"Institute of General Practice and Evidence-based Health Services Research, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria"},{"author_name":"Eva-Maria Hochstrasser","author_inst":"Practice Dr. Lammel, Ramsau am Dachstein, Austria"},{"author_name":"Christian Hoellinger","author_inst":"Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siebenhofer","author_inst":"Institute of General Practice and Evidence-based Health Services Research, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria and Institute of General Practice, Goethe-U"},{"author_name":"Chris Griffiths","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Juan Duchesne","author_inst":"Trauma\/Acute Care and Critical Care, Department of Surgery, Tulane, Tulane School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA"},{"author_name":"Emad Kandil","author_inst":"Division of Endocrine and Oncologic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Tulane University, School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, USA"},{"author_name":"John Jakeman","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Kelly A Mackintosh","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Melitta A McNarry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mitchelmore","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"John Murphy","author_inst":"Dublin City University"},{"author_name":"Helen Ryan-Stewart","author_inst":"University of Winchester"},{"author_name":"Zoe Saynor","author_inst":"University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Mia Schaumberg","author_inst":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"author_name":"Keeron Stone","author_inst":"University of Gloucestershire"},{"author_name":"Lee Stoner","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Beth Stuart","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Danielle Lambrick","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Moore","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, The South East of Scotland Clinical Genetic Service"},{"author_name":"Nadine Wilkinson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"NHS Lothian, Medical Microbiology and Virology Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christine Tait-Burkard","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J\u00fcrgen G Haas","author_inst":"Division of Infection Medicine, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nick Gilbert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ian R Adams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Jackson","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20153064","rel_title":"Differences by country-level income in COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, and rates per million population in the first five months of the pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20153064","rel_abs":"Abstract Objective: To describe differences by country-level income in COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, incidence rates, and death rates per million population. Methods: Publicly available data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from December 31, 2019 to June 3, 2020 were analyzed. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine associations of country-level income with COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, incidence rates, and death rates. Results: A total of 380,803 deaths out of 6,348,204 COVID-19 cases were reported from 210 countries and territories globally in the period under study, and the global case-fatality rate was 6.0%. Of the total globally reported cases and deaths, the percentages of cases and deaths were 59.9% and 75.0% for high-income countries, and 30.9% and 20.7% for upper-middle-income countries. Countries in higher-income categories had higher incidence rates and death rates. Between April and May, the incidence rates in higher-income groups of countries decreased, but in other groups, it increased. Conclusions In the first five months of the COVID-19 pandemic, most cases and deaths were reported from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and those countries had higher incidence rates and death rates per million population than did lower-middle and low-income countries.
