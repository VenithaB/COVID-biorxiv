At present, estimates for the CFR of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection vary considerably. Expert consensus of 0.1-1% covers in practical terms a range from normal seasonable Influenza to Spanish Influenza. In the following, I deduce a formula for an adjusted Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) to assess mortality in a period following a positive test adjusted for selection bias. Official datasets on cases and deaths were combined with data sets on number of tests. After data curation and quality control, a total of IFR (n=819) was calculated for 21 countries for periods of up to 26 days between registration of a case and death. Estimates for IRFs increased with length of period, but levelled off at >9days with a median for all 21 countries of 0.11 (95%-CI: 0.073-0.15). An epidemiologically derived IFR of 0.040 % (95%-CI: 0.029%-0.055%) was determined for Iceland and was very close to the calculated IFR of 0.057% (95%-CI: 0.042-0.078), but 2.7-6-fold lower than CFRs. IFRs, but not CFRs, were positively associated with increased proportions of elderly in age-cohorts (n=21, spearman's {rho} =.73, p =.02). Real-time data on molecular and serological testing may further displace classical diagnosis of disease and its related death. I will critically discuss, why, how and under which conditions the IFR, provides a more solid early estimate of the global burden of a pandemic than the CFR.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Perikles Simon","author_inst":"Johannes Gutenberg-University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057638","rel_title":"Purely data-driven exploration of COVID-19 pandemic after three months of the outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057638","rel_abs":"It has been three months since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak.

Recent studies suggest that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could be effective against COVID-19. It is reasonable to expect that if HCQ can prevent or reduce the adverse effects of influenza, it may also reduce the effects of COVID-19 in humans. The objective of this study was to test whether HCQ can prevent or reduce the risk and severity of influenza. Methods. This is an observational cohort study using medico-administrative data from Quebec. Patients included had at least one emergency department (ED) visit in 2012 or 2013, with a prior diagnosis of chronic conditions, and were admissible to the public drug insurance plan. Two sub-cohorts were considered depending on reasons for ED visit: other than influenza or pneumonia (primary prevention) and influenza or pneumonia (secondary prevention). Results. In the primary prevention analysis (n=417,353), patients taking HCQ (n=3,659) had an increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia in the following year compared to those who did not (5.2% vs. 2.9%; adjusted OR=1.25, p=0.0079). In the secondary prevention analysis (n=27,152), patients taking HCQ (n=392), compared to those who did not had a modest and non-significant increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia after 30 days (25.8% vs. 22.6%; adjusted OR=1.14, p=0.3177). Interpretation: Based on the assumption that HCQ has similar effects on the COVID-19 as those observed on influenza, we can infer that it will not have positive effects on COVID-19. We should therefore act cautiously before initiating prospective interventional studies on the use of HCQ to reduce adverse effects of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alain Vanasse","author_inst":"Department of family medicine and emergency medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke"},{"author_name":"Josiane Courteau","author_inst":"PRIMUS Research Group, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CRCHUS)"},{"author_name":"Yohann Chiu","author_inst":"Department of family medicine and emergency medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke"},{"author_name":"Andre Cantin","author_inst":"Respiratory service, Medicine Department, Universite de Sherbrooke"},{"author_name":"Richard Leduc","author_inst":"Department of pharmacology-physiology, Universite de Sherbrooke"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20049924","rel_title":"Temporal Association Between Particulate Matter Pollution and Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20049924","rel_abs":"none","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ye Yao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Jinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Zhixi Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Xia Meng","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Weidong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Haidong Kan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Weibing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.033522","rel_title":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) envelope (E) protein harbors a conserved BH3-like motif","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.033522","rel_abs":"Disclaimer textThe authors have withdrawn their manuscript whilst they perform additional experiments to test some of their conclusions further.

Italy, the Western country with most COVID-19 related deaths, was the first to implement drastic containment measures in early March, 2020. Since then most other European countries, the USA, Canada and Australia, have implemented similar restrictions, ranging from school closures, banning of recreational activities and large events, to complete lockdown. Such limitations, and softer promotion of social distancing, may be more effective in one society than in another due to cultural or political differences. It is therefore important to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives by analyzing country-specific COVID-19 data. We propose to model COVID-19 dynamics with a SIQR (susceptible - infectious - quarantined - recovered) model, since confirmed positive cases are isolated and do not transmit the disease. We provide an explicit formula that is easily implemented and permits us to fit official COVID-19 data in a series of Western countries. We found excellent agreement with data-driven estimation of the day-of-change in disease dynamics and the dates when official interventions were introduced. Our analysis predicts that for most countries only the more drastic restrictions have reduced virus spreading. Further, we predict that the number of unidentified COVID-19-positive individuals at the beginning of the epidemic is [~]10 times the number of confirmed cases. Our results provide important insight for future planning of non-pharmacological interventions aiming to contain spreading of COVID-19 and similar diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morten Gram Pedersen","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Padova"},{"author_name":"Matteo Meneghini","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Liu","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Pengyao Wu","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Haidong Kan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Weibing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.031963","rel_title":"BioLaboro: A bioinformatics system for detecting molecular assay signature erosion and designing new assays in response to emerging and reemerging pathogens","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.031963","rel_abs":"BackgroundEmerging and reemerging infectious diseases such as the novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19 and Ebola pose a significant threat to global society and test the public health communitys preparedness to rapidly respond to an outbreak with effective diagnostics and therapeutics. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned or newly designed assays.\n\nResultsHere we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer\/probe sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene. Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors.\n\nConclusionsHere we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics experience.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mitchell Holland","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Daniel Negron","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Shane Mitchell","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Nate Dellinger","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Mychal Ivancich","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Tyler Barrus","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Sterling Thomas","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Katharine W Jennings","author_inst":"Noblis"},{"author_name":"Bruce G Goodwin","author_inst":"DBPAO, CBRND-EB, JPEO"},{"author_name":"Shanmuga Sozhamannan","author_inst":"CBRND-Enabling Biotechnologies, JPEO"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20057117","rel_title":"Global access to handwashing: implications for COVID-19 control in low-income countries","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20057117","rel_abs":"Background: Low-income countries have reduced health care system capacity and are therefore at risk of substantially higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than those currently seen in high-income countries. Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and handwashing access is limited. Objectives: To estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019. Results: Despite overall improvements from 1990 (34.7% [95% uncertainty interval 32.5-36.7] without access) to 2019 globally, in 2019, 2.01 (1.89-2.13) billion people equal to 26.0% (24.4-27.6) of the global population lacked access to handwashing. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa were without access to handwashing in 2019, while in eight countries, more than 50 million persons lacked access.

In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal\/mol ({+\/-} 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as -82.0 kcal\/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of -52.2 kcal\/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Desautels","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Adam Zemla","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Edmond Lau","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Franco","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Daniel Faissol","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Andre Poirier","author_inst":"Centre de sante et de services sociaux de Trois-Rivieres"},{"author_name":"Hugo Germain","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res"},{"author_name":"Alexis Danylo","author_inst":"Centre Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 Universitaire de sant\u00e9 et services sociaux de la Mauricie et Centre du Qu\u00e9bec"},{"author_name":"Bruce G Goodwin","author_inst":"DBPAO, CBRND-EB, JPEO"},{"author_name":"Shanmuga Sozhamannan","author_inst":"CBRND-Enabling Biotechnologies, JPEO"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20057356","rel_title":"The Immediate Effect of COVID-19 Policies on Social Distancing Behavior in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20057356","rel_abs":"Anecdotal evidence points to the effectiveness of COVID-19 social distancing policies, however, their effectiveness vis-a-vis what is driven by public awareness and voluntary actions have not been studied.

However, most were not echoed by the patients clinical manifestations, largely due to the lack of protein expression information of ACE2 and co-factors. Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages, then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid. Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses may not readily reach. Actually, the stomach may constitute a physical barrier against SARS-CoV-2 as the acidic environment in normal stomach (pH < 2.0) could completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viruses. These findings are in concert with the clinical characteristics of prominent lung symptoms, frequent heart injury, and uncommon intestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on the potential SARS-CoV-2 targets by pscRNA profiling, and propose that, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, attentions should also be paid to the potential injuries in cardiovascular, endocrine and reproductive systems during the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lulin Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, 20 Dongda Street, Beijing 100071, P.R.

To date, this outbreak has infected more than one million people and killed over fifty thousand people across the world. In most countries, the COVID-19 incidence curve rises sharply in a short span of time, suggesting a transition from a disease free (or low-burden disease) equilibrium state to a sustained infected (or high-burden disease) state. Such a transition from one stable state to another state in a relatively short span of time is often termed as a critical transition. Critical transitions can be, in general, successfully forecasted using many statistical measures such as return rate, variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Here, we report an empirical test of this forecasting on the COVID-19 data sets for nine countries including India, China and the United States. For most of the data sets, an increase in autocorrelation and a decrease in return rate predict the onset of a critical transition. Our analysis suggests two key features in predicting the COVID-19 incidence curve for a specific country: a) the timing of strict social distancing and\/or lockdown interventions implemented, and b) the fraction of a nation's population being affected by COVID-19 at the time of implementation of these interventions. Further, using satellite data of nitrogen dioxide which is emitted predominantly as a result of anthropogenic activities, as an indicator of lockdown policy, we find that in countries where the lockdown was implemented early and strictly have been successful in reducing the extent of transmission of the virus. These results hold important implications for designing effective strategies to control the spread of infectious pandemics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taranjot Kaur","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Sukanta Sarkar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Sourangsu Chowdhury","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, 55128 Mainz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sudipta Kumar Sinha","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Mohit Kumar Jolly","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Partha Sharathi Dutta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Ropar"},{"author_name":"Yichao Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, 20 Dongda Street, Beijing 100071, P.R.

It is a highly contagious positive strand RNA virus and its clinical presentation includes severe to critical respiratory disease that appears to be fatal in [~]3-5% of the cases. The viral spike (S) coat protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) cell surface protein to invade the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has acquired mutations that increase its affinity to human ACE2 by [~]10-15-fold compared to SARS-CoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. In this study, we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms might alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting the ACE2 S-protein interaction. Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that included over 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants, some of which mapped to the S-protein-interacting ACE2 surface. Using recently reported structural data and a recent S-protein-interacting synthetic mutant map of ACE2, we have identified natural ACE2 variants that are predicted to alter the virus-host interaction and thereby potentially alter host susceptibility. In particular, human ACE2 variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R are predicted to increase susceptibility. The T92I variant, part of a consensus NxS\/T N-glycosylation motif, confirmed the role of N90 glycosylation in immunity from non-human CoVs. Other ACE2 variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y are putative protective variants predicted to show decreased binding to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. Overall, ACE2 variants are rare, consistent with the lack of selection pressure given the recent history of SARS-CoV epidemics, however, are likely to play an important role in altering susceptibility to CoVs.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric W Stawiski","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Devan Diwanji","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA and Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Un"},{"author_name":"Kushal Suryamohan","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Ravi Gupta","author_inst":"MedGenome Labs Ltd., 3rd Floor, Narayana Netralaya Building, Narayana Health City, #258\/A, Bommasandra, Hosur Road, Bangalore, Karnataka 560099, India"},{"author_name":"Frederic A Fellouse","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, Accelerator for Donnelly Collaboration, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada"},{"author_name":"Fah Sathirapongsasuti","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiang Liu","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Ying-Ping Jiang","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Aakrosh Ratan","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA"},{"author_name":"Monika Mis","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Devi Santhosh","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Sneha Somasekar","author_inst":"Midwestern University, Glendale, AZ 85308, USA"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Mohan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Sameer Phalke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Boney Kuriakose","author_inst":"AgriGenome Labs Private Ltd, Kochi, Kerala 682030, India"},{"author_name":"Aju Antony","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Jagath R Junutula","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 348 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404"},{"author_name":"Stephan C Schuster","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637551, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Natalia Jura","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA and Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Un"},{"author_name":"Somasekar Seshagiri","author_inst":"SciGenom Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020, India; ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055244","rel_title":"Data model to predict prevalence of COVID-19 in Pakistan","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055244","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has spread to 181 countries and regions and leaving behind 1,133,788 confirmed cases and 62784 deaths worldwide.

For future expected numbers of cases for long terms the data collection have to be maintained in real time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Qasim","author_inst":"University of Otago"},{"author_name":"Waqas Ahmad","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University Of Otago, Dunedin, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand."},{"author_name":"Shenghuan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University Of Otago, Dunedin, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Yasir","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University Of Otago, Dunedin, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Azhar","author_inst":"Department of Education, Islamic International University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Fah Sathirapongsasuti","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiang Liu","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Ying-Ping Jiang","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Aakrosh Ratan","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA"},{"author_name":"Monika Mis","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Devi Santhosh","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"},{"author_name":"Sneha Somasekar","author_inst":"Midwestern University, Glendale, AZ 85308, USA"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Mohan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Sameer Phalke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Boney Kuriakose","author_inst":"AgriGenome Labs Private Ltd, Kochi, Kerala 682030, India"},{"author_name":"Aju Antony","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology, SciGenom Labs Pvt Ltd, Kerala 682037, India"},{"author_name":"Jagath R Junutula","author_inst":"ModMab Therapeutics, 348 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404"},{"author_name":"Stephan C Schuster","author_inst":"Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637551, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Natalia Jura","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA and Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Un"},{"author_name":"Somasekar Seshagiri","author_inst":"SciGenom Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020, India; ModMab Therapeutics, 384 Hatch Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.028688","rel_title":"Nonmedical Masks in Public for Respiratory Pandemics: Droplet Retention by two-layer Textile Barrier Fully Protects Germ-free Mice from Bacteria in Droplets","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.028688","rel_abs":"Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, we recently demonstrated that household textiles are effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs) with identical droplet retention potential as medical masks. To further promote the implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution based on a synchronized encouragement\/enforcement of mask utilization by the public based on widely available textiles (mask fabrication without the need for sewing machines), here we conducted a study using germ-free mice to determine to what extent textiles were effective in vivo. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which 100% cotton textile prevented the contamination of germ-free animals on the other side of the textile-barrier (simulating a properly worn mask). Of relevance, all mice protected with textiles remained germ-free after two sprays (inoculation dose: >600 bacterial droplet units per 56.75cm2) compared to the contamination of mice not protected by a textile (0\/12 vs 6\/6, Fishers exact, p<0.0001). In a second phase of the experiment with 12 germ-free mice exposed again to 10-fold more droplets remained germ-free, while 100% of mice at 180cm became colonized with a single spray (0\/8 vs 4\/4, Fisher exact, p=0.002). Collectively, barriers protected all mice (even with low-density textiles, heavy vs. light fabric, T-test, p=0.0028) when using textile-EDB to cover the cages (0\/20 vs 10\/10, Fisher exact, p<0.0001).

This study uses a rapid review approach and investigates evidence from previous epidemic outbreaks to provide a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of key NPIs used by countries to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Understanding which cell types are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus, whether interspecies differences exist, and how variations in cell state influence viral entry is fundamental for accelerating therapeutic and preventative approaches. In this endeavor, we profiled the transcriptome of nine tissues from a Macaca fascicularis monkey at single-cell resolution. The distribution of SARS-CoV-2 facilitators, ACE2 and TMRPSS2, in different cell subtypes showed substantial heterogeneity across lung, kidney, and liver. Through co-expression analysis, we identified immunomodulatory proteins such as IDO2 and ANPEP as potential SARS-CoV-2 targets responsible for immune cell exhaustion. Furthermore, single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of the kidney unveiled a plausible link between IL6-mediated innate immune responses aiming to protect tissue and enhanced ACE2 expression that could promote viral entry.

It is noteworthy that the disease has its greatest impact on the elderly. Herein, we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination, specifically against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over SARS-CoV-2. We identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and measles and mumps viruses. Moreover, we also identified a 29% amino acid sequence homology between the Macro (ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase) domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus. The rubella Macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in MMR. Hence, we hypothesize that MMR could protect against poor outcome in COVID-19 infection. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we identified that 1) age groups that most likely lack of MMR vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in COVID-19, and 2) COVID-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres, potentially induced by SARS-CoV2 homologous sequences. We therefore propose that vaccination of at risk age groups with an MMR vaccination merits further consideration as a time-appropriate and safe intervention.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robin Franklin","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Adam Young","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bjoern Neumann","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rocio Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Joannides","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Amir Reyahi","author_inst":"Luton & Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Yorgo Modis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ying Lei","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Lai","author_inst":"Laboratory of Integrative biology, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, CAS, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Carl Ward","author_inst":"Laboratory of Integrative biology, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, CAS, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Yeya Yu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingyue Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Quan Shi","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ya Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Chunqing Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanhang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Haixi Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenkun Zhuang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Tingting Tang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yunting Huang","author_inst":"China National GeneBank, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, China"},{"author_name":"Haorong Lu","author_inst":"China National GeneBank, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, China"},{"author_name":"Liqin Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jiangshan Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mengnan Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Chi Wai Wong","author_inst":"Huazhen Biosciences, Guangzhou 510900, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Tan","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Weizhi Ji","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Patrick H.

Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available serological tests. These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests. The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or non-coronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The results showed 100% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90%, 90%, and 65%, respectively. The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics > Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech > Artron Laboratories > Acro Biotech [&ge;] Hangzhou Alltest Biotech. Overall, these findings will facilitate selection of serological assays for the detection SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as sero-epidemiological and vaccine development studies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ria Lassauni\u00e8re","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Frische","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Zitta B Harboe","author_inst":"Nordsjaellands Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Alex CY Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Fomsgaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Karen A Krogfelt","author_inst":"Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark and Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Charlotte S J\u00f8rgensen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Ying Lei","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Lai","author_inst":"Laboratory of Integrative biology, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, CAS, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Carl Ward","author_inst":"Laboratory of Integrative biology, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, CAS, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Yeya Yu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mingyue Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Quan Shi","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Ya Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Chunqing Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanhang Zhang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Haixi Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Yu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenkun Zhuang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Tingting Tang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yunting Huang","author_inst":"China National GeneBank, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, China"},{"author_name":"Haorong Lu","author_inst":"China National GeneBank, BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518120, China"},{"author_name":"Liqin Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jiangshan Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Mengnan Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Chi Wai Wong","author_inst":"Huazhen Biosciences, Guangzhou 510900, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Tan","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Weizhi Ji","author_inst":"Yunnan Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research, Institute of Primate Translational Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500,"},{"author_name":"Patrick H.

The expression data analysis of the Renin Angiotensin System indicates mild nasal, oral or throat infections are likely and that the gastrointestinal tissues are a common primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Extreme symptoms in the lower respiratory system likely result from a secondary-infection possibly by a comorbidity-driven upregulation of ACE2 in the lung. The remarkable differences in expression of other RAS elements, the elimination of macrophages and the activation of cytokines in COVID-19 bronchoalveolar samples suggest that a functional immune deficiency is a critical outcome of COVID-19.
