Among all therapeutic approaches, arguments have raised about hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis overcome the controversies regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar and medRxiv pre-print database using all available MeSH terms for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine up to July 19, 2020. Studies focused on the effectiveness of HCQ with\/without azithromycin (AZM) in confirmed COVID-19 patients were entered into the study. Two researchers have independently evaluated quality assessment of the studies and abstracted data for data extraction. Extracted data were analyzed using CMA v. 2.2.064. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared (I2) test, and fixed\/random-effects model was used when appropriate for pooling of studies. Results: Out of 26 studies entered into our systematic review, 21 studies including 14 comparative studies with control group and seven observational studies containing 103,486 participants have entered into the meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis on comparative studies indicated no significant clinical effectiveness (negative in RT-PCR evaluation) for HCQ regimen in the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to control group (RR: 1.03, 95% CI, 0.79-1.34). The same result was observed for the combination of HCQ+azithromycin (RR: 1.26, 95% CI, 0.91-1.74). No significant differences were found for both HCQ (RR: 0.92, 95% CI, 0.72-1.16) and HCQ+AZM (RR: 1.72, 95% CI, 0.86-3.42) mortality rate; however, mortality was affected by age differences according to meta-regression analysis (P<0.000001). No substantial difference was observed for disease exacerbation (RR: 1.23, 95% CI, 0.65-2.30) between HCQ group and controls. Also, radiological findings significantly improved in the HCQ group (OR: 0.32, 95% CI, 0.11-0.98). Odds of known HCQ adverse effects (diarrhea, vomiting, blurred vision, rash, headache, etc.) occurred in the HCQ regimen group was approximately 3.5 times of control group (OR: 3.40, 95% CI, 1.65-6.98), but no substantial differences were found regarding intubation odds between HCQ group and control group (OR: 2.11, 95% CI, 0.31-14.03). Meta-analysis indicated no significant prophylactic effects for HCQ (OR: 0.40, 95% CI, 0.04-3.65) Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed no clinical benefits regarding HCQ treatment with\/without azithromycin for COVID-19 patients. Although mortality rate was not significantly different between cases and controls, frequency of adverse effects was substantially higher in HCQ regimen group. However, due to that most of the studies were non-randomized and results were not homogenous, selection bias was unavoidable and further large randomized clinical trials following comprehensive meta-analysis should be taken into account in order to achieve more reliable findings. Also, it is worth mentioning that if this work does not allow to quantify a \"value\" of the HCQ, it allows at least to know what is not the HCQ and that it would be prudent not to continue investing in this direction.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir Shamshirian","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Keyvan Heydari","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Ebrahimzadeh","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"George W YIP","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Roya Ghasemian","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Meghdad Sedaghat","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hananeh Baradaran","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Mohammadi Yazdi","author_inst":"Kashan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Elham Aboufazeli","author_inst":"IRAN NAJO Pharmaceutical Company"},{"author_name":"Hamed Jafarpour","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Dadgostar","author_inst":"Halal research center of IRI"},{"author_name":"Behnaz Tirandazi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Keyvan Karimifar","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Aida Eftekhari","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20067157","rel_title":"Epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill adults with COVID-19 in New York City: a prospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20067157","rel_abs":"Background: Nearly 30,000 patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been hospitalized in New York City as of April 14th, 2020. Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed. Methods: We prospectively collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data on critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed-COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in northern Manhattan between March 2nd and April 1st, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal-replacement-therapy, and time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission. The relationship between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modeled using Cox-proportional-hazards regression. Each patient had at least 14 days of observation. Results: Of 1,150 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period, 257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR] 51-72); 170 (66%) were male. Two-hundred twelve (82%) had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (63%; 162\/257) and diabetes mellitus (36%; 92\/257). One-hundred-thirty-eight patients (54%) were obese, and 13 (5%) were healthcare workers. As of April 14th, 2020, in-hospital mortality was 33% (86\/257); 47% (122\/257) of patients remained hospitalized. Two-hundred-one (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (median 13 days [IQR 9-17]), and 54% (138\/257) and 29% (75\/257) required vasopressors and renal-replacement-therapy, respectively. The median time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission was 3 days (IQR 1-6). Older age, hypertension, chronic lung disease, and higher concentrations of interleukin-6 and d-dimer at admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Critical illness among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew J Cummings","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matthew R Baldwin","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Darryl Abrams","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Samuel D Jacobson","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Meyer","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Balough","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Justin G Aaron","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jan Claassen","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"LeRoy E Rabbani","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Hastie","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Beth R Hochman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"John Salazar-Schicchi","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Natalie H Yip","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Brodie","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Max R O'Donnell","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Aida Eftekhari","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20066860","rel_title":"TOWARD A COVID-19 SCORE-RISK ASSESSMENTS AND REGISTRY","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20066860","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Importance Critical care resources like ventilators, used to manage the current COVID-19 pandemic, are potentially inadequate. Established triage standards and guidelines may not contain the most appropriate severity assessment and outcome prediction models. Objectives Develop a draft pandemic specific triage assessment score for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Design a website where initial Toward a COVID-19 Scores (TACS) can be quickly calculated and used to compare various treatment strategies. Create a TACS Registry where data and outcomes for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients can be recorded. Use the TACS Registry to develop an influenza epidemic specific database and score for use in future respiratory based epidemics. Design, Setting, Participants Retrospective analysis of 3,301 ICU admissions with respiratory failure admitted to 41 U.S. Intensive Care Units from 2015-19. Independent external validation on 1,175 similar ICU Admissions using identical entry criteria from Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH), Washington University from 2016-2019. Main Outcomes TACS was created with 16 readily available predictive variables for risk assessment of hospital mortality 24 hours after ICU Admission and the need for prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation (PAMV) ( >>96 hours) at 24- and 48-hours post ICU admission. Results TACS achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for hospital mortality after 24 hours of 0.80 in the development dataset; 0.81 in the internal validation dataset. At a probability of 50% hospital mortality, positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.55, negative predictive value (NPV) 0.89; sensitivity 22%, specificity 97%. For PAMV after 24 hours, the AUC was 0.84 in the development dataset, 0.81 in the validation dataset. For PAMV after 48 hours, the AUC was 0.82 in the development dataset, 0.78 in the validation dataset. In the external validation the AUC for TACS was 0.76 +\/- 0.024. We launched a website that is scaled for mobile device use ( https:\/\/covid19score.azurewebsites.net\/) that provides open access to a user-friendly TACS Calculator for all predictions. We also designed a voluntary TACS Registry for collection of data and outcomes on ICU Admissions with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance Toward a COVID-19 score is a starting point for an epidemic specific triage assessment that could be used to evaluate various approaches to treatment. The TACS Registry provides the ability to establish a respiratory specific outcomes database that can be used to create a triage approach for future such pandemics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristina Vazquez Guillamet","author_inst":"Wasington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Vazquez Guillamet","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew A.

The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, comparing to the SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2 from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human\/rhesus monkey and rat\/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activity, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2 from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as primary receptor for host cell entry. Viral entry mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. We examined the receptor activity of 14 ACE2 orthologues and found that wild type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site in S protein could utilize ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells. These results have important implications in the natural hosts, interspecies transmission, animal models and molecular basis of receptor binding for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuesen Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Danying Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Robert Szabla","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Western University, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mei Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Guoli Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Du","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Shuangli Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Xinglin Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Chuan Song","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Rui Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Ju-Tao Guo","author_inst":"Baruch S.

Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in coronavirus entry into the host cells, as they provide host cell recognition and membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets. Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively. Starting from closed and open state crystal structures, and also 16 intermediate conformations, an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of explicit water and ions were performed. Simulations show that in its down position, RBD has significantly lower mobility compared to its up position; probably caused by the 6 interdomain salt bridges of RBD in down position compared to 3 in up position.

There are no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of this virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3g or 6 g per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc) confers complete protection in non-human primates against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide by eliciting potent humoral responses devoid of immunopathology","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Linlin Bao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Kangwei Xu","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Virus Vaccines, National Institute for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"minnan Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yajing Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nan Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhe Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqin Ge","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Biao Kan","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Yaling Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jiangning Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fang Cai","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Deyu Jiang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Gong","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiuyu Lou","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dongdong Wu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hengming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lang Zhu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yurong Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jinxing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Diseases"},{"author_name":"Changgui Li","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Virus Vaccines, National Institute for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weidong Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20060160","rel_title":"Patient-derived mutations impact pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20060160","rel_abs":"The sudden outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally with more than 1,300,000 patients diagnosed and a death toll of 70,000.

Here we report functional characterizations of 11 patient-derived viral isolates, all of which have at least one mutation. Importantly, these viral isolates show significant variation in cytopathic effects and viral load, up to 270-fold differences, when infecting Vero-E6 cells. We observed intrapersonal variation and 6 different mutations in the spike glycoprotein (S protein), including 2 different SNVs that led to the same missense mutation.

Here we propose a tailored dynamic model accounting for community-specific transmission controls and medical resource availability. We trained the model using data from Wuhan and applied it to other countries. We show that isolating suspected cases is most effective in reducing transmission rate if the intervention starts early. Having more hospital beds provides leverage that diminishes with delayed intervention onset. The importance of transmission control in turn increases by 65% with a 7-day delay. Furthermore, prolonging outbreak duration by applying an intermediate, rather than strict, transmission control would not prevent hospital overload regardless of bed capacity, and would likely result in a high ratio (21% ~ 84%) of the population being infected but not treated. The model could help different countries design control policies and gauge the severity of suppression failure.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Wei","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhengyang Wang","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Liang","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Quanying Liu","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Linfang Cheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Fumin Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Haibo Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Changzhong Jin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Min Zheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Z"},{"author_name":"Chao Jiang","author_inst":"Life Sciences Institute, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Lanjuan Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiangning Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fang Cai","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Deyu Jiang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Gong","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiuyu Lou","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dongdong Wu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hengming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lang Zhu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yurong Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jinxing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Diseases"},{"author_name":"Changgui Li","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Virus Vaccines, National Institute for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weidong Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20067652","rel_title":"Prevent the resurgence of infectious disease with asymptomatic carriers","rel_date":"2020-04-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20067652","rel_abs":"After reaching the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many regions are in search of a reopening plan that would minimize resurgence.

plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, but how health providers should advise families and parents to obtain health education information is a challenging question. With COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) spreading around the world, this rapid review aims to answer that question and thus to promote evidence-based decision making in health education policy and practice. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on health education during COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome) epidemics in Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CBM (China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Data from their inception until March 31, 2020. The potential bias of the studies was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool. Results: Of 1067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases. Health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites. Conclusions: For educating and cultivating children, parents should obtain information from the official websites of authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national Centers for Disease Control, or from other sources endorsed by these authorities, rather than from a general search of the internet or social media.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Liao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Qinyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyi Tang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"The First Clinical Medical College of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Deyu Jiang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Gong","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiuyu Lou","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dongdong Wu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hengming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lang Zhu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yurong Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jinxing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Diseases"},{"author_name":"Changgui Li","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Virus Vaccines, National Institute for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weidong Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20064378","rel_title":"Breastfeeding of Infants Born to Mothers with COVID-19: A Rapid Review","rel_date":"2020-04-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20064378","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Existing recommendations on whether mothers with COVID-19 should continue breastfeeding are still conflicting. We aimed to conduct a rapid review of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and preprint articles up to March 2020. We included studies relevant to transmission through milk and respiratory droplets during breastfeeding of mothers with COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results: A total of 4481 records were identified in our literature search. Six studies (five case reports and one case series) involving 58 mothers (16 mothers with COVID-19, 42 mothers with influenza) and their infants proved eligible. Five case reports showed that the viral nucleic acid tests for all thirteen collected samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 were negative. A case series of 42 influenza infected postpartum mothers taking precautions (hand hygiene and wearing masks) before breastfeeding showed that no neonates were infected with influenza during one-month of follow-up. Conclusions: The current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid has not been detected in breast milk.

Based on the publicly available contact-tracing data, we identified 337 transmission chains from 10 provinces in China and estimated the serial interval (SI) and generation interval (GI) of COVID-19 in China. Methods: Inspired by possibly different values of the time-varying reproduction number for the imported cases and the local cases in China, we divided all transmission events into three subsets: imported (the zeroth generation) infecting 1st-generation locals, 1st-generation locals infecting 2nd-generation locals, and others transmissions among 2+ generations. The corresponding SI (GI) is respectively denoted as $\\mbox{SI}^{0}_{1}$ ($\\mbox{GI}^{0}_{1}$), $\\mbox{SI}^{1}_{2}$ ($\\mbox{GI}^{1}_{2}$), and $\\mbox{SI}^{2+}_{3+}$ ($\\mbox{GI}^{2+}_{3+}$). A Bayesian approach with doubly interval-censored likelihood is employed to fit the lognormal, gamma, and Weibull distribution function of the SI and GI using the identified 337 transmission chains. Findings: It is found that the estimated $\\mbox{SI}^{0}_{1}$ = 6.27 (95%CI : 5.62 - 6.98), $\\mbox{SI}^{1}_{2}$ = 5.92 (95%CI : 5.27 - 6.66), $\\mbox{SI}^{2+}_{3+}$ = 4.36 (95%CI : 3.65 - 5.20), and $\\mbox{GI}^{0}_{1}$ = 8.15 (95%CI : 6.73 - 9.91), $\\mbox{GI}^{1}_{2}$ = 5.26 (95%CI : 4.25 - 6.69), $\\mbox{GI}^{2+}_{3+}$ = 3.85 (95%CI : 2.18 - 6.72), thus overall both SI and GI decrease when generation increases.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Menghui Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Science and Technology Information"},{"author_name":"Kai Liu","author_inst":"Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, P.

The number of deaths has increased with the increase in the number of infected patients. We aimed to develop a clinical model to predict the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients early. Methods Epidemiological, clinical, and first laboratory findings after admission of 183 severe COVID-19 patients (115 survivors and 68 nonsurvivors) from the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to develop the predictive models. Five machine learning approaches (logistic regression, partial least squares regression, elastic net, random forest, and bagged flexible discriminant analysis) were used to select the features and predict the patients' outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to compare the models' performance. Sixty-four severe COVID-19 patients from the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to externally validate the final predictive model. Results The baseline characteristics and laboratory tests were significantly different between the survivors and nonsurvivors. Four variables (age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer level) were selected by all five models. Given the similar performance among the models, the logistic regression model was selected as the final predictive model because of its simplicity and interpretability. The AUROCs of the derivation and external validation sets were 0.895 and 0.881, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.892 and 0.687 for the derivation set and 0.839 and 0.794 for the validation set, respectively, when using a probability of death of 50% as the cutoff. The individual risk score based on the four selected variables and the corresponding probability of death can serve as indexes to assess the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients. The predictive model is freely available at https:\/\/phenomics.fudan.edu.cn\/risk_scores\/. Conclusions Age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer level of COVID-19 patients at admission are informative for the patients' outcomes.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xingdong Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiu Liu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yukun Song","author_inst":"School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, P.

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2\/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (<0.1%) variants in 10\/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats. Utilized appropriately, our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joana Damas","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Graham M.

The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants. We present full sequence information and detailed protocols for the identified sybodies, as a freely accessible resource.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin D Walter","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Cedric A.J.

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of viral diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, Clinical Trials Registries, CNKI, Wanfang Data, CQVIP, and Preprint Servers through April 4, 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ against viral infection. We analyzed pooled data on the overall efficacy, the relative risks over the placebo, and the prevalence of adverse events. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was also performed to evaluate the random errors in the meta-analysis. Potential moderators of drug-placebo efficacy differences were analyzed by meta-regression. Results: The analysis included 11 RCTs with 2613 adult patients. Both the plasma viral load (standard mean difference: 0.29, 95% CI: -1.19 - 1.76, P = 0.70) and the improvement of clinical symptoms (odds ratio: 2.36, 95% CI: 0.81 - 6.92, P = 0.11) were not different between the intervention and placebo arm. There was significant heterogeneity for the efficacy assessment, which was primarily explained by the age of patients and the sample size. Compared to the placebo, CQ and HCQ had increased risk of mild adverse events (risk ratio: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.35 - 1.70, P < 0.05, TSA adjusted 95% CI: 1.31 - 2.19), which were statistically significant in nervous, integumentary, and gastrointestinal systems. The most common adverse events were observed in the nervous system, with the pooled prevalence of 31.4% (95% CI: 10.5% - 56.7%). Conclusions: Insufficient data were available to support the antiviral efficacy of CQ and HCQ due to the high heterogeneity caused by the age of patients. Mild side effects are expected for the current antiviral dose regimens of CQ and HCQ. Treatment outcomes may be enhanced by better-selected patients based on age and well-controlled adverse events.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Li Yu","author_inst":"Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kefeng Li","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Marianne Wyss","author_inst":"Division of Experimental and Clinical Research, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pascal Egloff","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich and Linkster Therapeutics AG, Zurich"},{"author_name":"Mich\u00e8le Sorgenfrei","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Lea M H\u00fcrlimann","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Imre Gonda","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Gianmarco Meier","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sille Remm","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sujani Thavarasah","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Philippe Plattet","author_inst":"Division of Experimental and Clinical Research, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Markus A Seeger","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Oliver A.

Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries (\"margination\"). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure-dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob W Myerson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Priyal N Patel","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Nahal Habibi","author_inst":"University of Michigan at Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Landis R Walsh","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Yi-Wei Lee","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts at Amherst"},{"author_name":"David C Luther","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts at Amherst"},{"author_name":"Laura T Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Michael H Zaleski","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Marco E Zamora","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Oscar A.

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largely remained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In the present study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that bat-SARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The protein sequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher as compared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutations in the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acid changes. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The non-synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed over different hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important diamino acid change RG to KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novel coronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruses which may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behind failure of the antiviral therapies.\n\nSummaryThis study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. This analysis will provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manish Tiwari","author_inst":"National Institute of Plant Genome Research"},{"author_name":"Divya Mishra","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Nahal Habibi","author_inst":"University of Michigan at Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Landis R Walsh","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Yi-Wei Lee","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts at Amherst"},{"author_name":"David C Luther","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts at Amherst"},{"author_name":"Laura T Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Michael H Zaleski","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Marco E Zamora","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Oscar A.

In this report we used a recently-developed bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. We recapitulate known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that the SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a huge reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Our results also predict regions that are accessible for intermolecular interactions, which can aid in the design of antisense therapeutics.

Therefore, the S protein presents a viable target to develop a directed therapy. Here, we deployed an integrated artificial intelligence with molecular dynamics simulation approach to provide new details of the S protein structure. Based on a comprehensive structural analysis of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and previous human coronaviruses, we found that the protomer state of S proteins is structurally flexible. Without the presence of a stabilizing beta sheet from another protomer chain, two regions in the S2 domain and the hinge connecting the S1 and S2 subunits lose their secondary structures. Interestingly, the region in the S2 domain was previously identified as an immunodominant site in the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We anticipate that the molecular details elucidated here will assist in effective therapeutic development for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Serena H Chen","author_inst":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"M.

With this aim we performed an in silico comparative modeling analysis, which allows to gain new insights about the main conformational changes occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, at the level of the receptor binding domain (RBD), along interactions with human cells angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, that favour human cell invasion. Furthermore, our analysis provides i) an ideal pipeline to identify already characterized antibodies that might target SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, for preventing interactions with the human ACE2, and ii) instructions for building new possible neutralizing antibodies, according to chemical\/physical space restraints and complementary determining regions (CDR) mutagenesis of the identified existing antibodies. The proposed antibodies show in silico a high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high affinity antibodies against present and future coronavirus able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with the human ACE2.

While the well-known poly-ADP-ribosylating (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many non-canonical mono-ADP-ribosylating (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust upregulation of several PARPs following infection with Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while downregulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+. Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD, and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Collin D Heer","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Sanderson","author_inst":"Oregon Health Sciences University"},{"author_name":"Lynden S Voth","author_inst":"University of Kansas"},{"author_name":"Yousef M.O.

Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Together our results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Abiola Senok","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rifat Hamoudi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Alheialy","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Michael S Cohen","author_inst":"Oregon Health Sciences University"},{"author_name":"Anthony R.

ACE2 is a receptor protein of SARS- CoV-2, and TMPRSS2 promotes virus proliferation and transmission. Some patients developed multiple organ dysfunction syndromes other than lungs. Therefore, studying the viral susceptibility of other organs is important for a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsThe advantage of scRNA-seq data is the identification of cell types by clustering the gene expression of cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in AT2 of lungs, we compared the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels of cell types from 31 organs, with AT2 of lungs to evaluate the risk of the viral infection using scRNA-seq data.\n\nFindingsFor the first time, we found the brain, gall bladder, and fallopian tube are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Besides, the nose, heart, small intestine, large intestine, esophagus, testis and kidney are also identified to be high-risk organs with high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, the susceptible organs are grouped into three risk levels based on the TMPRSS2 expression. As a result, the respiratory system, digestive system and reproductive system are at the top-risk level to COVID-19 infection.\n\nInterpretationThis study provides evidence for COVID-19 infection in the human nervous system, digestive system, reproductive system, respiratory system, circulatory system and urinary system using scRNA-seq data, which helps for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Qi","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhou","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiao Hua","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Liying Zhang","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jialin Bian","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Beibei Liu","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zicen Zhao","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuilin Jin","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Anthony R.

With the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is urgent to explore the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus. However, the foundational research of COVID-19 is very weak. Although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, information about SARS-CoV-2 invading airway epithelial cells is very limited. Based on the analysis of the Human Protein Atlas database, we compared the virus-related receptors of epithelial-derived cells from different organs and found potential key molecules in the local microenvironment for SARS-CoV-2 entering airway epithelial cells. In addition, we found that these proteins were associated with virus reactive proteins in host airway epithelial cells, which may promote the activation of the immune system and the release of inflammatory factors. Our findings provide a new research direction for understanding the potential microenvironment required by SARS-CoV-2 infection in airway epithelial, which may assist in the discovery of potential drug targets against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ling Leng","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Ma","author_inst":"National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing) , Beijing Institute of Life Omics"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Li Wei","author_inst":"National Engineering Research Center for the Emergency Drug, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"National Engineering Research Center for the Emergency Drug, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology"},{"author_name":"Yunping Zhu","author_inst":"National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing) , Beijing Institute of Life Omics"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Wu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ruiyuan Cao","author_inst":"National Engineering Research Center for the Emergency Drug, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology"},{"author_name":"Wu Zhong","author_inst":"National Engineering Research Center for the Emergency Drug, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology"},{"author_name":"Charles Brenner","author_inst":"City of Hope National Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Patrick M Glassman","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ian Johnston","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth D Hood","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Tea Shuvaeva","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jason V Gregory","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Raisa Y Kiseleva","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jia Nong","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kathryn M Rubey","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Colin F Greineder","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Samir Mitragotri","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"George S Worthen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Vincent M Rotello","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts at Amherst"},{"author_name":"Joerg Lahann","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Vladimir R Muzykantov","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jacob S Brenner","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Lang Zhu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Wei Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medicine Center, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yurong Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jinxing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Diseases"},{"author_name":"Changgui Li","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Virus Vaccines, National Institute for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weidong Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"contradictory results","category":"cell biology"}]}
