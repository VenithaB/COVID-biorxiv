Reasons for this disparity have not been well-characterized but may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors. Objective: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial\/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design: A retrospective cohort study with comparative control groups. Setting: Patients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Participants: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in\/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race\/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Results: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2%) and non-Hispanic Black\/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2% NHW and 37.4% NHAA; 44.8% hospitalized, 20.6% admitted to ICU, and 3.8% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization. Pre-existing kidney disease led to 2.55 times higher risk of hospitalization (95% CI, 1.62-4.02; P<.001) in the overall population and 11.9 times higher mortality risk in NHAA (95% CI, 2.2-64.7, P=.004). Conclusions and Relevance: Pre-existing type II diabetes\/kidney diseases and living in high population density areas were associated with high risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor prognosis. Association of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race. NHAA patients were disproportionately affected by obesity and kidney disease.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tian Gu","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jasmine A.

Methods: Between April 25th and May 23rd, we contacted 793 individuals aged 18 and older, who previously participated in studies conducted in the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Karonga District, Malawi. During an interview by mobile phone, we ascertained sources of information about COVID-19 and we evaluated knowledge of respondents about the transmission and course of SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19. We also asked them to evaluate their own risk of infection and severe illness. Finally, we inquired about the preventive measures they had adopted in response to the pandemic. We describe patterns of knowledge and behaviors among survey respondents, by area of residence (rural vs. urban). Results: We interviewed 630 respondents (79.5% response rate) which included 260 men and 370 women. Four hundred and eighty-nine respondents resided in rural areas (77.6%) and 141 resided in urban areas (22.4%). Only one respondent had never heard of COVID-19. Respondents reported on average 4 distinct sources of information about COVID-19. Misconceptions about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and about the course and severity of COVID-19, were common. For example, two thirds of respondents believed that everyone with COVID-19 would eventually become severely ill. Increased hand washing and avoiding crowds were the most reported strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Use of face masks was more common among urban residents (22.5%) than among rural residents (5.0%). Conclusion: Despite widespread access to information about the COVID-19 pandemic, gaps in knowledge about COVID-19 persist in this population. The adoption of preventive strategies remains limited, possibly due to limited perceived risk of infection among a large fraction of the population.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jethro Banda","author_inst":"Malawi Epidemiological and Intervention Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Albert Dube","author_inst":"Malawi Epidemiological and Intervention Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Sarah Brumfield","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Abena Amoah","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amelia Crampin","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Georges Reniers","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"St\u00e9phane Helleringer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kheterpal","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lynda Lisabeth","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lars G.

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequential supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated, that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS, using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity but the second cohort (n=227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either. Virus stability in saliva was also investigated, with and without the addition of commercially available stabilizing solutions. The virus was stable in saliva at both 4C and room temperature for up to 7 days. The addition of stabilizing solutions did not enhance stability and in some situations reduced detectable virus levels.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara B Griesemer","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Greta Van Slyke","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Dylan Ehrbar","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Klemen Strle","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Tugba Yildirim","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Dominick A Centurioni","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Anne C Walsh","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew K Chang","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael J Waxman","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Bhramar G.

Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted from March 10, 2020 to April 21, 2020 in admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19. Patients were included if [&ge;] 18 years old and admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Data was collected via chart review from the enterprise electronic health record database. Data collected include factors driving antibiotic choice, indication, and duration of therapy as well as microbiological data. Findings: Antibiotics were initiated on admission in 87\/147 (59%) patients. Of these, 85\/87 (98%) prescriptions were empiric. The most common indication for empiric antibiotics was concern for community-acquired pneumonia (76\/85, 89%) with the most prescribed antibiotics being ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was two days (interquartile range 1-5). No patients had a community-acquired bacterial respiratory coinfection, but 10\/147 (7%) of patients were found to have concurrent bacterial infections from a non-respiratory source, and one patient was diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of admission for COVID-19. Interpretation: Bacterial coinfection in patients with COVID-19 was infrequent. Antibiotics are likely unnecessary in patients with mild symptoms. There is little role for broad-spectrum antibiotics to empirically treat multidrug resistant organisms in patients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. Antimicrobial stewardship remains important in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenjing Wei","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Jessica K Ortwine","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Norman S Mang","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Christopher Joseph","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brenton C Hall","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Chase Prokesch","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Anne C Walsh","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew K Chang","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael J Waxman","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Bhramar G.

Africa is the last and least affected to date. However, Algeria is among the first countries affected since February 25, 2020. In order to benefit from its experience in the least affected countries, this study aims to describe the current situation of the epidemic and then retrospectively estimate its real burden. As a first part of the study, we described the indicators of the epidemic as; the cumulative and daily reported cases and deaths, and we computed the R0 evolution. Secondly, we used the New York City cases-fatality rate standardized by Algerian age structure, to retrospectively estimate the actual burden. We found that reported cases are in a clear diminution, but, the epidemic epicentre is moving from Blida to other cities. We noted a clear peak in daily cases-fatality from March 30, to April 17, 2020, Fig. 3, due to underestimating the actual infections of the first 25 days. Since May 8, 2020, the daily R0 is around one, Fig. 4. Moreover, we noticed 31% reduction of its mean value from 1,41 to 0,97 between the last two months. The Algerian Age-Standardized Infection Fatality Rate we found is 0,88%. Based on that, we demonstrated that only 1,5% of actual infections were detected and reported before March 30, and 20% after March 31, Fig. 5. Therefore, the actual infections burden is currently five times higher than reported. At the end, we found that at least 0,2 % of the population have been infected until May 27. Consequently, the acquired herd immunity to date is therefore not sufficient to avoid a second wave. We believe that, the under estimation of the actual burden of the epidemic is probably due to the lack of testing capacities, however, all the indicators show that the situation is currently controlled. This requires more vigilance for the next weeks during the gradual easing of the preventive measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed HAMIDOUCHE Sr.","author_inst":"Pasteur Institute of Algeria\/ Public Health school of Pasteur-CNAM of Paris"},{"author_name":"Nassira BELMESSABIH Sr.","author_inst":"Pasteur Institute of Algeria"},{"author_name":"Norman S Mang","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Christopher Joseph","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brenton C Hall","author_inst":"Parkland Health & Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Chase Prokesch","author_inst":"UT Southwestern"},{"author_name":"Anne C Walsh","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew K Chang","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael J Waxman","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Bhramar G.

Particularly, an article by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (ICCRT), published online in Nature on June 8, 2020, evaluates the efficiency of 5 NPIs. Based on mortality data up to early May, it concludes that only one of the interventions, lockdown, has been efficient in 10 out of 11 studied European countries. We show, via simulations using the ICCRT model code, that conclusions regarding the effectiveness of individual NPIs are not justified. Our analysis focuses on the 11th country, Sweden, an outlier in that no lockdown was effectuated. The new simulations show that estimated NPI efficiencies across all 11 countries change drastically unless the model is adapted to give the Swedish data special treatment. While stated otherwise in the Nature article, such adaptation has been done in the model code reproducing its results: An ungrounded country-specific parameter said to have been introduced in all 11 countries, is in the code only activated for Sweden. This parameter de facto provides a new NPI category, only present in Sweden, and with an impact comparable to that of a lockdown. While the considered NPIs have unarguably contributed to reduce virus spread, our analysis reveals that their individual efficiency cannot be reliably quantified by the ICCRT model, provided mortality data up to early May.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristian Soltesz","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Gustafsson","author_inst":"Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Toomas Timpka","author_inst":"Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Joakim Jald\u00e9n","author_inst":"KTH Royal institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Carl Jidling","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Albin Heimerson","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Sch\u00f6n","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Armin Spreco","author_inst":"Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Joakim Ekberg","author_inst":"Region \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland"},{"author_name":"\u00d6rjan Dahlstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Bagge Carlson","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Anna J\u00f6ud","author_inst":"Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Bernhardsson","author_inst":"Lund University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.159434","rel_title":"Saliva-Based Molecular Testing for SARS-CoV-2 that Bypasses RNA Extraction","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.159434","rel_abs":"Convenient, repeatable, large-scale molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 would be a key weapon to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, standard SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols are invasive and rely on numerous items that can be subject to supply chain bottlenecks, and as such are not suitable for frequent repeat testing. Specifically, personal protective equipment (PPE), nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, the associated viral transport media (VTM), and kits for RNA isolation and purification have all been in short supply at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets and aerosols transmitted through person-to-person contact, and thus saliva may be a relevant medium for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Here we describe a saliva-based testing method that bypasses the need for RNA isolation\/purification. In experiments with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into saliva, this method has a limit of detection of 500-1000 viral particles per mL, rivalling the standard NP swab method, and initial studies also show excellent performance with 100 clinical samples. This saliva-based process is operationally simple, utilizes readily available materials, and can be easily implemented by existing testing sites, thus allowing for high-throughput, rapid, and repeat testing of large populations.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diana Ranoa","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Robin Holland","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Fadi G Alnaji","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Kelsie Green","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Leyi Wang","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Christopher Brooke","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Martin Burke","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Tim Fan","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Paul J Hergenrother","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"\u00d6rjan Dahlstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"Link\u00f6ping University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Bagge Carlson","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Anna J\u00f6ud","author_inst":"Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Bernhardsson","author_inst":"Lund University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.153486","rel_title":"Potent Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Directed to Multiple Epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.153486","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic rages on with devasting consequences on human lives and the global economy1,2. The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng\/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, \"all RBD-down\" conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and\/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lihong Liu","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Wang","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Manoj S Nair","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Jian Yu","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Micah Rapp","author_inst":"Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Yang Luo","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Sahi","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Amir Figueroa","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology & Immunology Flow Cytometry Core, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Xinzheng V Guo","author_inst":"Human Immune Monitoring Core, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Cerutti","author_inst":"Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."},{"author_name":"Jude Bimela","author_inst":"Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason Gorman","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."},{"author_name":"Tongqing Zhou","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University"},{"author_name":"Peter D Kwong","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA"},{"author_name":"Joseph G Sodroski","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."},{"author_name":"Michael T Yin","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Zizhang Sheng","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Shapiro","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"David D Ho","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.158121","rel_title":"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is dynamic, disordered, and phase separates with RNA","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.158121","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is an abundant RNA binding protein that plays a variety of roles in the viral life cycle including replication, transcription, and genome packaging. Despite its critical and multifunctional nature, the molecular details that underlie how N protein mediates these functions are poorly understood. Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to the function of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. N protein contains three intrinsically disordered regions and two folded domains. All three disordered regions are highly dynamic and contain regions of transient helicity that appear to act as local binding interfaces for protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions. The two folded domains do not significantly interact with one another, such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA binding protein. As observed for other proteins with similar molecular features, we found that N protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA. Polymer models predict that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We propose a simple model in which symmetry breaking through specific binding sites promotes the formation of metastable single-RNA condensate, as opposed to large multi-RNA phase separated droplets. We speculate that RNA compaction to form dynamic single-genome condensates may underlie the early stages of genome packaging. As such, assays that measure how compounds modulate phase separation could provide a convenient tool for identifying drugs that disrupt viral packaging.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasmine Cubuk","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jhullian J Alston","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"J.

Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus we demonstrate that, in addition to human ACE2, the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the twenty-two different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat and rabbit were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the three genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle entry was inefficient in cells bearing the ACE2 receptor from bats or birds the live virus was still able to enter these cells, albeit with markedly lower efficiency. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock and wildlife.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carina Conceicao","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Nazia Thakur","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Stacey Human","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"James T Kelly","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Leanne Logan","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Dagmara Bialy","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Sushant Bhat","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Phoebe Stevenson-Leggett","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrian Zagrajek","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Philippa Hollinghurst","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Michal Varga","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Christina Tsirigoti","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"John Hammond","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Helena J Maier","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Erica Bickerton","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Holly J Shelton","author_inst":"The Pirbright institute"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Dietrich","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephen C Graham","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dalan Bailey","author_inst":"The Pirbright Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael T Yin","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Zizhang Sheng","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Yaoxing Huang","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Shapiro","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA"},{"author_name":"David D Ho","author_inst":"Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.158584","rel_title":"Unexpected free fatty acid binding pocket in the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.158584","rel_abs":"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a global crisis.

Here we investigated the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase (late February to late April) of the epidemic in Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and the community transmission of a major B.1.1 lineage defined by two amino acid substitutions in the Nucleocapsid and ORF6.

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 resulting in a global pandemic. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to induce a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human cells, leading to speculation about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit innate antiviral responses. However, innate antiviral responses are dynamic in nature and gene expression levels rapidly change within minutes to hours. In this study, we have performed a time series RNA-seq and selective immunoblot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung (Calu-3) cells to characterize early virus-host processes. SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated transcripts for type I IFNs and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) after 12 hours. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit type I IFN production and downstream antiviral signaling in human cells. Using exogenous stimuli, we discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to modulate IFN{beta} production and downstream expression of ISGs, such as IRF7 and IFIT1. Thus, data from our study indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved additional mechanisms, such as masking of viral nucleic acid sensing by host cells to mount a dampened innate antiviral response. Further studies are required to fully identify the range of immune-modulatory strategies of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSignificanceHighly pathogenic coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS have evolved proteins to shutdown antiviral responses. The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with its relatively low case-fatality rate have led to speculation about its ability to modulate antiviral responses. We show that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to block antiviral responses that are mounted by exogenous stimuli. Data from our study provide promising support for the use of recombinant type I IFN as combination therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our data also suggest that the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently modulate antiviral responses may be associated with its low case-fatality rate compared to other pathogenic CoVs that cause SARS and MERS.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arinjay Banerjee","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Daniel Richard","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Hassaan Maan","author_inst":"Vector Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Aguiar","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Nader El-Sayes","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.-M.

We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6-7 incipient phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple regions, in spite of their low frequency.

Enveloped viruses infect the host cell by cellular membrane fusion, a crucial mechanism required for virus replication. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, due to its primary interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell-surface receptor, is considered as a potential target for drug development. Based on in silico screening followed by in vitro studies, here we report that the existing FDA-approved Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of 130 nM. We provide evidence that although imatinib binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with an affinity at micromolar, i.e., 2.32 {+\/-} 0.9 M levels, imatinib does not directly inhibit the spike RBD:ACE2 interaction - suggesting a Bcr-Abl kinase-mediated fusion inhibition mechanism is responsible for the inhibitory action. We also show that imatinib inhibits other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV via fusion inhibition. Based on promising in vitro results, we propose the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ATKI), imatinib, to be a viable repurposable drug against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nirmitee Sanjay Mulgaonkar","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Haoqi Wang","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Samavath Mallawarachchi","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ruzek","author_inst":"Veterinary Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Byron Martina","author_inst":"Artemis One Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sandun Fernando","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.-M.

Throughout its spread around the world, the viral genome continued acquiring new mutations and some of them became widespread. Among them, 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations in RdRp and S, respectively, became dominant in Europe and the US, which led to debates regarding their effects on the mutability and transmissibility of the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible differences between time-dependent variation of mutation densities (MDe) of viral strains that carry these two mutations and those that do not. Our analyses at the genome and gene level led to two important findings: First, time-dependent changes in the average MDe of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed different characteristics before and after the beginning of April, when daily new case numbers started levelling off. Second, this pattern was much delayed or even non-existent for the \"mutant\" (MT) strain that harbored both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations. Although these differences were not limited to a few hotspots, it is intriguing that the MDe increase is most evident in two critical genes, S and Orf1ab, which are also the genes that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype. The nature of these unexpected relationships warrant further research.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Do\u011fa Eskier","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute (iBG-Izmir)"},{"author_name":"Asl\u0131 Suner","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6khan Karak\u016blah","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"Yavuz Oktay","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"Byron Martina","author_inst":"Artemis One Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sandun Fernando","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.-M.

Countless lives have been claimed due to the existing pandemic and the societal normalcy has been damaged permanently. As a result, it becomes crucial for academic researchers in the field of bioinformatics to combat the existing pandemic. The study involved collecting the virulent strain sequence of SARS-nCoV19 for the country USA against human host through publically available bioinformatics databases. Using in-silica analysis and reverse vaccinology, two leader proteins were identified to be potential vaccine candidates for development of a multi-epitope drug. The results of this study can provide further researchers better aspects and direction on developing vaccine and immune responses against COVID19. This work also aims at promoting the use of existing bioinformatics tools to faster streamline the pipeline of vaccine development.\n\nThe Situation of COVID19A new infection respiratory disease was first observed in the month of December 2019, in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei province, China. Studies have indicated that the reason of this disease was the emergence of a genetically-novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. This coronavirus, now named as nCoV-19, is the reason behind the spread of this fatal respiratory disease, now named as COVID-19. The initial group of infections is supposedly linked with the Huanan seafood market, most likely due to animal contact. Eventually, human-to-human interaction occurred and resulted in the transmission of the virus to humans. [13].\n\nSince then, nCoV-19 has been rapidly spreading within China and other parts of World. At the time of writing this article (mid-March 2020), COVID-19 has spread across 146 countries. A count of 164,837 cases have been confirmed of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and a total of 6470 deaths have occurred. The cumulative cases have been depicting a rising trend and the numbers are just increasing. WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a \"global health emergency\". [14].\n\nCurrent Scenario and ObjectivesCurrently, research is being conducted on a massive level to understand the immunology and genetic characteristics of the disease. However, no cure or vaccine of nCoV-19 has been developed at the time of writing this article.\n\nThough, nCoV-19 and SARS-CoV are almost genetically similar, the respiratory syndrome caused by both of them, COVID-19 and SARS respectively, are completely different.

The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and has not been externally validated. Methods: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. Findings: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. Interpretation: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population.

The test sensitivities were analyzed with a set of 34 sera obtained from 26 patients after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and varied from 76.9% (Euroimmun) to 96.2% (Abbott). The majority of assay results were confirmed in a laboratory-developed plaque reduction neutralization test and by a SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific line assay including measurement of generally low IgG avidities (Mikrogen recomLine Coronavirus IgG [Aviditaet], prototype). Moreover, 100 stored sera collected during summer 2018 (N = 50) and winter season 2018\/2019 (N = 50) were included to demonstrate test specificities. These varied from 96.0% (DiaSorin) to 100% (Epitope EDI). A subset of sera were retested with a lateral flow test (STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM\/IgG Duo) and a considerably lower sensitivity was noted. Overall, the diagnostic accuracy of the six SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/total antibody assays was good and varied from 92.9% (Euroimmun) to 98.4% (Abbott). Due to the different specificities, results of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests should be interpreted with caution.

However, detailed information on causes of death and the contribution of comorbidities to death yet is missing. Here, we report autopsy findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe COVID-19. We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage presented as the most immediate cause of death in fewer cases. Several comorbidities, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and obesity were present in the vast majority of patients. Our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to COVID-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. We therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of COVID-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sefer Elezkurtaj","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Selina Greuel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Ihlow","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Edward Michaelis","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philip Bischoff","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Catarina Alisa Kunze","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bruno Valentin Sinn","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Manuela Gerhold","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Hauptmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Barbara Ingold-Heppner","author_inst":"DRK Kliniken Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Miller","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hermann Herbst","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hubert Martin","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank L Heppner","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Horst","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Department of Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ewout Steyerberg","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA; Vanderbilt University, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Rae Woong Park","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Christian G Reich","author_inst":"Real World Solutions, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Seng Chan You","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Ryan","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter R Rijnbeek","author_inst":"Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.20131532","rel_title":"Risk of Depression in Family Caregivers: Unintended Consequence of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.20131532","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate the symptoms of poor mental health family caregivers. To investigate whether rates of depression increased in caregivers during COVID-19 and whether the unintended consequences of health protective measures, i.e., social isolation, exacerbated this risk. Another aim was to see if caregivers accessed any online\/phone psychological support during COVID. Method: Data (1349 caregivers; 7527 non-caregivers) was extracted from Understanding Society, UK population level dataset. The General Health Questionnaire cut-off scores identifying those with and without depression were our primary outcome. Results: After adjustment for confounding caregivers had a higher risk of having depression compared with non-caregivers, Odds ratio (OR) = 1.22 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.05-1.40)), p=.008 evidenced by higher levels of depression pre-COVID-19 (16.7% vs 12.1%) and during COVID-19 (21.6% vs 17.9%), respectively. Further, higher levels of loneliness increased the risk of depression almost 4-fold risk in caregivers, OR = 3.85 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.08-4.85)), p<.001), while access to therapy attenuated the risk (47%. While 60% of caregivers with depression reported not accessing any therapeutic support (e.g., online or face to face) during COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on family caregivers mental health with loneliness a significant contributor to caregivers depression. However, despite these detriments in mental health, the majority of caregivers do not access any online or phone psychiatric support. Reducing feelings of isolation therefore provides an opportunity for psychiatric services and health care professionals to support at-risk caregivers.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Gallagher","author_inst":"University of Limerick"},{"author_name":"Mark Wetherell","author_inst":"University of Northumbria"},{"author_name":"Jana Ihlow","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Edward Michaelis","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philip Bischoff","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Catarina Alisa Kunze","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bruno Valentin Sinn","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Manuela Gerhold","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Hauptmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Barbara Ingold-Heppner","author_inst":"DRK Kliniken Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Miller","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hermann Herbst","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hubert Martin","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank L Heppner","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Horst","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Department of Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ewout Steyerberg","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA;

We aimed to map early impacts of the pandemic on people with pre-existing mental health conditions and services they use, and to identify individual and service-level strategies adopted to manage these. Methods We searched for relevant material in the public domain published before 30 April 2020, including papers in scientific and professional journals, published first person accounts, media articles, and publications by governments, charities and professional associations. Search languages were English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Relevant content was retrieved and summarised via a rapid qualitative framework synthesis approach. Results We found 872 eligible sources from 29 countries. Most documented observations and experiences rather than reporting research data. We found many reports of deteriorations in symptoms, and of impacts of loneliness and social isolation and of lack of access to services and resources, but sometimes also of resilience, effective self-management and peer support. Immediate service challenges related to controlling infection, especially in inpatient and residential settings, and establishing remote working, especially in the community. We summarise reports of swiftly implemented adaptations and innovations, but also of pressing ethical challenges and concerns for the future. Conclusion Our analysis captures the range of stakeholder perspectives and experiences publicly reported in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries.

Some COVID-19 cases re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after discharge raising the public concern on their infectivity. Characterization of re-positive cases are urgently needed for designing intervention strategies. Methods Clinical data were obtained through Guangdong COVID-19 surveillance network. Neutralization antibody titre was determined using a microneutralization assay. Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated after the cell inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing. Results Among 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 were re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstance of social isolation. All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms in initial diagnosis and a younger age distribution (mean, 30.4). Re-positive cases (n=59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n=150) parallel-tested in this study. No infective viral strain could be obtained by culture and none full-length viral genomes could be sequenced for all re-positive cases. Conclusions Re-positive SARS-CoV-2 was not caused by the secondary infection and was identified in around 14% of discharged cases. A robust Nabs response and a potential virus genome degradation were detected from nearly all re-positive cases suggesting a lower transmission risk, especially through a respiratory route.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Lu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China;School of Public Health, Sou"},{"author_name":"Jinju Peng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China;School of Public Health, Sou"},{"author_name":"Qianling Xiong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China;School of Public Health, Sou"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huifang Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Tan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Runyu Yuan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lilian Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Pingping Zhou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Chumin Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lina Yi","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Louis du Plessis","author_inst":"University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jiufeng Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Alan Simpson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Mental Health Policy Research Unit Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA;

Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the changes in personal attitudes and behaviour before and after negative serological test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We conducted a survey questionnaire on 200 industry workers (69% males and 31% females) that have been previously tested negative. The survey examined participants' self-reported general attitudes towards COVID-19, sense of fear, as well as their behaviour related to protective measures before and after the testing. The participants perceived the disease as a severe health threat and acknowledged the protective measures as appropriate. They reported a high level of adherence to measures and low level of fear both before and after the testing. Although those indicators were statistically significantly reduced after the test (P < 0.004), they did not result in risk behaviour. Therefore, the serological tests are not an additional threat regarding the risk behaviour in an environment where protective measures are efficient. In contrast, they might contribute to reducing the fear in the society and working environment.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Toni Ljubic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ana Banovac","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ivan Buljan","author_inst":"Department of Research in Biomedicine and Health, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ivan Jerkovic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zeljana Basic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ivana Kruzic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Kolic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Rino Rivi Kolombatovic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ana Marusic","author_inst":"Department of Research in Biomedicine and Health, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Split; University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Chumin Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lina Yi","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Louis du Plessis","author_inst":"University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jiufeng Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Alan Simpson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Mental Health Policy Research Unit Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA; Vanderbilt University, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Rae Woong Park","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Christian G Reich","author_inst":"Real World Solutions, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Seng Chan You","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Ryan","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter R Rijnbeek","author_inst":"Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
