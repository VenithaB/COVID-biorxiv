The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many fatalities and forced scientific communities to foster their Research and Development (R & D) activities. As a result, there is an enormous growth of scholarly literature on the subject. In order to combat this novel coronavirus, the open access to scientific literature is essential. On this line, many reputed academic institutions and publication firms have made their literature on COVID-19 accessible to all. By maintaining the database of updated information on global literature on Coronavirus disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) is playing a pivotal role. The present study analyzed 89 Indian publications on SARS-CoV-2 accessible through WHO COVID-19 database. The research data was restricted for the period of 2\/3\/2020 to 12\/5\/2020. The analysis was carried out in light of the objectives of the study. The study found the considerable and constant growth of Indian publications on COVID-19 from mid-April. It is interesting to note that the prolific authors belong to either AIIMS or ICMR institutes. Majority of the COVID-19 articles were found to be collaborative publications. The study noticed that no research publications on COVID-19 have appeared from North Eastern region. Regarding the research output on COVID-19, the performance of largest states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar was found to be poor. Delhi state contributed highest publications on COVID-19. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi was the most productive institution in terms of publications. It is also important to note that the central government undertakings like AIIMS and ICMR, New Delhi and its affiliated institutions shared largest proportion of publications on COVID-19. The Indian Journal of Medical Research has emerged as the productive journal contributing highest number of the publications. The highest contribution in COVID-19 research takes the form of journal articles. In terms of research area, the majority of the publications were related to Epidemiology. The study reported covid, coronavirus, India, pandemic, sars etc. as the frequently occurred keywords in the COVID-19 publications. The highly cited publications were of evidenced based studies. It is observed that the studies pertaining to virology, diagnosis and treatment, clinical features etc. have received highest citations than general studies on epidemiology or pandemic","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"N Vasantha Raju","author_inst":"Government First Grade College, Talakadu"},{"author_name":"S.B.

App-based contact tracing has the potential to optimise the resources of overstretched public health departments. However, its efficiency is dependent on wide-spread adoption. We aimed to identify the proportion of people who had downloaded the Australian Government COVIDSafe app and examine the reasons why some did not. Method: An online national survey with representative quotas for age and gender was conducted between May 8 and May 11 2020. Participants were excluded if they were a healthcare professional or had been tested for COVID-19. Results: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 were excluded, 13 declined, and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Of survey participants, 37% had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 19% intended to, 28% refused, and 16% were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (25%) and technical concerns (24%). Other reasons included a belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app is unnecessary (16%), distrust in the Government (11%), and apathy (11%). In addition, COVIDSafe knowledge varied with confusion about its purpose and capabilities. Conclusion: For the COVIDSafe app to be accepted by the public and used correctly, public health messages need to address the concerns of its citizens, specifically in regards to privacy, data storage, and technical capabilities. Understanding the specific barriers preventing the uptake of tracing apps provides the opportunity to design targeted communication strategies aimed at strengthening public health initiatives such as download and correct use.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rae Thomas","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Zoe Michaleff","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Hannah Greenwood","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Eman Abukmail","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125666","rel_title":"SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER CONTAINED COVID-19 GROWTH RATE IN GREECE","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125666","rel_abs":"Background: The Greek authorities implemented the strong social distancing measures within the first few weeks after the first confirmed case of the virus to curtail the COVID-19 growth rate. Objectives: To estimate the effect of the two-stage strong social distancing measures, the closure of all non-essential shopping centers and businesses on March 16 and the shelter in place orders (SIPOs) on March 23 on the COVID-19 growth rate in Greece Methods: We obtained data on COVID-19 cases in Greece from February 26th through May 4th from publicly available sources. An interrupted time-series regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of the measures on the exponential growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases, controlling for the number of daily testing, and weekly fixed-effects. Results: The growth rate of the COVID-19 cases in the pre-policies implementation period was positive as expected (p=0.003). Based on the estimates of the interrupted time-series, our results indicate that the SIPO on March 23 significantly slowed the growth rate of COVID-19 in Greece (p=0.04). However, we did not find evidence on the effectiveness of standalone and partial measures such as the non-essential business closures implemented on March 16 on the COVID-19 spread reduction. Discussion: The combined social distancing measures implemented by the Greek authorities within the first few weeks after the first confirmed case of the virus reduced the COVID-19 growth rate. These findings provide evidence and highlight the effectiveness of these measures to flatten the curve and to slow the spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodoros Giannouchos","author_inst":"Pharmacotherapy Outcomes Research Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA"},{"author_name":"Aris Giannouchos","author_inst":"St. Vinzenz Hospital, Dusseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ilias Christodoulou","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Steletou","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Regional General University Hospital of Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Kyriakos Souliotis","author_inst":"Department of Social and Education Policy, University of Peloponnese, Corinth, Greece"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.07.20113142","rel_title":"Casual sex among MSM during the period of social isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic: Nationwide study in Brazil and Portugal.","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.07.20113142","rel_abs":"Background: The social isolation to which Brazilians and Portuguese are subjected has been affecting their mental and sexual health, decreasing social support and increasing sexual risk behavior and exposure to the SARSCoV-2 virus. In this study we aim to investigate the practice of casual sex and the factors that are associated with this event in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey carried out throughout Brazil and Portugal in April 2020, during the period of social isolation, with a sample of 2361 MSM. The collection took place in meeting apps and Facebook. Findings: There was a high frequency of casual sex (53%) and the use of strategies, without technical or scientific basis, to prevent infection by SARSCoV-2, such as the use of Truvada (12.7%). Among the factors that increased the chance of engaging in casual sex, we highlight: having sex simultaneously with two or more people (aOR = 2.1; 95%CI 1.4 - 3.4); Having sex with a regular and casual partner (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 0.9-2.8), and only with casual (aOR = 2.5; 95%CI 1.8 - 3.5), using Facebook (aOR = 4.6; 95%CI 3.0-7.2), and cruising, swing houses, saunas or cruising points to get partners (aOR = 5.4; 95%CI 3.2 -8.9), being HIV positive (ORa = 11.7; 95%CI 4.7-29.2), or of unknown serological status (aOR = 1.4; 95%CI 0.7-2.3). In both countries, the longer the period of social isolation, the greater the chance of engaging in casual sex. Interpretation: Despite the great differences between the two countries, in both of them we registered a significant frequency of practicing casual sex, accompanied by dubious strategies to minimize the risk of acquiring SARSCov-2. This indicates that MSM participating in the research, to some degree, continue to be exposed to risky sexual practices for HIV infection and other STIs, but also for COVID-19.

Respiratory decline in COVID-19 is mediated by a pneumonic aberrant immune cytokine storm. Low-dose radiation was used to treat pneumonia in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiation immunomodulatory effects may improve outcomes in COVID-19. Methods: We performed a single-institution phase I\/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of single-fraction, low-dose, whole-lung radiation for COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients were hospitalized, had radiographic pneumonic infiltrates, required supplemental oxygen, and were clinically deteriorating. Results: Of nine patients screened, five were treated with whole-lung radiation from April 23-28, 2020 and followed for 7 days. Median age was 90 (range 64-94); four were nursing home residents with multiple comorbidities. Within 24 hours of radiation, three patients (60%) weaned from supplemental oxygen to ambient air, four (80%) exhibited radiographic improvement, and median Glasgow coma score improved from 10 to 14. A fourth patient (80% overall recovery) weaned from oxygen at hour 96. Mean time to clinical recovery was 35 hours. There were no acute skin, pulmonary, GI, GU toxicities. Conclusions: In a pilot trial of five oxygen-dependent patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvement in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic infiltrates without acute toxicity. Low-dose whole-lung radiation is safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants further study in larger prospective trials.

Validation was performed on nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens (n=124) using newly designed dual-target rRT-PCR (altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 Reagent) for detecting of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract specimens, including bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirates. Accuracy testing demonstrated excellent assay agreement between expected and observed values. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2.7 and 23.0 gene copies\/reaction for nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, respectively. Retrospective analysis of 1,694 tests from 1,571 patients revealed increased positivity in older patients and males compared to females, and an increasing positivity rate from approximately 20% at the start of testing to 50% at the end of testing three weeks later.

Objective: To evaluate the association between ACEIs or ARBs use and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Data Sources: Systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to May 31, 2020. We also searched the preprint servers medRxiv and SSNR for additional studies. Study Selection: Observational studies and randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of ACEIs or ARBs use on clinical outcomes of adult patients with COVID-19. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Risk of bias of observational studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects models and effects expressed as Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences with their 95% confidence interval (95%CI). If available, adjusted effects were pooled. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes were COVID-19 severity, hospital discharge, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and troponin, creatinine, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and D-dimer levels. Results: 40 studies (21 cross-sectional, two case-control, and 17 cohorts) involving 50615 patients were included. ACEIs or ARBs use was not associated with all-cause mortality overall (OR 1.11, 95%CI 0.77-1.60, p=0.56), in subgroups by study design and using adjusted effects. ACEI or ARB use was independently associated with lower COVID-19 severity (aOR 0.56, 95%CI 0.37-0.87, p<0.01). No significant associations were found between ACEIs or ARBs use and hospital discharge, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and biomarkers. Conclusions and Relevance: ACEIs or ARBs use was not associated with higher all-cause mortality in COVID-19. However, ACEI or ARB use was independently associated with lower COVID-19 severity. Our results support the current international guidelines to continue the use of ACEIs and ARBs in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Diaz-Arocutipa","author_inst":"Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola"},{"author_name":"Jose Saucedo-Chinchay","author_inst":"Programa de Atencion Domiciliaria - Essalud"},{"author_name":"Adrian V.

To appropriately design policies and anticipate behavioral change, it is important to understand how different Americans' social distancing behavior shifts in relation to policy announcements according to individual characteristics, and community vulnerability. Methods: This cross-sectional study used Unacast's social distancing data from February 24th - May 10th, 2020 to study how social distancing changed before and after: 1) The World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic, 2) White House announcement of \"Opening Up America Again\" (OUAA) guidelines, and 3) the week of April 27 when several states reopened. To measure intention to social distance, we assessed the difference between weekday and weekend behavior as more individuals have more control over weekend leisure time. To investigate social distancing's sensitivity to different population characteristics, we compared social distancing time-series data across county vulnerability as measured by the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) which defines vulnerability across socioeconomic, household composition, minority status, epidemiological, and healthcare-system related factors. We also compared social distancing across population groupings by race, 2016 presidential election voting choice, and employment sectors. Results: Movement reduced significantly throughout March reaching peak reduction on April 12th (-56.1%) prior the enactment of any reopening policies. Shifts in social distancing began after major announcements but prior to specific applied policies: Following the WHO declaration, national social distancing significantly increased on weekdays and weekends (-18.6% and -41.3% decline in mobility, respectively). Social distancing significantly declined on weekdays and weekends after OUAA guidelines (i.e. before state reopening) (+1.1% and +5.3% increase in mobility, respectively) with additional significant decline after state reopening (+10.0% and +20.9% increase in mobility, respectively). Social distancing was significantly greater on weekends than weekdays throughout March, however, the trend reversed by early May with significantly less social distancing on weekends, suggesting a shift in intent to social distance during leisure time. In general, vulnerable counties social distanced less than non-vulnerable counties, and had a greater difference between weekday and weekend behavior until state reopening. This may be driven by structural barriers that vulnerable communities face, such as higher rates of employment in particular sectors. At all time periods studied, the average black individual in the US social distanced significantly more than the average white individual, and the average 2016 Clinton voter social distanced significantly more than the average 2016 Trump voter. Social distancing behavior differed across industries with three clusters of employment sectors. Conclusion: Both signaling of a policy change and implementation of a policy are important factors that seem to influence social distancing. Behaviors shifted with national announcements prior to mandates, though social distancing further declined nationwide as the first states reopened. The variation in behavioral drivers including vulnerability, race, political affiliation, and employment industry demonstrates the need for targeted policy messaging and interventions tailored to address specific barriers for improved social distancing and mitigation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vincent S Huang","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Staci Sutermaster","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Yael Caplan","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kemp","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Danielle Schmutz","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Sema K Sgaier","author_inst":"Surgo Foundation"},{"author_name":"Massimo Loda","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lars F Westblade","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cushing","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hanna Rennert","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohammad K Khan","author_inst":"Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20116624","rel_title":"Associations between COVID-19 infection, tobacco smoking and nicotine use, common respiratory conditions and inhaled corticosteroids: a prospective QResearch-Case Mix Programme data linkage study January-May 2020","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20116624","rel_abs":"Introduction Epidemiological and laboratory research seems to suggest that smoking and perhaps nicotine alone could reduce the severity of COVID-19. Likewise, there is some evidence that inhaled corticosteroids could also reduce its severity, opening the possibility that nicotine and inhaled steroids could be used as treatments. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we will link English general practice records from the QResearch database to Public Health England's database of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests, Hospital Episode Statistics, admission to intensive care units, and death from COVID-19 to identify our outcomes: hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death due to COVID. Using Cox regression, we will perform sequential adjustment for potential confounders identified by separate directed acyclic graphs to: 1. Assess the association between smoking and COVID-19 disease severity, and how that changes on adjustment for smoking-related comorbidity. 2. More closely characterise the association between smoking and severe COVID-19 disease by assessing whether the association is modified by age (as a proxy of length of smoking), gender, ethnic group, and whether people have asthma or COPD. 3. Assess for evidence of a dose-response relation between smoking intensity and disease severity, which would help create a case for causality. 4. Examine the association between former smokers who are using NRT or are vaping and disease severity. 5.

Assess whether the association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma and COVID-19 disease severity is modified by age, gender, ethnicity, and smoking status. 7. Assess whether the use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with severity of COVID-19 disease. 8. To assess whether the association between use of inhaled corticosteroids and severity of COVID-19 disease is modified by the number of other airways medications used (as a proxy for severity of condition) and whether people have asthma or COPD. Conclusions This representative population sample will, to our knowledge, present the first comprehensive examination of the association between smoking, nicotine use without smoking, respiratory disease, and severity of COVID-19. We will undertake several sensitivity analyses to examine the potential for bias in these associations.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Aveyard","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicola Lindson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Min Gao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hartmann-Boyce","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Margaret Smith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Duncan Young","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Carol Coupland","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Pui San Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ashley K Clift","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Harrison","author_inst":"Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (icnarc)"},{"author_name":"Doug W Gould","author_inst":"Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (icnarc)"},{"author_name":"Ian Pavord","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Watkinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Julia Hippisley-Cox","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20107011","rel_title":"A COVID-19 outbreak in a rheumatology department upon the early days of the pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20107011","rel_abs":"Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department, early in the pandemic. Methods: Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Results: 14\/34 HCWs (41%; 40{+\/-}14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11\/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnoea before testing, which were absent in 3\/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28{+\/-}18 days), viral shedding (31{+\/-}10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51) and work absence (29{+\/-}28 days) were prolonged. 13\/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response, with higher IgG-index in individuals over 50 years (14.5{+\/-}7.7 vs 5.0{+\/-}4.4, p=0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1\/8 hospitalisation, 8\/8 complete recovery), following a consultation\/procedure with an asymptomatic (7\/8) or mildly-symptomatic (1\/8) HCW. Conclusions: A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognised, and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasco C.

This paper proposes a critical review of the state of the art regarding studies on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and sewage sludge, the factors affecting its inactivation and the main proposed treatments, with the aim to provide useful information at operative level in order to better and safer manage wastewater and sewage sludge. Given the lack of literature on SARS-CoV-2, studies involving other HCoVs such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E have been also considered. In wastewater, the resistance of SARS-CoV has proven to be very limited, especially at temperatures above 20 {degrees}C, and the virus has been easily removed with the use of chlorine (> 0.5 mg L-1 for 30 min). For sewage sludge, based on in vitro experiments, it is suggested to increase the retention times before a possible reuse in agriculture only for precautionary purposes, since SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to occur in the sludge. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater might track the epidemic trends: although being extremely promising, an effective and wide application of this approach requires a deeper knowledge of the amounts of viruses excreted through the faeces and the actual detectability of viral RNA in sewage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Collivignarelli","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Carlo Collivignarelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marco Carnevale Miino","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Abb&agrave","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberta Pedrazzani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Bertanza","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Lu\u00eds Galaio","author_inst":"Occupational Health Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Helena Proen\u00e7a","author_inst":"Clinical Pathology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Melo Cristino","author_inst":"Clinical Pathology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Ema Sacadura-Leite","author_inst":"Occupational Health Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Nikita Khmelinskii","author_inst":"Rheumatology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte; Rheumatology Research Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Fac"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Carlos Romeu","author_inst":"Rheumatology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte, Lisbon Academic Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o Eurico Fonseca","author_inst":"Rheumatology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Norte; Rheumatology Research Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Fac"},{"author_name":"- CHULN Rheumatology Department","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20122549","rel_title":"Policy Implications of an Approximate Linear Infection Model for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20122549","rel_abs":"We propose a linear model of infection probability, and prove that this is a good approximation to a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks.

Methods: We evaluated patients treated with tocilizumab for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between 3\/13\/20 and 4\/16\/20. This was a multi-center study with data collected by chart review both retrospectively and concurrently. Parameters evaluated included age, sex, race, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), usage of steroids and vasopressors, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. In the absence of mechanical ventilation, the timing of the dose was related to the patient's date of admission only. Results: We evaluated 145 patients. The average age was 58.1 years, 64% were male, 68.3% had comorbidities, and 60% received steroid therapy. Disposition of patients was 48.3% discharged and 29.3% expired, of which 43.9% were African American. Mechanical ventilation was required in 55.9%, of which 34.5% expired. Avoidance of MV (p value = 0.002) and increased survival (p value < 0.001) was statistically associated with early dosing. Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy was effective at decreasing mortality and should be instituted early in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Russell Petrak","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nathan Skorodin","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Van Hise","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Robert Fliegelman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Pinsky","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Vishal Didwania","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Michael Anderson","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Melina Diaz","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kairav Shah","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Chundi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Hines","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Harting","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20124024","rel_title":"Studying the effect of lockdown using epidemiological modelling of COVID-19 and a quantum computational approach using the Ising spin interaction","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20124024","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection that can range from being mild to fatal. In India, the countrywide lockdown has been imposed since 24th march, 2020, and has got multiple extensions with different guidelines for each phase. Among various models of epidemiology, we use the SIR(D) model to analyze the extent to which this multi-phased lockdown has been active in `flattening the curve' and lower the threat. Analyzing the effect of lockdown on the infection may give us a better insight into the evolution of epidemic while implementing the quarantine procedures as well as improving the healthcare facilities. For accurate modelling, incorporating various parameters along with sophisticated computational facilities, are required. Parallel to SIRD modelling, we tend to compare it with the Ising model and derive a quantum circuit that incorporates the rate of infection and rate of recovery, etc as its parameters. The probabilistic plots obtained from the circuit qualitatively resemble the shape of the curve for the spread of Coronavirus. We also demonstrate how the curve flattens when the lockdown is imposed. This kind of quantum computational approach can be useful in reducing space and time complexities of a huge amount of information related to the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anshuman Padhi","author_inst":"National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Sudev Pradhan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Berhampur"},{"author_name":"Pragna Paramita Sahoo","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Berhmapur"},{"author_name":"Kalyani Suresh","author_inst":"University of Mysore, Mysuru"},{"author_name":"Bikash Kumar Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Prasanta Kumar Panigrahi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Michael Anderson","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Melina Diaz","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kairav Shah","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Chundi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Hines","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Harting","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20124149","rel_title":"Hawkes process modeling of COVID-19 with mobility leading indicators and spatial covariates","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20124149","rel_abs":"Hawkes processes are used in machine learning for event clustering and causal inference, while they also can be viewed as stochastic versions of popular compartmental models used in epidemiology.

After ruling out the effect of reporting biases, the analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) atmospheric profiles further confirms that this variability is linked to atmospheric particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 1 micron. SWC accounts for 20% of the variance in KD and its contribution is stable throughout the entire epidemiological record dating back to 1970, both at the prefecture level and for entire Japan. KD maxima in 2010-2016 always occur in full synchrony with LIDAR particle arrival in diverse locations such as Tokyo, Toyama and Tsukuba as well as for the entire of Japan. Rapid intrusion of aerosols from heights up to 6km to the surface is observed with KD admissions co-varying with their metal chemical composition.

Antipsychotics are usually used for the pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral disturbances. The selection of concomitant COVID-19 medications and antipsychotics should be evidence-based and closely monitored Objective: To systematically review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics. Evidence Review: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and TdP, the CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was searched. Based on the information collected, the authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to find the clinical outcomes of drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics Results: The main interaction between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT prolongation and TdP, and CYP interactions. Remdesivir, favipiravir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics with no risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics, although it can restore the activity of CYP3A4 and therefore its substrate metabolism may increase. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for co-administration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin (all prolong QT interval) and lopinavir \/ ritonavir (CYP interaction and risk of QT prolongation). Conclusions: We urge to development of evidence-based guidelines that can help clinicians decide the safest treatment combination and monitoring necessary for each particular patient. The selection of concomitant COVID-19 medications and antipsychotics should be evidence-based and closely monitored.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beatriz Oda Plasencia-Garcia","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Rodriguez-Menendez","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Isabel Rico-Rangel","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Rubio-Garcia","author_inst":"Psychiatry Department, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jaime Torello-Iserte","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Benedicto Crespo-Facorro","author_inst":"Head and Chair of the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, IBIS, CIBERSAM, University of Sevilla, Spain."},{"author_name":"Michael Anderson","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Melina Diaz","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kairav Shah","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Vishnu Chundi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Hines","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Harting","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20124180","rel_title":"COVID 19 Pandemic: A Real-time Forecasts & Prediction of Confirmed Cases, Active Cases using the ARIMA model &Public Health in West Bengal, India.","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20124180","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 2020. This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. As economic burden makes it increasingly difficult for our country to continue imposing control measures, it is vital for states like West Bengal to make predictions using time series forecasting for the upcoming cases , test kits , health care and estimated the requirement of Quarantine centers, isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients . Objective: This study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until August, using time series ARIMA model & Public Health in West Bengal, India. Methods: We used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the end of August month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal, India from March 1, 2020, to June 4, 2020. Discussion and Conclusion: This forecasts show a very crucial situation for West Bengal in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed case as Lockdown 5.0 & Unlock 1.0 will be implemented from 1st June 2020 in India, West Bengal will be observing a partial lift of the lockdown and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of Health care sector needs to be further improved isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be needed to increase in that scenario. Inter State & Intra State Movement restrictions are lifted. Hence, Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest more of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system, which will directly or indirectly affect the States in the time of crisis.

Although many models have been developed all around the world, transparent models that allow interacting with the assumptions will become more important as we test various strategies for lockdown, testing and social interventions and enable effective policy decisions. In this paper, we developed a suite of models to guide the development of policies under different scenarios when the lockdown opens. These had been deployed to create an interactive dashboard called COVision which includes the Agent-based Models (ABM) and classical compartmental models (CCM). Our tool allows simulation of scenarios by changing the strength of lockdown, basic reproduction number(R0), asymptomatic spread, testing rate, contact rate, recovery rate, incubation period, leakage in lockdown etc. We optimized ABM and CCMs and evaluated them on multiple error metrics. Out of these models in our suite, ABM was able to capture the data better than CCMs. Our evaluation suggests that ABM models were able to capture the dynamic nature of the epidemic for a longer duration of time while CCMs performed inefficiently. We computed R0 using CCMs which were found to be decreasing with lockdown duration, indicating the effectiveness of policies in different states of India. Models have been deployed on a dashboard hosted at http:\/\/covision.tavlab.iiitd.edu.in which allows users to simulate outcomes under different parameters and will allow the policymakers to make informed decisions and efficient monitoring of the covid19 pandemic in India.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya Nagori","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of genomics and integrative biology, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vineet Joshi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Suryatej Reddy Vyalla","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Akhil Jarodia","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chandan Gupta","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amogh Gulati","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Harsh Bandhey","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Keerat Kaur Guliani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Mehrab Singh Gill","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20123505","rel_title":"Knowledge and Awareness-based Survey of COVID-19 within the Eye Care Profession in Nepal: Misinformation is Hiding the Truth.","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20123505","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: Nepal is currently under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic with misinformation circulating on social media.

We modelled the effects of enforced inactivity on diabetes burden using published evidence. Methods: Using Health Survey for England data, we estimated the prevalence of pre-diabetes and physical activity in adults aged 70 and older. The number of new diabetes cases directly attributed to lockdown were calculated using population attributable risk. Unit cost estimates of the additional burden on primary care and the cost of complications to secondary care were taken from the literature. Results: From 9 million older (aged 70yrs and above) people living in England, 2.1 million could be defined as pre-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin > 42 < 48 mmol\/mol). The estimated population attributable fraction (0.281) (assuming relative risk of diabetes from inactivity, 3.3; 40% physically active pre-lockdown) would give rise to 392,948 new cases of diabetes which we argue are directly attributed to a prolonged period of lockdown. We estimate that the cost of screening and testing these patients in primary care (GBP 35m), their subsequent treatment and management (GBP 229m), and complications (GBP 909m) would equate to an additional GBP 1.17bn to the health care system. Conclusions: Inactivity related to lockdown in previously active older adults may contribute up to GBP 1.17b in additional healthcare costs through a potential increase in diabetes. Clear advice about the importance of physical activity may reduce this potential economic burden during global pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Kipps","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mark Hamer","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paula Lorgelly","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Akhil Jarodia","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Chandan Gupta","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amogh Gulati","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Harsh Bandhey","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Keerat Kaur Guliani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Mehrab Singh Gill","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kamo Sidwha","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Brian Yu","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Paul Brune","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Anjum Owaisi","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"David Beezhold","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kent","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Dana Vais","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Alice Han","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Neethi Gowda","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Nishi Sahgal","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jan Silverman","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stake","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Jenie Nepomuceno","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"},{"author_name":"Renuka Heddurshetti","author_inst":"Metro Infectious Disease Consultants"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120832","rel_title":"A how-to-guide to building a robust SARS-CoV-2 testing program at a university-based health system","rel_date":"2020-06-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120832","rel_abs":"When South Florida became a hotspot for COVID-19 disease in March 2020, we faced an urgent need to develop test capability to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This process was extremely complex, due to the limited availability of needed reagents, but outreach to our research scientists and to multiple diagnostic laboratory companies and government officials enabled us to implement both FDA authorized and laboratory developed testing (LDT)-based testing protocols. We analyzed our workforce needs and created teams of appropriately skilled and certified workers, to safely process patient samples and conduct SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing.

The reported results were controversial, so the objective of the present study is to assess the relationship between different blood groups and the onset and mortality of COVID-19 infection using meta-analysis method. Methods: We searched the databases using appropriate MeSH terms. We screened articles on the basis of titles, abstracts, and full texts and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Quality assessment was done with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist. The estimated frequency of COVID-19 infection and death in terms of ABO blood group and the overall estimate of the odd ratio between blood group with COVID-19 infection and death was done with 95% confidence interval. Results: The pooled frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among COVID-19 infected individuals was estimated as 36.22%, 24.99%, 29.67%, and 9.29% respectively. The frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among the dead cases due to COVID-19 infection was estimated as 40%, 23%, 29%, and 8% respectively. The odd ratio of COVID-19 infection for blood group A versus the other blood groups was estimated 1.16 (CI 95%: 1.02-1.33). The corresponding figures for blood groups O and AB versus other blood groups were estimated as 0.73 (CI 95%: 0.60-0.88) and 1.25(CI 95%: 0.84-1.86) respectively. Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that individuals with blood group A are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection while those with blood group O are at lower risk. Although the odds ratio of death for AB blood group was non-significant, it was considerable.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fateme Pourali","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Afshari","author_inst":"Zabol University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Javad Javidnia","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Moosazadeh","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lazara Pagan","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lauren Gjolaj","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jessica MacIntyre","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Triana","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Barbara Vance","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"David Andrews","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yao-Shan Fan","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Octavio Martinez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica Garcia-Buitrago","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Cray","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Tekin","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, John P.

Methods Saliva samples from 103 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (15 asymptomatic and 88 symptomatic) were collected on the day of hospital admission. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva was detected using a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) laboratory-developed test (LDT), a cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, three direct RT-qPCR kits, and reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Viral antigen was detected by a rapid antigen immunochromatographic assay. Results Of the 103 samples, viral RNA was detected in 50.5-81.6% of the specimens by molecular diagnostic tests and an antigen was detected in 11.7% of the specimens by the rapid antigen test. Viral RNA was detected at a significantly higher percentage (65.6-93.4%) in specimens collected within 9 d of symptom onset compared to that of specimens collected after at least 10 d of symptom onset (22.2-66.7%) and that of asymptomatic patients (40.0-66.7%). Viral RNA was more frequently detected in saliva from males than females. Conclusions Self-collected saliva is an alternative specimen diagnosing COVID-19. LDT RT-qPCR, cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, direct RT-qPCR except for one commercial kit, and RT-LAMP showed sufficient sensitivity in clinical use to be selectively used according to clinical settings and facilities. The rapid antigen test alone is not recommended for initial COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low sensitivity.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayu Ikeda","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuo Imai","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Tabata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tsukasa Mizuno","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nami Murahara","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Midori Horiuchi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kento Kato","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yoshitaka Imoto","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maki Iwata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Mimura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Kato","author_inst":"International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital"},{"author_name":"Octavio Martinez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Monica Garcia-Buitrago","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolyn Cray","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Tekin","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, John P.

Evidence recommends that vitamin D might be an important supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in cytokine response regulation against COVID-19. Hence, we carried out a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis along with an ecological investigation in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin D in the COVID-19. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar (intitle) as well as preprint database of medRxiv, bioRxiv, Research Square, preprints.org, search engine of ScienceDirect and a rapid search through famous journals up to August 4, 2020. Studies focused on the role of vitamin D in confirmed COVID-19 patients were entered into the systematic review. Along with our main aim, to find the second objective correlation of global vitamin D status and COVID-19 recovery and mortality we carried out a literature search in PubMed database to identify the national or regional studies reported the vitamin D status globally. CMA v. 2.2.064 and SPSS v.16 were used for data analysis. Results: Eleven studies containing 360,972 participants entered into the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis indicated that 37.7% of COVID-19 patients were suffering from vitamin D deficiency (95% CI, 26.7%-50.1%) and in 32.2% of patients, levels of vitamin D were insufficient (95% CI, 13.8%-58.4%). Also, a significant increased risk of COVID-19 was found in individuals with low levels of vitamin D (OR: 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75). In regard to our ecological investigation on 51 countries including 408,748 participants, analyses indicated no correlation between vitamin D levels and recovery rate (r= 0.041) as well as mortality rate (r=-0.073) globally. However, given latitude, a small reverse correlation between mortality rate and vitamin D status was observed throughout the globe (r= -0.177). In Asia, a medium direct correlation was observed for recovery rate (r= 0.317) and a significant reveres correlation for mortality rate (r= -0.700) with vitamin D status in such patients. In Europe, there were no correlations for both recovery (r= 0.040) and mortality rate (r= -0.035). In Middle East, the recovery rate (r= 0.267) and mortality rate (r= -0.217) showed a medium correlation. In North and Sought America, surprisingly, both recovery and mortality rate demonstrated a direct correlation respectively (r= 1.000, r=0.500). In Oceania, unexpectedly, recovery (r= -1.000) and mortality (r= -1.000) rates were in considerable reverse correlation with vitamin D levels. Conclusion: In this systematic review and meta-analysis with an ecological approach, we found a high percentage of COVID-19 patients who suffer from vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency as well as a significant increased risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with low levels of vitamin D. Our ecological investigation resulted in substantial direct and reverse correlations between recovery and mortality rates of COVID-19 patients with vitamin D status in different countries. Considering latitudes, a small reverse correlation between vitamin D status and mortality rate was found globally. It seems that populations with lower levels of vitamin D might be more susceptible to the novel coronavirus infection. Nevertheless, due to multiple limitations, if this study does not allow to quantify a value of the Vitamin D with full confidence, it allows at least to know what the Vitamin D might be and that it would be prudent to invest in this direction through comprehensive large randomized clinical trials.

To date, 89442 confirmed cases have been diagnosed in Lombardy, and mortality in several municipalities has already surpassed that of the past decade. Currently, the true extent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown as several affected subjects may have been asymptomatic or have presented mild disease, thus not resulting in the identified COVID-19 cases. Methods This cross-sectional study aims to define the spread of infection within the population by determining the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid immunochromatographic testing and subsequent confirmation by serology on venous blood by liquid phase immunochemical testing, also allowing to compare the two methods. Testing will be performed on adults and minors residing, domiciled or working in several municipalities of the Lombardy Region, involved in the initial stages of the epidemic. The study will include rapid finger-prick testing and venous sampling for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS). Concurrent notification of test results will occur via the regional healthcare information system (SISS). Discussion This study was developed with the desire to understand the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the epidemiological transmission characteristics of this virus. Understanding the spread and severity of the disease could help in the implementation of effective infection surveillance containment and countermeasures facilitating the identification of cases that have been exposed to the virus and the traceability of contacts.

In this study, a random forest of 9,250 regression trees was applied to 6,941 observations of 13 statistically significant predictor variables targeting SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates per 100,000 across 88 days in 157 countries. One key finding is an algorithm that can predict the incidence rate per day of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic cycle with a pseudo-R2 accuracy of 98.5% and explain 97.4% of the variances. Another key finding is the relative importance of 13 demographic, economic, environmental, and public health modulators to the SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate. Four factors proposed in earlier research as potential modulators have no statistically significant relationship with incidence rates (2)(3). These findings give leaders new capabilities for improved capacity planning and targeting stay-at-home interventions and prioritizing programming by knowing the atypical social determinants that are the root causes of SARS-CoV-2 incidence variance. This work also proves that machine learning can accurately and quickly explain disease dynamics for zoonoses with pandemic potential.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Luellen","author_inst":"Bioinformatix"},{"author_name":"Dario Bernacchia","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Federico Conti","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Rossana Rondanin","author_inst":"Medispa s.r.l."},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie-PSL Research University, CNRS, Sorbonne Universite', UMR3664, F-75005, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Alireza Motamedzadeh","author_inst":"Kashan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ehsan Dadgostar","author_inst":"Halal Research Center of IRI"},{"author_name":"Marzieh Aalinezhad","author_inst":"Isfahan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Morteza Behnamfar","author_inst":"North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Anahita Asadi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bahman Zarandi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nazanin Razzaghi","author_inst":"Golestan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vahid Yaghoubi Naei","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Amirhossein Hessami","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Azizi","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Reza Mohseni","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Danial Shamshirian","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bilbao","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Silvia Prieto","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maritza Polania","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maritza Suarez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa Lujardo","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gloria Campos","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michele Morris","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bhavarth Shukla","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alberto Caban-Martinez","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Erin Kobetz","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dipen Parekh","author_inst":"Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Merce Jorda","author_inst":"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
