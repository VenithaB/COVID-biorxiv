In this crucial day with 1 436 198 confirmed infected cases in the world and 85 521 deaths, the Global Level of the Covid-19 pandemic was evaluated at very high according to the World Health Organization (WHO) situation report. For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness (fever and at least one symptom of respiratory disease); however, for more than 3.4% of people, it can be fatal. Older people and those with preexisting medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, or diabetes) are at risk of severe disease and mortality. The incubation period of the virus is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days, but longer incubation had been reported. Furthermore, data published by world authorities show that statistics are different for different geographical regions and depend on many social and environmental factors. The sad reality of the COVID-19 is that there are currently no medications or vaccines proven to be effective for the treatment or prevention of the disease. The pandemic spread is consequenctly followed by a worldwide panic. Facing this dramatic uncertain situation, implementing a country-wide strategy for social distancing and a general logistic policy for critical and life-saving supplies is an urgent for government and sanitary authorities. Several mathematical models have been proposed to predict epidemic spread. However, models should be adapted to specific situations in countries where geographic, societal, economic, and political strategies are different. Here, we propose the application of the well-known SIR model to the case study of Tunisia for which data are collected from three databases in order to have rapidly predict the situation. Such results can be useful in the future to design a more reliable model to help in monitoring infection control.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abir Lassoued","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Afef Ben Saad","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hela Lassoued","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Raouf Ketata","author_inst":"University of Carthage, National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Olfa Boubaker","author_inst":"University of Carthage; National Institue of Applied Sciences and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076885","rel_title":"Facing the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC: a stochastic agent-based model of various intervention strategies","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076885","rel_abs":"Global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis worldwide. Despite uncertainties about COVID-19, model-based forecasting of competing mitigation measures on its course is urgently needed to inform mitigation policy. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City and evaluated the potential impact of quarantine duration (from 4 to 16 weeks), quarantine lifting type (1-step lifting for all individuals versus a 2-step lifting according to age), post-quarantine screening, and use of a hypothetical effective treatment against COVID-19 on the disease's cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The source code of the model has been deposited in a public source code repository. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is efficient to contain the viral spread, it is unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted. We projected that lifting quarantine in a single step for the full population would be unlikely to substantially lower the cumulative mortality, regardless of quarantine duration. By contrast, a two-step quarantine lifting according to age was associated with a substantially lower cumulative mortality and incidence, up to 71% and 23%, respectively, as well as lower ICU-bed occupancy. Although post-quarantine screening was associated with diminished epidemic rebound, this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overcrowded. It may even become deleterious after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age if the herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to become established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. An effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably reduce the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Hoertel","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Martin Blachier","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Carlos Blanco","author_inst":"National Institute on Drug Abuse"},{"author_name":"Mark Olfson","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Marc Massetti","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Frederic Limosin","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Henri Leleu","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076935","rel_title":"Association of Digestive Symptoms and Hospitalization in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076935","rel_abs":"Background: High rates of concurrent gastrointestinal manifestations have been noted in patients with COVID- 19, however the association between these digestive manifestations and need for hospitalization has not been established. Methods: Following expedited approval from our Institutional Review Board, we analyzed retrospectively collected data from consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 based on a positive polymerase chain reaction testing at our institution from March 03, 2020 to April 7, 2020. Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and patient-reported symptom data were collected at presentation in the emergency room. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between hospitalization and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: During this study period, we identified 207 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. 34.5% noted concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms; of which 90% of gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. In a multivariate regression model controlled for demographics and disease severity, an increased risk for hospitalization was noted in patients with any gastrointestinal symptom (adjusted OR 4.84 95% CI: 1.68-13.94]. Diarrhea was associated with a seven-fold higher likelihood for hospitalization (adjusted OR=7.58, 95% CI: 2.49-20.02, P <0.001) and nausea or vomiting had a four times higher odds (adjusted OR 4.39, 95% CI: 1.61-11.4, P = 0.005). Conclusion: We demonstrate that a significant portion of COVID19 patients have concurrent mild gastrointestinal symptoms and that the presence of these digestive symptoms is associated with a need for hospitalization. With the current focus on streamlining triaging efforts, first responders and frontline providers should consider assessing for digestive symptoms in their initial clinical evaluation and decision-making.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George Cholankeril","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander Podboy","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vickie Aivaliotas","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Edward A Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Branden Tarlow","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sean Spencer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Donghee Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ann Hsing","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Aijaz Ahmed","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076943","rel_title":"Variation in COVID-19 Outbreaks at U.S. State and County Levels","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076943","rel_abs":"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to the health and economic prosperity of the world's population. Yet, some countries or regions within a country appear to be affected in different ways. Objectives. This research aims to understand whether the outbreak varies significantly between U.S. states and counties. Methods. A statistical model is estimated using publicly available outbreak data in the U.S., and regional differences are statistically analyzed. Results. There is significant variance in outbreak data between U.S. states and counties. At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days). But there is a low degree of reliability between state-wide and county-specific data reported (ICC = 0.169, p < 0.001), with a bias of 0.070 (standard deviation 0.062) as shown with a Bland-Altman plot. Conclusions. The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from the smallest population subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented, and critical resources provided effectively. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for these regional differences.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wolfgang Messner","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Payson","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Vickie Aivaliotas","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Edward A Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Branden Tarlow","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sean Spencer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Donghee Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ann Hsing","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Aijaz Ahmed","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.066761","rel_title":"Heparin inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2: structural dependence of the interaction of the surface protein (spike) S1 receptor binding domain with heparin.","rel_date":"2020-04-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.066761","rel_abs":"The dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the cell surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate (HS) for the regulation of homeostasis is exploited by many microbial pathogens as a means of adherence and invasion.

Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here, we show that the addition of heparin to Vero cells between 6.25 - 200 g.ml-1, which spans the concentration of heparin in therapeutic use, and inhibits invasion by SARS-CoV-2 at between 44 and 80%. We also demonstrate that heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain and induces a conformational change, illustrated by surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. The structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulphation, and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N-sulphation. A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. These findings have implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Mycroft-West","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Isabel Pagani","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

We present a multiscale model and simulation of an epithelial tissue infected by a virus, a simplified cellular immune response and viral and immune-induced tissue damage. The model exhibits basic patterns of infection dynamics: widespread infection, slowed infection, recurrence, containment and clearance. Inhibition of viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment promote containment of infection. Fast viral internalization and slower immune response lead to uncontrolled spread of infection. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects at high doses and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during the course of infection, we studied the effects on infection progression of both treatment potency (which combines drug effectiveness and dosage) and time-of-first treatment after infection. Simulation of a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA shows that even a low potency therapy greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. However, even a high potency therapy rapidly loses effectiveness when given later near the time of peak viral load in the untreated case. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control of the virus (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells in the simulated tissue subregion (treatment failure). This switch between a regime of consistent treatment success and failure occurs as the time of treatment increases. However, stochastic variations in viral spread mean that high potency treatments at late times are occasionally effective. The model is open-source and modular, allowing rapid development and extension of its components by groups working in parallel.\n\nAuthor summaryThis study presents an open source multiscale model of viral immune interactions in epithelial tissues. The model is used to investigate how potential treatments influence the simulation outcome. Simulation results suggest that drugs that interfere with virus replication (e.g., remdesivir) yield substantially improved infection outcomes when administered prophylactically even at very low doses than when used at high doses as treatment for an infection that has already begun.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"T.J.

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose multiple genomic and sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts hijack the host cells machinery, located across distinct cytotopic locations. Subcellular localization of its viral RNA could play important roles in viral replication and host antiviral immune response. Here we perform computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses and perform systematic sub-sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models, we predict that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and all sgRNAs are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus. The 5 and 3 viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct localization signals. We discuss the mitochondrial localization signal in relation to the formation of double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle. Our computational analysis serves as a hypothesis generation tool to suggest models for SARS-CoV-2 biology and inform experimental efforts to combat the virus.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin E Wu","author_inst":"Stanford  University"},{"author_name":"James Zou","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Howard Y Chang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Samuel Heaps","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Kira Breithaupt","author_inst":"Cognitive Science Program, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN"},{"author_name":"Lutz Brusch","author_inst":"Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing (ZIH), Technische Universitat Dresden"},{"author_name":"James M.

Methods: A systematic review identified all studies published between 1\/12\/19 and 19\/4\/20 that used primary data and inferential statistics to assess associations between the outcome of interest - disease severity - and historical or clinical variables. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the WHO Database of Publications on Coronavirus Disease were searched. Data were independently extracted and cross-checked independently by two reviewers using PRISMA guidelines, after which they were descriptively analysed. Quality and risk of bias in available evidence were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. This review was registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42020178098. Results: Of the 6202 relevant articles found, 63 were eligible for inclusion; these studies analysed data from 17648 COVID-19 patients. The majority (n=57, 90.5%) were from China and nearly all (n=51, 90.5%) focussed on admitted adult patients. Patients had a median age of 52.5 years and 52.8% were male. The predictors most frequently associated with COVID-19 disease severity were age, absolute lymphocyte count, hypertension, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and history of any pre-existing medical condition. Conclusion: This study identified multiple variables likely to be predictive of severe COVID-19 illness. Due to the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is currently no severity prediction tool designed to, or validated for, COVID-19 illness severity. Findings may inform such a tool that can offer guidance on clinical treatment and disposition, and ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality due to the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer L Pigoga","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Friedman","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Morgan Broccoli","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hirner","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antoinette Vanessa Naidoo","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Swasthi Singh","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kalin Werner","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Lee A Wallis","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Richard K.

Interpretation: Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and show that wastewater analysis is a sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Walter Randazzo","author_inst":"Department of Preservation and Food Safety Technologies, IATA-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain and Department of Microbiology and Ecology, Universitat de Valencia, 46"},{"author_name":"Enric Cuevas-Ferrando","author_inst":"Department of Preservation and Food Safety Technologies, ,IATA-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Sanjuan","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology, I2SysBio, Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Domingo-Calap","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology, I2SysBio, Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain and Department of Genetics, Universitat de Valencia, 469"},{"author_name":"Gloria Sanchez","author_inst":"Department of Preservation and Food Safety Technologies, IATA-CSIC, 46980 Paterna, Spain"},{"author_name":"Swasthi Singh","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kalin Werner","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Lee A Wallis","author_inst":"Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Richard K.

COVID-19 deaths, in contrast, are being reported as raw counts. In this report, we compare COVID-19 death counts to seasonal influenza death counts in New York City during the interval from February 1 - April 18, 2020. Using this approach, COVID-19 appears to have caused 21.4 times the number of deaths as seasonal influenza during the same period. We also assessed excess mortality in order to verify this finding. New York City has had approximately 13,032 excess all-cause mortality deaths during this time period. We assume that most of these deaths are COVID-19 related. We therefore calculated the ratio of excess deaths (i.e. assumed COVID-19 deaths) to seasonal influenza deaths during the same time interval and found a similar ratio of 21.1 COVID-19 to seasonal influenza deaths. Our findings are consistent with conditions on the ground today. Comparing COVID-19 deaths with CDC estimates of yearly influenza-related deaths would suggest that, this year, seasonal influenza has killed approximately the same number of Americans as COVID-19 has.

Also, mass group testing is not used regardless to existing shortage of tests. I propose new strategy for early detection of superspreaders with reasonable number of RT-PCR tests, which can dramatically mitigate development COVID-19 pandemic and even turn it endemic. Methods I used stochastic social-epidemiological SEIAR model, where S-suspected, E-exposed, I-infectious, A-admitted (confirmed COVID-19 positive, who are admitted to hospital or completely isolated), R-recovered. The model was applied to real COVID-19 dynamics in London, Moscow and New York City. Findings Viral loading data measured by RT-PCR were fitted by broad log-normal distribution, which governed high importance of superspreaders. The proposed full scale model of a metropolis shows that top 10% spreaders (100+ higher viral loading than median infector) transmit 45% of new cases. Rapid isolation of superspreaders leads to 4-8 fold mitigation of pandemic depending on applied quarantine strength and amount of currently infected people. High viral loading allows efficient group matrix pool testing of population focused on detection of the superspreaders requiring remarkably small amount of tests. Interpretation The model and new testing strategy may prevent thousand or millions COVID-19 deaths requiring just about 5000 daily RT-PCR test for big 12 million city such as Moscow. Though applied to COVID-19 pandemic the results are universal and can be used for other infectious heterogenous epidemics.

With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 M). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 M) due to their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea J Pruijssers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amelia S George","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Sch\u00e4fer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kenneth H Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Boyd L Yount","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Maria L Agostini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura J Stevens","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James D Chappell","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao Lu","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tia M Hughes","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kendra L Gully","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ariane J Brown","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel L Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jason K Perry","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Venice Du Pont","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jared Pitts","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Bin Ma","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Darius Babusis","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.063180","rel_title":"Structure of replicating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.063180","rel_abs":"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes.

The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Time-resolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN). Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of Remdesivir. We found that Remdesivirs 1-cyano group of possesses the dual role of inhibiting nucleotide addition and proofreading. The presence of its polar 1-cyano group at an upstream site in RdRp causes instability and hampers RdRp translocation. This leads to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension, which may also subsequently reduce the likelihood for Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on the 3-terminal nucleotide. In addition, our simulations suggest that Remdesivirs 1-cyano group can also disrupt the cleavage active site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduced cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible molecular mechanisms on how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication and may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dong Zhang","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Congmin Yuan","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Wang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yongfang Li","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xilin Jia","author_inst":"Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xin Gao","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peter Cheung","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Huang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Portmann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Tran Thi Nhu Thao","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.062471","rel_title":"Emergence of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 with signature structural changes","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.062471","rel_abs":"This study explores the divergence pattern of SARS-CoV-2 using whole genome sequences of the isolates from various COVID-19 affected countries.

Sequence analyses of ORF1ab unravelled emergence of mutations especially in the viral RdRp and helicase at specific positions, both of which are important in mediating viral RNA replication. Since proteins are dynamic in nature and their functions are governed by the molecular motions, we performed normal mode analyses of the SARS-CoV2 wild type and mutant RdRp and helicases to understand the effect of mutations on their structure, conformation, dynamics and thus function. Structural analyses revealed that mutation of RdRp (at position 4715 in the context of the polyprotein\/ at position 323 of RdRp) leads to rigidification of structure and that mutation in the helicase (at position 5828 of polyprotein\/ position 504) leads to destabilization increasing the flexibility of the protein structure. Such structural modifications and protein dynamics alterations might alter unwinding of complex RNA stem loop structures, the affinity\/ avidity of polymerase RNA interactions and in turn the viral RNA replication. The mutation analyses of proteins of the SARS-CoV2 RNA replication complex would help targeting RdRp better for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feroza Begum","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"DEBICA MUKHERJEE","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"SANDEEPAN DAS","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"DLUYA THAGRIKI","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"PREM PRAKASH TRIPATHI","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"ARUP KUMAR BANERJEE","author_inst":"North Bengal Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"UPASANA RAY","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peter Cheung","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Huang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Portmann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Tran Thi Nhu Thao","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.062422","rel_title":"Quality control of low-frequency variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.062422","rel_abs":"During the current outbreak of COVID-19, research labs around the globe submit sequences of the local SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the GISAID database to provide a comprehensive analysis of the variability and spread of the virus during the outbreak.

While it is not completely clear whether these variants are erroneous or not, these variants show lower transition\/transversion ratio. These singleton variants may influence the estimations of the viral mutation rate and tree topology. We suggest that genomes with multiple singletons even marked as high-covered should be considered with caution.

Immunosuppressive disease, chronic cardiorespiratory\/renal disease and age were key determinants of ICU mortality in a proportional hazards mixed effects model. However variation in site-stratified random effects were comparable in magnitude suggesting substantial between-centre variability in mortality.

The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard.

Eosinopenia may predict a poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, to date, there is no detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Research question: The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Study Design and Methods: This was a multi-center retrospective study conducted in three tertiary hospitals. A total of 59 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed from January 23, 2020 to March 10, 2020. We described clincial characteristics of patients with COIVD-19 and eosinopenia phenotype. Results: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) compared with mild or moderate patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lower counts of lymphocyte and eosnophils were observed in patients with severe type. Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non-eosinopenia patients. High proportion of comorbidities was observed in eosinopenia patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells\/l ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells\/l, p<0.001). The use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005). Compared with parameters in non-eosinopenia patients, eosinopenia patients were more inclined to have less lymphocyte counts (OR value 6.566, 95%CI[1.101-39.173], p=0.039). Interpretation Eosinopenia are very common in COVID-19 patient, particularly in severe patients. Common symptoms included fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue are frequent in eosinopenia patients. Eosinopenia may represent a novel phenotype in COVID-19, which needs further investigation.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yusheng Cheng","author_inst":"Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhou","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Wuhu"},{"author_name":"Mengde Zhu","author_inst":"First People Hospital of Hefei"},{"author_name":"Lei Zha","author_inst":"Infection and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Lu","author_inst":"Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhen Ding","author_inst":"First People Hospital of Hefei"},{"author_name":"Jianghua Yang","author_inst":"Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gang Yang","author_inst":"Second People Hospital of Wuhu"},{"author_name":"Peter Cheung","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Huang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manon Wider","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Portmann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Tran Thi Nhu Thao","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Rune Hartmann","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Vincent Gardeux","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Alpern","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Bart Deplancke","author_inst":"Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunology, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Ronald Dijkman","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Eisuke Murakami","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Joy Y Feng","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"John P Bilello","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Danielle P Porter","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tomas Cihlar","author_inst":"Gilead Sciences, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Timothy P Sheahan","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"}]}
