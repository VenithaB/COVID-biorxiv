In order to minimize cardiac tissue injury, primary per-cutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) as treatment of choice should be performed as soon as possible. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an ongoing major global concern affects the other parts of health care system. Applying preventive strategies during this outbreak is necessary. However, critical times in STEMI management and outcomes may be influenced by infection control protocols implementation. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences in time intervals related to STEMI care and 15-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during this outbreak compared with the same period in last year and to determine whether the STEMI protocol should be changed to thrombolytic therapy during COVID-19 outbreak or not. Methods and results: The patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI in Tehran Heart Center were included. Chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging and real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) were only performed for COVID-19 suspected patients. Seventy-seven patients from 29th February to 29th March 2020 were compared with 62 patients from 1st to 30th March 2019. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by rRT-PCR in 5 cases. CT imaging in 4 out of 5 patients was in favor of COVID-19. The median of door-to-device time was reduced 13 minutes during this outbreak (p :0.007). In-hospital mortality before and during outbreak was 3.22% and 5.19%, respectively (p: 0.57). Confirmed infection with COVID-19 was only reported in one of expired cases. The difference in 15-day MACE between two time periods was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Given that 15-day outcome in acute STEMI patients is not affected by COVID-19 outbreak, we did not find it reasonable to change our protocol. However, further studies are needed to determine a standard protocol for emergency management","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mojtaba Salarifar","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mojgan Ghavami","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hamidreza Poorhosseini","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farzad Masoudkabir","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yaser Jenab","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Amirzadegan","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Alidoosti","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hassan Aghajani","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Bozorgi","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kaveh Hosseini","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Masoumeh Lotfi-Tokaldany","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyedeh Hamideh Mortazavi","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Afsaneh Aein","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tahere Ahmadian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saeed Sadeghian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088492","rel_title":"Simulations of the spread of COVID-19 and control policies in Tunisia","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088492","rel_abs":"We develop and analyze in this work an epidemiological model for COVID-19 using Tunisian data.

As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care. Methods We performed a systematic review to gather data on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach we provide distributions for general hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community. Results We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46\/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies - four each within and outside China - with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR: 10-19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR: 3-9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5-13) days for China and 7 (4-11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eleanor M Rees","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily S Nightingale","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yalda Jafari","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naomi Waterlow","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Samuel Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Thibaut Jombert","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon R Procter","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gwenan M Knight","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masoumeh Lotfi-Tokaldany","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyedeh Hamideh Mortazavi","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Afsaneh Aein","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tahere Ahmadian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saeed Sadeghian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20084277","rel_title":"Vitamin D status, body mass index, ethnicity and COVID-19: Initial analysis of the first-reported UK Biobank COVID-19 positive cases (n 580) compared with negative controls (n 723)","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084277","rel_abs":"In this short report we present a preliminary assessment of the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status (25(OH)D), body mass index (BMI), ethnicity and other lifestyle factors in the first-reported UK Biobank COVID-19 positive cases (n 580) compared with negative controls (n 723).

We introduce Multi-lattice small world (MLSW) network as a model of a city where each ward is represented by a 2D lattice and each vertex in the latex represents an agent endowed with SEIR dynamics. Through simulation studies on MLSW we examine a variety of candidate suppression policies and find that restricting lockdowns to infected wards can indeed out-perform global Lockdowns in both reducing the attack rate and also shortening the duration of the epidemic.

We combined individual clinical risk predictions with epidemic modelling to examine simulations of risk based differential isolation and exit policies. Methods: We extended a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to account for personalised predictions of severity, defined by the risk of an individual needing intensive care if infected, and simulated differential isolation policies using COVID-19 data and estimates in France as of early May 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses. The framework may be used with other epidemic models, with other risk predictions, and for other epidemic outbreaks. Findings: Simulations indicated that, assuming everything else the same, an exit policy considering clinical risk predictions starting on May 11, as planned by the French government, could enable to immediately relax restrictions for an extra 10% (6 700 000 people) or more of the lowest-risk population, and consequently relax the restrictions on the remaining population significantly faster -- while abiding to the current ICU capacity. Similar exit policies without risk predictions would exceed the ICU capacity by a multiple. Sensitivity analyses showed that when the assumed percentage of severe patients among the population decreased, or the prediction model discrimination improved, or the ICU capacity increased, policies based on risk models had a greater impact on the results of epidemic simulations. At the same time, sensitivity analyses also showed that differential isolation policies require the higher risk individuals to comply with recommended restrictions. In general, our simulations demonstrated that risk prediction models could improve policy effectiveness, keeping everything else constant. Interpretation: Clinical risk prediction models can inform new personalised isolation and exit policies, which may lead to both safer and faster outcomes than what can be achieved without such prediction models.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodoros Evgeniou","author_inst":"INSEAD"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Fekom","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, ENS Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre Borelli"},{"author_name":"Anton Ovchinnikov","author_inst":"Smith School of Business, Queen's University"},{"author_name":"Raphael Porcher","author_inst":"Universite de Paris CRESS, INSERM, INRA"},{"author_name":"Camille Pouchol","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vayatis","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, ENS Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre Borelli"},{"author_name":"Susan Alexandra Lanham-New","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Cyrus Cooper","author_inst":"University of Southampton\/University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David J Blackbourn","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Gwenan M Knight","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masoumeh Lotfi-Tokaldany","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyedeh Hamideh Mortazavi","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Afsaneh Aein","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tahere Ahmadian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saeed Sadeghian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20084376","rel_title":"A novel deterministic forecast model for COVID-19 epidemic based on a single ordinary integro-differential equation","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084376","rel_abs":"In this paper we present a new approach to deterministic modelling of COVID-19 epidemic. Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable which satisfies an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, time-dependent variable R(t). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable R(t) can be interpreted as a generalized effective reproduction number. The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability since the model is formulated in terms of the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other non-dynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the sample effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. Extrapolated values of R(t) can be used in the model to make reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 20 countries and the ongoing results are available on a web-based platform [1].

The proposed SIR model was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the official press statements to closely reflect the observed epidemic trend in Malaysia. The proposed model is aimed to provide an accurate predictive information for decision makers in assessing the public health and social measures related to COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: The SIR model was fitted to the data by minimizing a weighted loss function; the sum of the residual sum of squares (RSS) of infected, removed and total cases. Optimized beta ({beta}), gamma ({gamma}) parameter values and the starting value of susceptible individuals (N) were obtained. Results: The SIR model post-MCO indicates the peak of infection on 10 April 2020, less than 100 active cases by 8 July 2020, less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, and close to zero daily new case by 22 July 2020, with a total of 6562 infected cases. In the absence of MCO, the model predicts the peak of infection on 1 May 2020, less than 100 active cases by 14 February 2021, less than 10 active cases by 26 April 2021 and close to zero daily new case by 6 October 2020, with a total of 1.6 million infected cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that the present MCO has significantly reduced the number of susceptible population and the total number of infected cases. The method to fit the SIR model used in this study was found to be accurate in reflecting the observed data. The method can be used to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in other countries.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wan Nor Arifin","author_inst":"Universiti Sains Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Weng Howe Chan","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Safiya Amaran","author_inst":"Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin"},{"author_name":"Kamarul Imran Musa","author_inst":"Universiti Sains Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Camille Pouchol","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vayatis","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, ENS Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Centre Borelli"},{"author_name":"Susan Alexandra Lanham-New","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Cyrus Cooper","author_inst":"University of Southampton\/University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David J Blackbourn","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Gwenan M Knight","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masoumeh Lotfi-Tokaldany","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyedeh Hamideh Mortazavi","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Afsaneh Aein","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tahere Ahmadian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saeed Sadeghian","author_inst":"Tehran Heart Center, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"forensic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20085290","rel_title":"Group testing for SARS-CoV-2 allows for up to 10-fold efficiency increase across realistic scenarios and testing strategies","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20085290","rel_abs":"Background: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, demand for diagnostic testing has increased drastically, resulting in shortages of necessary materials to conduct the tests and overwhelming the capacity of testing laboratories. The supply scarcity and capacity limits affect test administration: priority must be given to hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals, which can prevent the identification of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals and hence effective tracking and tracing policies. We describe optimized group testing strategies applicable to SARS-CoV-2 tests in scenarios tailored to the current COVID-19 pandemic and assess significant gains compared to individual testing. Methods: We account for biochemically realistic scenarios in the context of dilution effects on SARS-CoV-2 samples and consider evidence on specificity and sensitivity of PCR-based tests for the novel coronavirus. Because of the current uncertainty and the temporal and spatial changes in the prevalence regime, we provide analysis for a number of realistic scenarios and propose fast and reliable strategies for massive testing procedures. Findings: We find significant efficiency gaps between different group testing strategies in realistic scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 testing, highlighting the need for an informed decision of the pooling protocol depending on estimated prevalence, target specificity, and high- vs. low-risk population. For example, using one of the presented methods, all 1.47 million inhabitants of Munich, Germany, could be tested using only around 141 thousand tests if the infection rate is below 0.4% is assumed. Using 1 million tests, the 6.69 million inhabitants from the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, could be tested as long as the infection rate does not exceed 1%. Interpretation: Altogether this work may help provide a basis for efficient upscaling of current testing procedures, taking the population heterogeneity into account and fine grained towards the desired study populations, e.g. cross-sectional versus health-care workers and adapted mixtures thereof.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio M.

Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2. Methods: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw. Results: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 98.1% and 98.6%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection. Conclusion: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests.

We performed an observational study among patients presenting to hospitals in Iran who were tested for 2019-nCoV viral RNA by rRT-PCR between the fourth week of February 2020 to the fourth week of March 2020. Frequency of symptoms, comorbidities, intubation, and mortality rates were compared between COVID-19 positive vs. negative patients. 96103 patients were tested from 879 hospitals. 18754 (19.5%) tested positive for COVID-19. Positive testing was more frequent in those 50 years or older. The prevalence of cough (54.5% vs. 49.7%), fever (49.5% vs. 44.7%), and respiratory distress (43.0% vs. 39.0%) but not hypoxia (46.9% vs. 56.7%) was higher in COVID-19 positive vs. negative patients (p<0.001 for all). More patients had cardiovascular diseases (10.6% vs. 9.5%, p<0.001) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (10.8% vs. 8.7%, p<0.001) among COVID-19 positive vs. negative patients. There were fewer patients with cancer (1.1%, vs. 1.4%, p<0.001), asthma (1.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or pregnant (0.4% vs. 0.6%, =0.001) in COVID-19 positive vs. negative groups.

Based on single-cell transcriptomes of nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from clinically well-characterized patients presenting with moderate and critical severities, we reveal the different types and states of airway epithelial cells that are vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In COVID-19 patients, we observed a two- to threefold increase of cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 within the airway epithelial cell compartment. ACE2 is upregulated in epithelial cells through Interferon signals by immune cells suggesting that the viral defense system may increase the number of potentially susceptible cells in the respiratory epithelium. Infected epithelial cells recruit and activate immune cells by chemokine signaling. Recruited T lymphocytes and inflammatory macrophages were hyperactivated and showed a strong interaction with epithelial cells. In critical patients, increased expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF in macrophages was identified as a likely cause of a hyperinflammatory lung pathology. Moreover, we observed exacerbated epithelial cell death, likely leading to lung injury and respiratory failure in fatal cases. Our study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and suggests an immunomodulatory therapy along the CCL2, CCL3\/CCR1 axis as promising option to prevent and treat critical course of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Lorenz Chua","author_inst":"Center for Digital Health, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and Charite -

This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and plasma concentrations of baloxavir marboxil and favipiravir in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Favipiravir and baloxavir acid were evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro before the trial initiation. We conducted an exploratory trial with 3 arms involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into baloxavir marboxil group, favipiravir group, and control group. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects with viral negative by Day 14 and the time from randomization to clinical improvement. Virus load reduction, blood drug concentration and clinical presentation were also observed. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 2000029544). Results: Baloxavir showed antiviral activity in vitro with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5.48 M comparable to arbidol and lopinavir, but favipiravir did not demonstrate significant antiviral activity up to 100 M. Thirty patients were enrolled. The percentage of patients who turned viral negative after 14-day treatment was 70%, 77%, and 100% in the baloxavir, favipiravir, and control group respectively, with the medians of time from randomization to clinical improvement was 14, 14 and 15 days, respectively. One reason for the lack of virological effect and clinical benefits may be due to insufficient concentrations of these drugs relative to their antiviral activities. Conclusions: Our findings do not support that adding either baloxavir or favipiravir under the trial dosages to the existing standard treatment.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Lou","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Liu","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bianca P Hennig","author_inst":"Center for Digital Health, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and Charite -

However, many medical professional societies recommended their continued use given the paucity of clinical evidence but there is need for an updated systematic review of latest clinical studies. Methods: A search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and various preprint servers for studies comparing clinical outcomes and mortality in COVID-19 patients on ACEI and\/or ARB. Results: A total of eight studies were included in the review. There were conflicting findings reported in several studies as Meng J. et al, Liu Y. et al and Feng Y. reported that patients on ACE inhibitors\/ARB had lower rates of severe outcomes whereas Richardson S. et al reported higher rates of invasive ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in patients on ACE inhibitors\/ARB as compared to non-users. However, Zhang P. et al found slightly higher rates of ICU admissions in patients on ACE inhibitors and ARB as compared to non-users. Similarly, there were conflicting results in the rate of mortality reported by the various clinical studies as well. Meng J. et al, Li J. et al and Zhang P. et al reported lower rates of mortality in ACE inhibitors\/ARB users versus non-users whereas Guo J. et al reported higher rates of mortality in patients on ACE inhibitors\/ARB as compared to non-users. Additionally, a large study conducted in New York by Richardson S. et al raised concerns with worse mortality outcomes in patients on ACEI\/ ARB. Conclusion: It is concluded that ACEI and ARB should be continued in COVID-19 patients, albeit while exercising caution until larger clinical studies and randomized controlled trials confirm their safety. Additionally, the individual patient factors like ACE2 polymorphisms which might confer higher risk of adverse outcomes need to be evaluated further.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhinav Grover","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Mansi Oberoi","author_inst":"Internal Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sanford School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bianca P Hennig","author_inst":"Center for Digital Health, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and Charite -

The effectiveness of these mitigation measures is highly dependent on cooperation and compliance of all members of society. The knowledge, attitudes and practices people hold toward the disease play an integral role in determining a society's readiness to accept behavioural change measures from health authorities. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge levels, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 among the Malaysian public. A cross-sectional online survey of 4,850 Malaysian residents was conducted between 27th March and 3rd April 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking recautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma MW Mohamad","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"Arina Anis Azlan","author_inst":"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Rezal Hamzah","author_inst":"Universiti Malaysia Perlis"},{"author_name":"Jen Sern Tham","author_inst":"Universiti Putra Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Suffian Hadi Ayub","author_inst":"Sunway University Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Fabian Pott","author_inst":"Institute of Viroloy, Charite -

We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France). Methods: An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13th, 2020 for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features and outcome. Data extraction was done on April 25th, 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT-scan abnormalities. Results: Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N=41) or typical radiologic signs: 37\/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13\/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and\/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45\/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10\/59 (17%) were still followed and 4\/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (>70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and\/or death. Conclusions: This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment.

However, effective indicators are still lacking to predict the severity of the disease. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of 16 COVID-19 patients and found that the absolute counts of three T-cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) were significantly lower in the moderate and severe patients than those in mild patients and were significantly lower in severe patients than in moderate patients on admission. With the recovery of the COVID-19, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, PCT, and IL6) of moderate and severe patients gradually decreased. In contrast, the counts of lymphocytes and their subsets including CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells gradually increased in severe patients, and eventually showed comparable levels with moderate patients. ROC analysis showed that the counts of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells with AUC > 0.9 have potential values for predicting the severity of COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the reduction of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells is related to the severity of COVID-19 and dynamic detection of these T-lymphocyte subsets may help predict the outcome of the patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingrong Wang","author_inst":"First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province"},{"author_name":"Xingqi Dong","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Boting Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Xinping Yang","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Zhi Li","author_inst":"First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province"},{"author_name":"Xicheng Wang","author_inst":"Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shuguang Zuo","author_inst":"Kaifeng Kangbien Medical Laboratory"},{"author_name":"AliAkbar Kabiri","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Songhua Hu","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Enora Laas","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Youlia Kirova","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Luc Cabel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Jean-Yves Pierga","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Institut Curie Breast Cancer and COVID Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"INSERM U900"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Johannes Liebig","author_inst":"Center for Digital Health, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and Charite -

Design:Retrospective case series. Setting:Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants:From 4 February to 14 April 2020, 106 patients with neurological diseases were enrolled from all patients in the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 and divided into a severe group and a nonsevere group according to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Main outcome measures:Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imaging findings, and treatment methods were all retrieved through an electronic medical records system and recorded in spreadsheets. Results:The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of patients was 72.7 (11.8) years, and 64 patients were male (60.4%). Among patients with co-morbid neurological diseases, 81 had a previous cerebral infarction (76.4%), 20 had dementia (18.9%), 10 had acute cerebral infarction (9.4%), 5 had sequelae of cerebral haemorrhage (4.7%), 4 had intracranial mass lesions (3.8%), 3 had epilepsy (2.8%), 2 had Parkinsons disease (1.9%), and 1 had myelopathy (0.9%). Fever (n = 62, 58.5%) was the most common symptom. The most common neurological symptoms were myalgia (n = 26, 24.5%), followed by extremity paralysis (n = 20, 18.9%), impaired consciousness (n = 17, 16%), and positive focal neurological signs (n = 42, 39.6%). Eight patients (7.5%) died. There were more patients with altered mental status in the severe group than in the non-severe group (6 [10.2%] vs. 0, P = 0.033). The inflammatory response in the severe group was more significant than that in the non-severe group. There were more patients taking anticoagulant drugs (25 [42.4%] vs. 4 [8.5%], P < 0.001) and sedative drugs (22 [37.3%] vs. 9 [19.1%], P = 0.041) in the severe group than in the non-severe group. Amid all 93 patients with cerebrovascular diseases, only 32 (34.4%) were taking aspirin, 13 (14%) taking clopidogrel, and 33 (35.5%) taking statins. Conclusions:Patients with COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases had an advanced age, a high rate of severe illness, and a high mortality rate. Among the neurological symptoms, altered mental status was more common in patients with severe COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rong Yin","author_inst":"Neurology Department of The 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of the PLA, Lanzhou, China;

The percentage of infected individuals who seroconvert is still an open question. In addition, it has been shown in some individuals that viral genome can still be detected at considerable time post symptom resolution. Here we investigated both seroconversion and PCR-positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in New York City. Methods: Individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened via PCR for presence of viral genome and via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. Results: All but three confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients seroconverted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike while only 37.4% of suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients seroconverted. PCR-positivity was detected up to 28 days from symptom resolution. Conclusions: Here we show that the vast majority of confirmed COVID19 patients seroconvert, potentially providing immunity to reinfection. We also report that in a large proportion of individuals, viral genome can be detected via PCR in the upper respiratory tract for weeks post symptom resolution, but it is unclear if this signal represents infectious virus.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ania Wajnberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Mayce Mansour","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emily Leven","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nicole M Bouvier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Arinsburg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jane Houldsworth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ian Baine","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Johannes Liebig","author_inst":"Center for Digital Health, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and Charite -

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and this risk is mitigated through the use of personal protective equipment such as N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs). The high demand for FFRs is not currently met by global supply chains, potentially placing HCWs at increased exposure risk. Effective FFR decontamination modalities exist, which could maintain respiratory protection for HCWs in the midst of the current pandemic, through the decontamination and re-use of FFRs. Here, we present a locally-implemented ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI)-based FFR decontamination pathway, utilizing a home-built UVGI array assembled entirely with previously existing components available at our institution. We provide recommendations on the construction of similar systems, as well as guidance and strategies towards successful institutional implementation of FFR decontamination.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Schnell","author_inst":"VA Portland Health Care System"},{"author_name":"Melanie J.

With substantial age and sex differences in CoViD-19 mortality, that number should be adjusted for the age-and-sex composition of the population as well as its total size. Following well-established practices in demography, this article discusses several period measures based on cumulative numbers of CoViD-19 deaths up to a point in time and illustrate them with weekly-updated data from 386 national and subnational populations. First is an unstandardized occurrence-exposure rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate. The peak estimate for New York exceeded the state most recent annual Crude Death Rate and remains the highest on record. Second, an indirectly standardized rate is shown to perform quite like a directly standardized rate but without requiring an age-and-sex breakdown of CoViD-19 deaths. Relative to the US, standardization lowers death rates in European populations and increases them in most other populations, with the highest standardized rates currently found in subnational Mexican and Peruvian populations. Last, projected end-of-the-year CoViD-19 death tallies can be translated into reductions in 2020 life expectancies, which could exceed two and a half years in Peru and Ecuador, and in various subnational entities from Baja California to Madrid and New York. To put these in perspective, the 1.5-year projected reduction for the US would bring 2020 life expectancy at birth to its lowest level since 2003 and induce its largest annual decline since World War II.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Heuveline","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Michael Tzen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Jane E.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 under different heat conditions and report that the virus is stable at 37 C for at least 24 hours. Heating at 56 C for 30 minutes, however, effectively inactivated the virus while preserved the stability of viral RNA in both human sera and sputum samples.
