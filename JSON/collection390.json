We evaluated the performance of LamPORE against RT-PCR using RNA extracted from spiked respiratory samples and from stored nose and throat swabs collected at two UK hospitals. The limit of detection of LamPORE was 7-10 genome copies\/microlitre of extracted RNA. This is above the limit achievable by RT-PCR but was not associated with a significant reduction of sensitivity in clinical samples. Positive clinical specimens came mostly from patients with acute symptomatic infection, and among these LamPORE had a diagnostic sensitivity of 99.1% (226\/228 [95% CI 96.9-99.9%]). Among negative clinical specimens, including 153 with other respiratory pathogens detected, LamPORE had a diagnostic specificity of 99.6% (278\/279 [98.0-100.0%]). Overall, 1.4% (7\/514 [0.5-2.9]) of samples produced an indeterminate result on first testing, and repeat LamPORE testing on the same RNA extract had a reproducibility of 96.8% (478\/494 [94.8-98.1]). This indicates that LamPORE has a similar performance to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, and offers a promising approach to high-throughput testing.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leon Peto","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gillian Rodger","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Daniel P Carter","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karen L Osman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Yavuz","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Katie Johnson","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Raza","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Parker","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Wyles","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Anita Justice","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alison Vaughan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hoosdally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole Stoesser","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David W Eyre","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Timothy EA Peto","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thushan I de Silva","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Derrick W Crook","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Cariad M Evans","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Steven T Pullan","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.23.20200030","rel_title":"Epidemiological characterization of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and positivity in subsequent RT-PCR tests in the United Arab Emirates","rel_date":"2020-09-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.23.20200030","rel_abs":"Background COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases could be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the identified COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases are yet to be characterized. In this study, we characterized the first cohort of COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases reported in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE, according to symptomatic state, and identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. Also, the strength of association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was examined and quantified. Method We analyzed data collected from the first cohort of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the health authorities in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE between February 28 and April 08, 2020. Self-reported sociodemographic, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 1,249 COVID-19 cases were analyzed according to symptomatic state (symptomatic and asymptomatic). After the first RT-PCR confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent testing rounds were also analyzed. Results A total of 791 confirmed cases with a mean age of 35.6 years (range: 1-81 years) and information on the symptomatic state were analyzed. Nearly, 56.0% were asymptomatic cases. The most frequent two symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). The mean age of symptomatic (36.3 year, 12.6SD) was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases (34.5 year, 12.7SD). Compared to non-working populations, working in public places (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in the aviation and tourism sector (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40), were independently associated with the symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 5% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared to asymptomatic, symptomatic COVID-19 cases had consistent odds of two or more of testing positive to COVID-19 in three subsequent testing rounds. Conclusions A substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi Emirate was asymptomatic. Quarantine of asymptomatic cases along with prevention measures and raising awareness of populations working in high-risk settings is warranted. Further, follow up research is needed to understand viral clearance and clinical outcomes according to the symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rami H.

Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1\/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6\/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5\/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units\/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6\/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases were searched to include studies conducted between January 1, 2020, and July 15, 2020 which reported data about clinical characteristics and laboratory findings in laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Random effects meta-analysis using generalized linear mixed models was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: The most prevalent symptom of COVID-19 in children was 46.17% (95%CI 39.18-53.33%), followed by cough (40.15%, 95%CI 34.56-46.02%). Less common symptoms were found to be dyspnea, vomiting, nasal congestion\/rhinorrhea, diarrhea, sore throat\/pharyngeal congestion, headache, and fatigue. The prevalence of asymptomatic children was 17.19% (95%CI 11.02-25.82%). The most prevalent laboratory findings in COVID-19 children were elevated Creatinine Kinase (26.86%, 95%CI 16.15-41.19%) and neutropenia (25.76%, 95%CI 13.96-42.58%). These were followed by elevated LDH, thrombocytosis, lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated D Dimer, Elevated CRP, elevated ESR, leukocytosis, elevated AST and leukopenia. There was a low prevalence of elevated ALT and lymphopenia in children with COVID- 19.

We evaluated the performance of two commercially-available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC) (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Patients and Methods: Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). Results: Overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM and 92.2% for the NtAb assay. Sensitivity increased for all assays in sera collected beyond day 14 after symptoms onset (93.9%, 79.6%,93.9% and 93.9%, respectively). Reactivities equal to or more intense than the positive control line ([&ge;]2+) in the Wondfo assay had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 96.4% for high NtAb50 titers ([&ge;]1\/160). Conclusions: Our findings support the use of LFIC assays evaluated herein, particularly the Wondfo test, for COVID-19 diagnosis. We also find evidence that these rapid immunoassays can be used to predict high SARS-CoV-2-S NtAb50 titers.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arantxa Valdivia","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ignacio Torres","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Victor Latorre","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative System Biology, I2sysBio, Univeristat de Valencia-CSIC."},{"author_name":"Clara Frances-Gomez","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative System Biology, I2sysBio, Univeristat de Valencia-CSIC."},{"author_name":"Josep Ferrer","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Lorena Forque","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Rosa Costa","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carlos Solano de la Asuncion","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Dixie Huntley","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Roberto Gozalbo-Rovira","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Javier Buesa","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Estela Gimenez","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jesus Rodriguez-Diaz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ron Geller","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative System Biology, I2sysBio, Univeristat de Valencia-CSIC."},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Kathryn Stephenson","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dan Barouch","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen De Rosa","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kristen Cohen","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Juliana McElrath","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Cormier","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Gert Scheper","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Jenny Hendriks","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Frank Struyf","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Macaya Douoguih","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Johan Van Hoof","author_inst":"Janssen"},{"author_name":"Hanneke Schuitemaker","author_inst":"Janssen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.24.20200048","rel_title":"Genetic mechanisms of critical illness in Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-09-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.24.20200048","rel_abs":"The subset of patients who develop critical illness in Covid-19 have extensive inflammation affecting the lungs and are strikingly different from other patients: immunosuppressive therapy benefits critically-ill patients, but may harm some non-critical cases. Since susceptibility to life-threatening infections and immune-mediated diseases are both strongly heritable traits, we reasoned that host genetic variation may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development in Covid-19. GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care, genomicc.org) is a global collaborative study to understand the genetic basis of critical illness. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2790 critically-ill Covid-19 patients from 208 UK intensive care units (ICUs), representing >95% of all ICU beds. Random controls were drawn from three distinct UK population studies. We identify and replicate several novel genome-wide significant associations including variants chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 x 10-12), within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), and at chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, P = 4.99 x 10-8) in the interferon receptor IFNAR2. Consistent with our focus on extreme disease in younger patients with less comorbidity, we detect a stronger signal at the known 3p21.31 locus than previous studies (rs73064425, P = 1.2 x 10-27). We identify potential targets for repurposing of existing licensed medications. Using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease. Transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte\/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19. We detected genome-wide significant gene-level associations for genes with central roles in viral restriction (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3). These results identify specific loci associated with life-threatening disease, and potential targets for host-directed therapies. Randomised clinical trials will be necessary before any change to clinical practice.","rel_num_authors":59,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erola Pairo-Castineira","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sara Clohisey","author_inst":"The Roslin Institute"},{"author_name":"Lucija Klaric","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Andrew Bretherick","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Konrad Rawlik","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Nicholas Parkinson","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Dorota Pasko","author_inst":"Genomics England"},{"author_name":"Susan Walker","author_inst":"Genomics England"},{"author_name":"Anne Richmond","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Max Head Fourman","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Andy Law","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"James Furniss","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Elvina Gountouna","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Nicola Wrobel","author_inst":"Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility, Western General Hospital, University of Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Loukas Moutsianas","author_inst":"Genomics England"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Meynert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Zhijian Yang","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Ranran Zhai","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Chenqing Zheng","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Fiona Griffith","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Wilna Oosthuyzen","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Barbara Shih","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Se\u00e1n Keating","author_inst":"Intenstive Care Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 54 Little France Drive, Edinburgh, EH16 5SA, UK."},{"author_name":"Marie Zechner","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Chris Haley","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"David J Porteous","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Caroline Hayward","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."},{"author_name":"Charlotte Summers","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."},{"author_name":"Manu Shankar-Hari","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK;

Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India. Methods: We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. Findings: After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly due to lower UVB exposure. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lennart Kraft","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lucija Klaric","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Andrew Bretherick","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Konrad Rawlik","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Nicholas Parkinson","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Dorota Pasko","author_inst":"Genomics England"},{"author_name":"Susan Walker","author_inst":"Genomics England"},{"author_name":"Anne Richmond","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Max Head Fourman","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Andy Law","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"James Furniss","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Elvina Gountouna","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Nicola Wrobel","author_inst":"Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility, Western General Hospital, University of Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Loukas Moutsianas","author_inst":"Genomics England"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Meynert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Zhijian Yang","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Ranran Zhai","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Chenqing Zheng","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Fiona Griffith","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Wilna Oosthuyzen","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Barbara Shih","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Se\u00e1n Keating","author_inst":"Intenstive Care Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 54 Little France Drive, Edinburgh, EH16 5SA, UK."},{"author_name":"Marie Zechner","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Chris Haley","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"David J Porteous","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Caroline Hayward","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."},{"author_name":"Charlotte Summers","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."},{"author_name":"Manu Shankar-Hari","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK;

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a sample of COVID-19 inpatients across four different hospitals of Bangladesh between April 1st and June 30, 2020. Variation in clinical characteristics, contact history, comorbidities, treatment pattern, and long-term complications were investigated. Results: There were 734 COVID-19 presentations in this study of which 19.8% of patients had diabetes. 76% were male and 85% of the patients had been administered with all vaccine doses during childhood. The most frequently occurring blood groups among patients with diabetes were B (+) ve (35%) and O (+) ve (31%). Among biochemical parameters, glucose, D-dimer, C- reactive protein (CRP) and Troponin levels were significantly elevated amidst the cohort with diabetes. The frequency of insulin dependent individuals increased three-fold during COVID-19. A number of COVID-19 patients with diabetes have been suffering from long term complications post recovery including pain, discomfort, memory loss and sleep disturbance. Conclusion: Individuals with diabetes have experienced severe manifestation of COVID-19 and post disease complications. Further in-depth studies focused on larger sample sizes are entailed to assess the relationships elaborately.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farhana Akter","author_inst":"Chittagong Medical College"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"H.

From China the virus has spread to 188 countries and regions worldwide, reaching the Sahel region on the 2nd of March 2020. Since whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is very crucial to understand the spreading dynamics of the ongoing pandemic, but only limited sequence data is available from the Sahel region to date, we have focused our efforts on generating the first Malian sequencing data available. Screening of 217 Malian patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 38 positive isolates from which 21 whole genome sequences were generated. Our analysis shows that both, the early A (19B) and the fast evolving B (20A\/C) clade, are present in Mali indicating multiple and independent introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 to the Sahel region.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bourema Kouriba","author_inst":"Centre d'Infectiologie Charles Merieux du Mali, Bamako, Mali"},{"author_name":"Angela Duerr","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Rehn","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Abdoul Karim Sangare","author_inst":"Centre d'Infectiologie Charles Merieux du Mali, Bamako, Mali"},{"author_name":"Brehima Youssouf Traoure","author_inst":"Centre d'Infectiologie Charles Merieux du Mali, Bamako, Mali"},{"author_name":"Malena S Bestehorn-Willmann","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Judicael LJ Ouedraogo","author_inst":"Centre d'Infectiologie Charles Merieux du Mali, Bamako, Mali"},{"author_name":"Asli Heitzer","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Sogodogo","author_inst":"Centre d'Infectiologie Charles Merieux du Mali, Bamako, Mali"},{"author_name":"Abderrhamane Maiga","author_inst":"Centre d'Infectiologie Charles Merieux du Mali, Bamako, Mali"},{"author_name":"Mathias C Walter","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fee Zimmermann","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Roman Woelfel","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus H Antwerpen","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Loukas Moutsianas","author_inst":"Genomics England"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Meynert","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK."},{"author_name":"Zhijian Yang","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Ranran Zhai","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Chenqing Zheng","author_inst":"Biostatistics Group, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Fiona Griffith","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Wilna Oosthuyzen","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Barbara Shih","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Se\u00e1n Keating","author_inst":"Intenstive Care Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 54 Little France Drive, Edinburgh, EH16 5SA, UK."},{"author_name":"Marie Zechner","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Chris Haley","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"David J Porteous","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Caroline Hayward","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinb"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."},{"author_name":"Charlotte Summers","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."},{"author_name":"Manu Shankar-Hari","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK;

This study aimed to investigate level of immunity in communities within this population as well as infection exposure required to achieve herd immunity. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and\/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and\/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean infection positivity was 69.5% (95% CI: 62.8-75.9%). Only five infections were ever severe and one was ever critical, an infection severity rate of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Conclusions: Based on an extended range of epidemiological measures, active infection is rare in these communities with limited if any sustainable infection transmission for clusters to occur. At least some CMW communities in Qatar have reached or nearly reached herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a proportion of ever infection of 65-70%.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Jeremijenko","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein H.

Consequently, the number of individuals placed into quarantine is increasing too. The large number of individuals in quarantine has high societal and economical costs. There is ongoing debate about the duration of quarantine, particularly since the fraction of individuals in quarantine who eventually test positive is perceived as being low. We present a mathematical model that uses empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects transmission. We use this model to examine two quarantine scenarios: traced contacts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and returning travellers. We quantify the impact of shortening the quarantine duration in terms of prevented transmission and the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine. We also consider the impact of i) test-and-release strategies; ii) reinforced hygiene measures upon release after a negative test; iii) the development of symptoms during quarantine; iv) the relationship between quarantine duration and adherence; and v) the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected. When considering the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine, we find that the diminishing impact of longer quarantine on transmission prevention may support a quarantine duration below 10 days. This ratio can be increased by implementing a test-and-release strategy, and this can be even further strengthened by reinforced hygiene measures post-release. We also find that unless a test-and-release strategy is considered, the fraction of individuals in quarantine that are infected does not affect the optimal duration of quarantine under our utility metric. Ultimately, we show that there are quarantine strategies based on a test-and-release protocol that, from an epidemiological viewpoint, perform almost as well as the standard 10 day quarantine, but with a lower cost in terms of person days spent in quarantine. This applies to both travellers and contacts, but the specifics depend on the context.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Ashcroft","author_inst":"Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sonja Lehtinen","author_inst":"Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel C Angst","author_inst":"Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Bonhoeffer","author_inst":"Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jameela Ali A.A.

The factors governing these figures were studied including temperature, standard mortality rates, territorial distribution, death due to all cases as well as the non-COVID deaths. A sharp increase in mortality figures was observed for the month of march and low temperature also had a role to play. However the difference when compared to previous 5 years was not significant as was expected at the start of the study. A single factor cannot be responsible for the total mortality figures in a region as is frequently predicted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carla Bietta","author_inst":"Epidemiology Department of Prevention, Azienda USL Umbria 1, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Mattia Morini","author_inst":"Voluntary collaboration  with UOSD Epidemiology Department of Prevention, Azienda USL Umbria 1, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Asiya Kamber Zaidi","author_inst":"Association Naso Sano , Umbria Regional Registry of volunteer activities, Corciano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Cozzolino","author_inst":"Hygiene and Public Health Service Department of Prevention, Azienda USL Umbria 1, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Founder and President, Association Naso Sano, Umbria Regional Registry of volunteer activities, Corciano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jameela Ali A.A.

Method: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 \"overall\" indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race\/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120 \"equity-related\" indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. Results: Overall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests, hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 53%, \"B\") than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, \"D\"). Only British Columbia and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' individual-level immigration status, race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care settings and detention facilities. Conclusion: Socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada. However, several best practices in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Blair","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kahiye Warsame","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Harsh Naik","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Walter Byrne","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abtin Parnia","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arjumand Siddiqi","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health; Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, USA"},{"author_name":"Nasser Ali Asad Al-Ansari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Al-Mohammed","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naema Hassan Abdulla Al Molawi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Huda Mohamad Al Naomi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

The knowledge of the epidemiological\/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. Methods: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe, 2020) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26 to August 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. Results: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the mortality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with heart disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high mortality rate of around 50% was observed. The ICU admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Sumika Hojo Souza","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Nat\u00e1lia Satchiko Hojo-Souza","author_inst":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Ben D\u00eaivide de Oliveira Batista","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Cristiano Maciel da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ludovico Guidoni","author_inst":"Federal University of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del-Rei"},{"author_name":"Arjumand Siddiqi","author_inst":"University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health; Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, USA"},{"author_name":"Nasser Ali Asad Al-Ansari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Al-Mohammed","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naema Hassan Abdulla Al Molawi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Huda Mohamad Al Naomi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

We performed basic integrity checks of the FeverIQ dataset, such as by comparing it to other publicly released data. We then trained a linear classifier on diagnosis scores which were computed securely, without unprotected symptom data ever leaving a user's phone or computer. FeverIQ is currently the world's largest application of SMC in a health context, demonstrating the practicality of privacy-preserving analytics for population-scale digital health interventions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ankit Ranjan","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Serena Li","author_inst":"Henry M.

We show that existing data are insufficient to establish a low (below 1\\%) probability of infection with high accuracy. The use of facemasks and social distancing could significantly decrease this risk.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Alfredo Anchordoqui","author_inst":"City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Eugene M.

Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. Methods: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9-12 of a national lockdown. Participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. Results: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. Conclusion: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lynn Williams","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Lesley Rollins","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"David Young","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Leanne Fleming","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Madeleine Grealy","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Xanne Janssen","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Alison Kirk","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Bradley MacDonald","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Paul Flowers","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Al-Mohammed","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naema Hassan Abdulla Al Molawi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Huda Mohamad Al Naomi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

Increasing infection rates in health professionals can lead to the collapse of the health system and further worsen the pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 in health workers in Sergipe, Brazil. Methods: The targeted tests involved health professionals working on the front line to combat COVID-19. The samples were collected in the month of June, in six hospital units in the state of Sergipe. Results: 471 health professionals were tested. Of these, 28 workers (5.95%) tested positive for IgM and 64 (13.59%) tested positive for IgG. 9 workers (1.91%) tested positive for IgM and were also positive for IgG. Discussion: Health workers must be monitored constantly, because if they are infected, they can spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members. Conclusion: Knowing the prevalence of antibodies to the virus in health workers is an important measure of viral spread control.

Consensus surrounding the epidemiology of respiratory failure has permitted a relatively good fit between the supply of ventilators and the demand. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for mechanical ventilators well beyond supply. Respiratory failure complicates most critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is characterized by highly heterogeneous pulmonary parenchymal involvement, profound hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular injury. The profound increase in the incidence of respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and those with the necessary skills to treat. While most traditional ventilators rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas mixture delivered to a patient, the current emergency climate has catalyzed alternative designs that might enable greater flexibility in terms of supply chain, manufacturing, storage and maintenance. Design considerations of these 'emergency response' ventilators have generally fallen into two categories: those that rely on mechanical compression of a known volume of gas and those powered by an internal compressor to deliver time cycled pressure- or volume-limited gas to the patient. The present work introduces a low-cost, ventilator designed and built in accordance with the Emergence Use guidance provided by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wherein an external gas supply feeds into the ventilator and time limited flow interruption guarantees tidal volume. The goal of this device is to allow a patient to be treated by a single ventilator platform, capable of supporting the various treatment paradigms during a potential COVID-19 related hospitalization. This is a unique aspect of this design as it attempts to become a one-device-one-visit solution to the problem. The device is designed as a single use ventilator that is sufficiently robust to treat a patient being mechanically ventilated. The overall design philosophy and its applicability in this new crisis-laden world view is first described, followed by both bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision, capability, safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ventilator is shown to perform in a range of critical requirements listed in the FDA emergency regulations and can safely and effectively ventilate a porcine subject. As of August 2020, only 13 emergency ventilators have been authorized by the FDA, and this work represents the first to publish animal data using the ventilator. This proof-of-concept provides support for this cost-effective, readily mass-produced ventilator that can be used to support patients when the demand for ventilators outstrips supply in hospital settings worldwide.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. This study aims to understand the perception of the public towards hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in August 2020 across the 36 states of Nigeria using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. The results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.87%). Most of the respondents (385, 74.47%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance is unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.12%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.27%). There are significant association with the respondents age and having reservations toward vaccination [{chi}2= 19.0389 P-value=0.00] and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance [{chi}2=24.3316 P-value=0.00]. Furthermore, geographical location and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine [{chi}2=13.7786 P-value=0.02] are significantly associated. Even though the majority of our respondents are willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine, our findings reiterate the need to reassure the public that any vaccine which becomes available is safe and effective.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yusuff Adebayo Adebisi","author_inst":"University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Aishat Jumoke Alaran","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Obasanjo Afolabi Bolarinwa","author_inst":"University of Kwazulu-Natal, Durban"},{"author_name":"Wuraola Akande-Sholabi","author_inst":"University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Don Eliseo Lucero-Prisno III","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Mauricio J Bustamante","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Brett Ley","author_inst":"Kaiser Pulmonology and Critical Care"},{"author_name":"Dwayne Free","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michel Maharbiz","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ryan Van Wert","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David N Cornfield","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David B Camarillo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"MAKSON GLEYDSON BRITO DE OLIVEIRA Sr.","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SERGIPE"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

We partially account for behavioral responses using Google mobility data. Our identification approach exploits variation in the timing of indoor face mask mandates staggered over two months in the 34 public health regions in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. We find that, in the first few weeks after implementation, mask mandates are associated with a reduction of 25 percent in the weekly number of new COVID-19 cases. Additional analysis with province-level data provides corroborating evidence. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that mandating indoor masks nationwide in early July could have reduced the weekly number of new cases in Canada by 25 to 40 percent in mid-August, which translates into 700 to 1,100 fewer cases per week.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Karaivanov","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Shih En Lu","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Shigeoka","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Cong Chen","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Pamplona","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Mauricio J Bustamante","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Brett Ley","author_inst":"Kaiser Pulmonology and Critical Care"},{"author_name":"Dwayne Free","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michel Maharbiz","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ryan Van Wert","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David N Cornfield","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David B Camarillo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"MAKSON GLEYDSON BRITO DE OLIVEIRA Sr.","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SERGIPE"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

The purpose of the review was to inform recommendations for rational use of PPE for emergency surgery staff, particularly in low resources environments where PPE shortages and high costs are expected to hamper the safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) and affect the care of trauma patients. Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure. Inclusion criteria: This review included systematic reviews, experimental and observational studies evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was considered, as well as evidence from other viral outbreaks summarised and discussed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The risk of bias assessment of the included studies was planned with the AMSTAR II tool for systematic reviews, the RoBII tool for randomised controlled trials, and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies. Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction tool and summarised narratively. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for grading the certainty of the evidence was followed. Results: We identified 17 systematic reviews that fulfilled our selection criteria and were included for synthesis. We did not identify randomised controlled trials during COVID-19 or studies additional to those included in the reviews that discussed other similar viral respiratory illnesses. Conclusions: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs in the hospital setting. N95 and N95 equivalent respirators provided more protection and were found to halve the risk of COVID-19 contagion in HCWs from moderate and high-risk environments. Eye protection also offers additional security and is associated with reduced incidence of contagion. These effects apply to emergency trauma care. Decontamination and reuse appear as feasible, cost-effective measures that would likely help overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks are associated with a reduced risk of coronaviruses respiratory illness when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments, especially in aerosol-generating procedures, N95 respirators are associated with a more significant reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dylan Paul Griswold","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Andres Gempeler","author_inst":"Fundacion Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Angelos Kolias","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Peter Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andres Rubiano","author_inst":"Universidad El Bosque"},{"author_name":"Mauricio J Bustamante","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Brett Ley","author_inst":"Kaiser Pulmonology and Critical Care"},{"author_name":"Dwayne Free","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michel Maharbiz","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ryan Van Wert","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David N Cornfield","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David B Camarillo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"MAKSON GLEYDSON BRITO DE OLIVEIRA Sr.","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SERGIPE"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

The objective of this study was to determine the health facility (HF) preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak from the perspective of RMNH providers and to determine what factors significantly predict this. An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from 1st to 21st July 2020 in Lagos state Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. Two hundred and fifty-six RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 39% felt moderate or extreme work-related burnout, 84% were moderately or extremely concerned about the availability of PPE and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were extremely satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation in the outcome variable. A one-unit increase in the level of satisfaction with the communication from HF management and level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness (OR 0.79-2.92, p<0.001 and 0.02-0.15 p<0.001 respectively). Adequate support of RMNH providers particularly provision of PPE and guidelines, appropriate communications about COVID-19 should be prioritised as part of health system preparedness.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles A Ameh","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aduragbemi A Banke-Thomas","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Mobolanle Balogun","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Lagos"},{"author_name":"Christian Chigozie Makwe","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Lagos"},{"author_name":"Bosede Afolabi","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Lagos"},{"author_name":"Mauricio J Bustamante","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Brett Ley","author_inst":"Kaiser Pulmonology and Critical Care"},{"author_name":"Dwayne Free","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michel Maharbiz","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ryan Van Wert","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David N Cornfield","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David B Camarillo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"MAKSON GLEYDSON BRITO DE OLIVEIRA Sr.","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SERGIPE"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

Therefore, predicting the number of deaths from the new coronavirus is an urgent task. The aim of the study is to analyze the factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rate in various countries, to predict direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation, and to estimate additional mortality during the pandemic based on the demographic data. The main research method is econometric modeling. Comparison of various data was also applied. The authors' calculations were based on data from the RSSS, the World Bank, as well as specialized sites with coronavirus statistics in Russia and in the world. A predictive estimation of the deceased number of people due to the pandemic in Russia was made. It is confirmed that the deaths proportion of the completed cases of the disease depends on the level of testing. It is shown that the revealed mortality of the disease depends on the proportion of completed cases, on the population age structure, and on how early the pandemic entered the country compared to the other countries. It is determined that the number of additional deaths due to the coronavirus is approximately 31 thousand people. The analysis revealed that the relatively low proportion of COVID in Russia is the result of a special approach to the cause of death determination. The mortality rate in Russia in April 2020 was about 3% higher than in April 2019. The share of the deceased health workers in the total coronavirus mortality in the Russian Federation is higher than in the developed countries, which indicates an underestimation of the data on COVID- 19 deaths in the Russian Federation, and the unsatisfactory quality of the Russian healthcare system. The number of direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation at the end of July was approximately 43 thousand people.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marina Lifshits","author_inst":"Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Natalia Neklyudova","author_inst":"Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia"},{"author_name":"Mobolanle Balogun","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Lagos"},{"author_name":"Christian Chigozie Makwe","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Lagos"},{"author_name":"Bosede Afolabi","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Lagos"},{"author_name":"Mauricio J Bustamante","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Brett Ley","author_inst":"Kaiser Pulmonology and Critical Care"},{"author_name":"Dwayne Free","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michel Maharbiz","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ryan Van Wert","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David N Cornfield","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David B Camarillo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"MAKSON GLEYDSON BRITO DE OLIVEIRA Sr.","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SERGIPE"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Reham Awni El Kahlout","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Imtiaz Gillani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer Ahmad Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anil George Thomas","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanaa Nafady-Hego","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation and Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nourah B M Younes","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hanan F.

The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assay ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test sensitivity and specificity as well as the kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811- 0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement (87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)) was observed at 15 days post-symptom onset. We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alcibiades Villarreal","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Giselle Rangel","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS"},{"author_name":"Digna Wong","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Carolina De La Guardia","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Britton","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Patricia L.

We report an aptamer-based SARS-CoV-2 salivary antigen assay employing only low-cost reagents ($3.20\/test) and an off-the-shelf glucometer. The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones providing an opportunity to integrate with contract tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic medical records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within one hour, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement). We propose that this approach can provide an inexpensive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic for distributed screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection at scale.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Naveen K Singh","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Partha Ray","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Aaron F Carlin","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Celestine Magallanes","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Sydney Morgan","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Louise C Laurent","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Eliah Aronoff-Spencer","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Drew A.

Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19 admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Individuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period. The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n=134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever (54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158 (93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly. Conclusions: Susceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more in comorbid males. These atypical patients require more clinical attention from the prospect of controlling mortality rate in Bangladesh.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayan Saha","author_inst":"Disease Biology and Molecular Epidemiology Research Group, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Moinul Ahsan","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, 250 Beded General Hospital Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tarek-Ul Quader","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Chittagong Medical College, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Umer Sharif Shohan","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Sabekun Naher","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Preya Dutta","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, BGC Trust University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Al-Shahriar Akash","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"H M Hamidullah Mehedi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, 250 Beded General Hospital Chittagong, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"A S M Arman Ullah Chowdhury","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, 250 Beded General Hospital Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Hasanul Karim","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, 250 Beded General Hospital Chittagong, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tazrina Rahman","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Chittagong Medical College, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Parvin","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Chittagong Medical College, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Dilcia Sambrano","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Yamitzel Zaldivar","author_inst":"GORGAS"},{"author_name":"Danilo Franco","author_inst":"GORGAS"},{"author_name":"Sandra Lopez Verges","author_inst":"GORGAS"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhang","author_inst":"CAS"},{"author_name":"Fanjing Fan","author_inst":"CAS"},{"author_name":"Baojun Wang","author_inst":"KEWEI"},{"author_name":"Xavier Saez-Llorens","author_inst":"CEVAXIN"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo DeAntonio","author_inst":"CEVAXIN"},{"author_name":"Ivonne Torres-Atencio","author_inst":"UP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Ortega-Barria","author_inst":"GSK"},{"author_name":"Rao Kosagisharaf","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Lleonart","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"Li Chong","author_inst":"CAS"},{"author_name":"Amador Goodridge","author_inst":"INDICASAT-AIP"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 SEROLOGY COLLABORATOR GROUP","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Sheikh Mohammad Al Thani","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bertollini","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Manu Shankar-Hari","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK;
