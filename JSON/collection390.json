Countries across the globe have been implementing preventive measures towards curbing the spread and impact of the virus. Thus, the present study was aimed at assessing compliance to prescribe preventive recommendations, the psychological effect of lockdown, and the source of information among Nigeria social media users. Methods: This research implemented an online cross-sectional survey using an unidentified online Google based questionnaire to elicit required information from potential respondents via social media channels such as WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram and Facebook. On these forums, an external link with google based questionnaire was shared with Nigerians social media users to participate from 1st to 31st April 2020 and we had 1,131 respondents who participated in the survey. Results: Age and respondent's scientific or non-scientific backgrounds were the socio-demographic variables associated with respondents having psychological challenges as P<0.05. However, none of the socio-demographic variables of the respondents were associated with compliance with the recommendations as P>0.05. Also, most (63.4%) of the respondents were stressed by the feelings associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as the expected majority (80.1%) sources information about the epidemics through social media platforms. Conclusion: Given numerous uncertainties surrounding the global COVID-19 pandemics, there is a need to continuously increase awareness through various media and ensure that people are highly complying with the preventive measures being put in place by relevant authorities. Also, palliative measures should be put in place to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Obasanjo Afolabi Bolarinwa","author_inst":"University of Kwazulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa; Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Olalekan Seun Olagunju","author_inst":"Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Tesleem Babalola","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20182592","rel_title":"Is there a correlation between pulmonary inflammation index with COVID-19 disease severity and outcome?","rel_date":"2020-09-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20182592","rel_abs":"Rational: the radiologic pulmonary inflammatory index (PII) may be used as early predictor of inflammation as laboratory assessments in COVID-19.

We evaluated new-onset or previous insomnia worsening (primary outcome), sleep quality, and duration (secondary outcomes). Results: A total of 4,384 health professionals from all regions of the country were included in the analysis (mean age: 44{+\/-}12 years, 76% females, 53.8% physicians). Overall, 55.7% were assisting patients with COVID-19, and 9.2% had a previous COVID-19 infection.

Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nu-cleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41\/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N{delta} (HD) and N{epsilon} (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Pavlova","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Diane L.

Here, pigs undergoing experimental inoculation are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at low levels. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at 11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the presence of secreted antibodies.

SARS-CoV-2 viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) is a potential target for drug design. Crystal and co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been solved, enabling the rational design of inhibitory compounds. In this study we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-2 and the highly similar SARS-CoV-1 crystal structures. We identified within the active site of the Mpro, in addition to the inhibitory ligands interaction with the catalytic C145, two key H-bond interactions with the conserved H163 and E166 residues. Both H-bond interactions are present in almost all co-crystals and are likely to occur also during the viral polypeptide cleavage process as suggested from docking of the Mpro cleavage recognition sequence. We screened in silico a library of 6,900 FDA-approved drugs (ChEMBL) and filtered using these key interactions and selected 29 non-covalent compounds predicted to bind to the protease. Additional screen, using DOCKovalent was carried out on DrugBank library (11,414 experimental and approved drugs) and resulted in 6 covalent compounds. The selected compounds from both screens were tested in vitro by a protease activity inhibition assay. Two compounds showed activity at the 50M concentration range. Our analysis and findings can facilitate and focus the development of highly potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alina Shitrit","author_inst":"The Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Zaidman","author_inst":"Department of Organic Chemistry Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ori Kalid","author_inst":"Pardes Hana, Israel"},{"author_name":"Itai Bloch","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, MIGAL-Galilee Research Institute, Kiryat-Shmona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dvir Doron","author_inst":"Chemical & Computational Toxicology, Non-Clinical Development, Global R&D, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Netanya, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tali Yarnizky","author_inst":"Tali Yarnizky Scientific Consulting, Maccabim-Reut, Israel"},{"author_name":"Idit Buch","author_inst":"Emendo Biotherapeutics Ltd.

The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same RBD surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies, and enable us to design escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same surface of the RBD but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allison J Greaney","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Tyler N Starr","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Pavlo Gilchuk","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Seth J Zost","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Andrea N Loes","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah K Hilton","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rachel Eguia","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Katharine HD Crawford","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Adam S Dingens","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel S Nargi","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Rachel E Sutton","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Naveenchandra Suryadevara","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Paul W Rothlauf","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Zhuoming Liu","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Sean PJ Whelan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.291757","rel_title":"Molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 spike affinity for human ACE2 receptor","rel_date":"2020-09-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.291757","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantially more infections, deaths, and economic disruptions than the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV. The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2s higher infectivity may lie in its host receptor recognition mechanism. This is because experiments show that the human ACE2 protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to CoV-2s spike protein 5-20 fold stronger than SARS-CoVs spike protein. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained and, in fact, a comparison of X-ray structures leads to an opposite proposition. To gain insight, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations indicate that CoV-2s higher affinity is due primarily to differences in specific spike residues that are local to the spike-ACE2 interface, although there are allosteric effects in binding. Comparative analysis of equilibrium simulations reveals that while both CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complexes have similar interfacial topologies, CoV-2s spike protein engages in greater numbers, combinatorics and probabilities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ACE2. We attribute CoV-2s higher affinity to these differences in polar contacts, and these findings also highlight the importance of thermal structural fluctuations in spike-ACE2 complexation. We anticipate that these findings will also inform the design of spike-ACE2 peptide blockers that, like in the cases of HIV and Influenza, can serve as antivirals.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian M.

The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis\/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric R.

Here we apply single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to hACE2, S opens sequentially into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate. Conformational preferences of convalescent plasma and antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either competition with hACE2 for binding to RBD or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry. Our findings inform on mechanisms of S recognition and conformations for immunogen design.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maolin Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Pradeep D.

Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications. Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265 biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession, PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA,TNF-{propto}, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2). These trends align with proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology. We explore these trends as we put forth a COVID-19 biomarker resource that will help researchers and diagnosticians alike.

Understanding anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in population with different genetic backgrounds and tracking the viral evolution are crucial for successful vaccine design. In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0 algorithm for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a key antigen that is targeted by both B cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601. Our analysis of 1000 S protein sequences from field isolates collected globally over the past few months identified three recurrent point mutations including L5F, D614G and G1124V. Differential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by corresponding HLA alleles were observed. Finally, our multiple alignment analysis indicated the absence of seasonal CoV induced cross-reactive CD8 T cells to drive these mutations. Our findings provided molecular explanations for the observation that individuals with certain HLA alleles such as B*44 are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studying anti-S protein specific CD8 T cell immunity in diverse genetic background is critical for better control and prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hailong Guo","author_inst":"none"},{"author_name":"Elisa Guo","author_inst":"none"},{"author_name":"Keith A Crandall","author_inst":"George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Robel Kahsay","author_inst":"George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Darren A.

At the start of term, students arrive from geographically diverse locations and potentially have higher numbers of social contacts than the general population, particularly if living in university halls of residence accommodation. Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding the potential spread of infection and are being actively used to inform policy about the management of COVID-19. Our aim was to provide a rapid review and appraisal of the literature on mathematical models investigating COVID-19 infection in a university setting. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, bioRxiv\/ medRxiv and sought expert input via social media to identify relevant papers. BioRxiv\/ medRxiv and PubMed\/Web of Science searches took place on 3 and 6 July 2020, respectively. Papers were restricted to English language. Screening of peer-reviewed and pre-print papers and contact with experts yielded five relevant papers - all of which were pre-prints. All models suggest a significant potential for transmission of COVID-19 in universities. Testing of symptomatic persons and screening of the university community regardless of symptoms, combined with isolation of infected individuals and effective contact tracing were critical for infection control in the absence of other mitigation interventions. When other mitigation interventions were considered (such as moving teaching online, social\/physical distancing, and the use of face coverings) the additional value of screening for infection control was limited. Multiple interventions will be needed to control infection spread within the university setting and the interaction with the wider community is an important consideration. Isolation of identified cases and quarantine of contacts is likely to lead to large numbers of students requiring educational, psychological and behavioural support and will likely have a large impact on the attendance of students (and staff), necessitating online options for teaching, even where in-person classes are taking place. Models were highly sensitive to assumptions in the parameters, including the number and type of individuals contacts, number of contacts traced, frequency of screening and delays in testing. Future models could aid policy decisions by considering the incremental benefit of multiple interventions and using empirical data on mixing within the university community and with the wider community where available. Universities will need to be able to adapt quickly to the evolving situation locally to support the health and wellbeing of the university and wider communities.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hannah Christensen","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Katy Turner","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Adam Trickey","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ross D Booton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Gibran Hemani","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Emily Nixon","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Caroline Relton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks Pollock","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jan Lukas Robertus","author_inst":"National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Gabrani","author_inst":"IBM Research Europe"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosen-Zvi","author_inst":"IBM Research Haifa"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Methods: We performed a survey addressed to patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives for the control of their autoimmune diseases. The survey was distributed with special attention to Spanish patient associations centred on autoimmune diseases and rheumatology and to the general population. A sample of untreated subjects was matched to the treated group according to sex, age range and incidence region. COVID-19 disease prevalence was compared between treated and untreated-matched control sample. Results: A total of 319 surveys of patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives were recovered for further analysis. The prevalence of declared COVID-19 status in the treated group was 5.3% and the mean prevalence among the untreated-matched groups was 3.4%. A community exposition to COVID-19 was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 in both, treated (17.0% vs. 3.2%; p-value<0.001) and untreated groups (13.4% vs. 1.1%; p-value=0.027). Conclusion: We did not find differences of reported COVID-19 cases between treated and untreated groups, indicating a lack of protection by regular administration of chloroquine and its derivative drugs on COVID-19 infection.

Objective: To gain insight into the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs working in elderly care settings. Design: Cross-sectional study among HCWs working in elderly care in the South-East of the Netherlands, testing for SARS-CoV-2, between March 31 and April 17, 2020. Setting: HCWs working in geriatric rehabilitation, somatic and psychogeriatric wards or small-scale living groups and district nursing, with a total of 5245 HCWs within 4 organisations. Participants: 621 HCWs with mild respiratory symptoms. Main Outcomes: Number of HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs, using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, N-gene, and RdRP. HCWs filled out a survey to collect information on symptoms and possible sources of infection. Results: 133\/615 (21.6%) HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 15.6 to 44.4% per elderly care organisation, and from 0 to 64.3% per separate location of the organizations, respectively. 74.6% of tested HCWs were nursing staff, 1.7% elderly care physicians, 20.3% other HCWs with patient contact and 3.4% HCWs without patient contact. In the univariate analysis, fever, runny or stuffy nose, anosmia, general malaise, myalgia, headache and ocular pain were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while gastro-intestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms, other than runny or stuffy nose were not. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity were contact with patients or colleagues with suspected or proven COVID-19. Whole genome sequencing of 22 samples in 2 facilities strongly suggests spread within facilities. Conclusions and Relevance: We found a high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs in nursing homes and district nursing, supporting the hypothesis of undetected spread within elderly care facilities. Structural testing of elderly care HCWs, including track and trace of contacts, should be performed to control this spread, even when only mild symptoms are present.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mirjam Jeanne Dorine Dautzenberg","author_inst":"Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Andrea Eikelenboom-Boskamp","author_inst":"Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Janssen","author_inst":"De Bedrijfspoli, Occupational Health and Safety Service"},{"author_name":"Miranda Drabbe","author_inst":"Zorggroep Maas en Waal"},{"author_name":"Ewoud de Jong","author_inst":"De Waalboog"},{"author_name":"Eefke Weesendorp","author_inst":"Wageningen Bioveterinary Research"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andreas Voss","author_inst":"Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks Pollock","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jan Lukas Robertus","author_inst":"National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Gabrani","author_inst":"IBM Research Europe"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosen-Zvi","author_inst":"IBM Research Haifa"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Objectives: To evaluate the degree of correlation between neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) binding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG levels measured by four commercial immunoassays in sera drawn from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients and Methods: Ninety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were assayed by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays. Results: Overall, the results obtained with the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test showed the highest agreement with the NtAb assay ({kappa}, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1). The most sensitive tests were the pseudotyped virus NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay (92.2% for both). Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Rho=0.73) and moderate for the remaining assays (Rho=0.48 to 0.59).

Conclusions: the suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arantxa Valdivia","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Torres","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Victor Latorre","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carla Frances-Gomez","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Eliseo Albert","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Roberto Gozalbo","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Alcaraz","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Javier Buesa","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jesus Rodriguez-Diaz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ron Geller","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Gabrani","author_inst":"IBM Research Europe"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosen-Zvi","author_inst":"IBM Research Haifa"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective, secondary database review study was conducted. The information was collected from an epidemiological surveillance activity in close contacts (co-inhabitants) in 52 households in Metropolitan Lima with only one member with COVID-19. A reevaluation was carried out in 10 households. Epidemiological and clinical variables were evaluated and its association with the result of the rapid serological test (presence of IgG, IgM or both). Results: Secondary cases were found in 40 households, which represents an average of 49.9% identification per household. A secondary attack rate of 53.0% (125 cases) was found among cohabitants, with 77.6% of cases being symptomatic (symptomatic \/ asymptomatic ratio: 3.5). The presence of fever and \/ or chills was found in 40.0% of people with a positive result, followed by a sore throat, in 39.2%. Ageusia and anosmia were present in 22.4% and 20.8% of cases, respectively. A reevaluation in 40 family members 33.6 +\/- 2.7 days after the first evaluation, show the persistence of positive IgM and IgG in the 20 positive cases in the first evaluation. Conclusion: Having a primary case of COVID-19 in home, the secondary attack rate of this infection is 53%; however, in a significant proportion of households evaluated there was no positive case, beyond the primary case. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics found in this case were in accordance with what has already been reported in other international series.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yolanda Angulo-Baz\u00e1n","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Gilmer Solis","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Joshi Acosta","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Fany Cardenas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Ana Jorge","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9sar Cabezas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Alcaraz","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Javier Buesa","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jesus Rodriguez-Diaz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ron Geller","author_inst":"Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"David Navarro","author_inst":"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Gabrani","author_inst":"IBM Research Europe"},{"author_name":"Michal Rosen-Zvi","author_inst":"IBM Research Haifa"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Laumaea","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Given the rapid and intense spread of SARS-CoV-2, digital contact tracing has emerged as a potential complementary tool to support containment and mitigation efforts. Early modelling studies highlighted the potential of digital contact tracing to break transmission chains, and Google and Apple subsequently developed the Exposure Notification (EN) framework, making it available to the vast majority of smartphones. A growing number of governments have launched or announced EN-based contact tracing apps, but their effectiveness remains unknown. Here, we report early findings of the digital contact tracing app deployment in Switzerland. We demonstrate proof-of-principle that digital contact tracing reaches exposed contacts, who then test positive for SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that digital contact tracing is an effective complementary tool for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Continued technical improvement and international compatibility can further increase the efficacy, particularly also across country borders.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcel Salath\u00e9","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Interfaculty Platform for Data and Computational Science (INPUT), University"},{"author_name":"Nanina Anderegg","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Daniele Antonioli","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Tala Ballouz","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Edouard Bugnion","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Srjan Capkun","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dennis Jackson","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sang-Il Kim","author_inst":"Federal Office of Public Health, Liebefeld, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"James Larus","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wouter Lueks","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Cedric Moullet","author_inst":"Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mathias Payer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20188003","rel_title":"The Geography of Excess Deaths in England during the Covid-19 pandemic: Longer term impacts and monthly dynamics","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20188003","rel_abs":"Physical social interaction relevant to the spread of infectious diseases occurs, by its nature, at a local level.

The second part examines monthly mortality dynamics in relation to predictions from a spatial SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model of infection introduced by Bisin and Moro (2020). The analysis indicates that during the peak months of the Covid-19 pandemic, a larger non-white population and higher social deprivation in an area were associated with higher excess mortality, particularly among men. Regarding dynamics, higher population density accelerated the growth in mortality during the upsurge in infection and increased its rate of decline after the peak of the epidemic, thereby producing a more peaked mortality profile. There is also evidence of a slower post-peak decline in mortality in more socially deprived areas but a more rapid decline in areas with a larger non-white population.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Breen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nanina Anderegg","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Daniele Antonioli","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Tala Ballouz","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Edouard Bugnion","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Srjan Capkun","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dennis Jackson","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sang-Il Kim","author_inst":"Federal Office of Public Health, Liebefeld, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"James Larus","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wouter Lueks","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Cedric Moullet","author_inst":"Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mathias Payer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.04.20188235","rel_title":"Trend prediction of COVID-19 based on ARIMA model in mainland of China","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188235","rel_abs":"Abstract: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has aroused widespread concern around the world and poses a severe threat to public health worldwide.

To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Design: Baseline data from a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Australia, 27th March to 12th June 2020. Participants: Australians aged 18+ years, employed in a paid job prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey. Main Outcome Measures: Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress. Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score <= 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results: 2,603 respondents including groups who had lost their job (N=541), were not working but remained employed (N=613), were working less (N=789) and whose work was unaffected (N=789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR=2.22-3.66), poor mental (AOR=1.78-2.27) and physical health (AOR=2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR=5.43-8.36), poor mental (AOR=1.92-4.53) and physical health (AOR=1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion: Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources. Responses that increase financial security and enhance social connections may partially alleviate the health impacts of work loss.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Griffiths","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Luke Sheehan","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Caryn Van Vreden","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Dennis Petrie","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Grant","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Peter Whiteford","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Sim","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Alex Collie","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Sang-Il Kim","author_inst":"Federal Office of Public Health, Liebefeld, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"James Larus","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wouter Lueks","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Cedric Moullet","author_inst":"Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mathias Payer","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20164947","rel_title":"Effectiveness of digital interventions to improve household and community infection prevention and control behaviours and to reduce incidence of respiratory and\/or gastro-intestinal infections: A rapid systematic review","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20164947","rel_abs":"Background Digital interventions have potential to efficiently support improved hygiene practices to reduce transmission of COVID-19. Objective To evaluate the evidence for digital interventions to improve hygiene practices within the community. Methods We reviewed articles published between 01 January 2000 and 26 May 2019 that presented a controlled trial of a digital intervention to improve hygiene behaviours in the community. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure and grey literature. Trials in hospitals were excluded, as were trials aiming at prevention of sexually transmitted infections; only target diseases with transmission mechanisms similar to COVID-19 (e.g. respiratory and gastrointestinal infections) were included. Trials had to evaluate a uniquely digital component of an intervention. Study designs were limited to randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time series analyses. Outcomes could be either incidence of infections or change in hygiene behaviours. The Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess study quality. Results We found seven studies that met the inclusion criteria. Six studies reported successfully improving self-reported hygiene behaviour or health outcomes, but only one of these six trials confirmed improvements using objective measures (reduced consultations and antibiotic prescriptions), Germ Defence. Settings included kindergartens, workplaces, and service station restrooms. Modes of delivery were diverse: WeChat, website, text messages, audio messages to mobiles, electronic billboards, and electronic personal care records. Four interventions targeted parents of young children with educational materials. Two targeted the general population; these also used behaviour change techniques or theory to inform the intervention. Only one trial had low risk of bias, Germ Defence; the most common concerns were lack of information about the randomisation, possible bias in reporting of behavioural outcomes, and lack of an analysis plan and possible selective reporting of results. Conclusion There was only one intervention that was judged to be at low risk of bias, Germ Defence, which reduced incidence and severity of illness, as confirmed by objective measures. Further evaluation is required to determine the effectiveness of the other interventions reviewed.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalie Gold","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK; Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yang Hu","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Denford","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School (PHS), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bristol; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ru-Yu Xia","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China"},{"author_name":"Lauren Towler","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Julia Groot","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Rachel Gledhill","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Merlin Willcox","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Ben Ainsworth","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Sascha Miller","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Moore","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Little","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Aml\u00f4t","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Chadborn","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20189449","rel_title":"Mitigation Strategies and Compliance in the Covid-19 Fight; How Much Compliance is Enough?","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20189449","rel_abs":"Today, with only 4% of the world's population, the U.S. is bearing a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections. Seeking to understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Drilling down to the state level, we create specific state indices suitable for the U.S. to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. In this, we build on the Oxford Stringency Index. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator to reduce the transmission, is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states. These are New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one; this is the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. States successful in combating the pandemic were able to achieve a suitable combination. Understanding of this relationship by the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swati Mukerjee","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Clifton Chow","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Mingfei Li","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Ru-Yu Xia","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China"},{"author_name":"Lauren Towler","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Julia Groot","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Rachel Gledhill","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Merlin Willcox","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Ben Ainsworth","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK"},{"author_name":"Sascha Miller","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Moore","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Little","author_inst":"Primary Care Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Aml\u00f4t","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Chadborn","author_inst":"Public Health England Behavioural Insights, Public Health England, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Yardley","author_inst":"School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Julien Riou","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Theresa Stadler","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Carmela Troncoso","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Effy Vayena","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Walther Mothes","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20187666","rel_title":"Gastrointestinal involvement attenuates COVID-19 severity and mortality","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20187666","rel_abs":"Given that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a prominent extrapulmonary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated the impact of GI infection on disease pathogenesis in three large cohorts of patients in the United States and Europe.

In a fourth cohort of COVID-19 patients in which GI biopsies were obtained, we identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) within small intestinal enterocytes for the first time in vivo but failed to obtain culturable virus. High dimensional analyses of GI tissues confirmed low levels of cellular inflammation in the GI lamina propria and an active downregulation of key inflammatory genes including IFNG, CXCL8, CXCL2 and IL1B among others. These data draw attention to organ-level heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis and highlight the role of the GI tract in attenuating SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation with related mortality benefit.","rel_num_authors":43,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra E Livanos","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Divya Jha","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Francesca Cossarini","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Ana S Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Minami Tokuyama","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tommaso L Parigi","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Irene Ramos","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Katie Dunleavy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Brian Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Dixon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Steven T Chen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Martinez-Delgado","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Satish Nagula","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Jason Reidy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Steven Naymagon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Ari Grinspan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Jawad Ahmad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Michael Tankelevich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Ronald Gordon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Keshav Sharma","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Graham J Britton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Alice Chen-Liaw","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Spindler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tamar Plitt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Pei Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Andrea Cerutti","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY;

Methods: We performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary hospitals in Spain, from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by Inverse Probability of the Treatment Weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab effect in patients receiving steroids during the 48h following inclusion was analyzed. Results: During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days (IQR 8-14). Global mortality was 23.7%. Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls (16.8% versus 31.5%, HR 0.514 [95CI 0.355-0.744], p<0.001; weighted HR 0.741 [95CI 0.619-0.887], p=0.001). Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment (RRR 46.7%). We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone (10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 [95CI 0.352-0.741], p=0.036; weighted HR 0.6 [95CI 0.449-0.804], p<0.001) (Interaction p=0.094). Conclusions: These results show that survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those not treated, and that tocilizumab effect adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated cases with COVID-19 during the first 48 hours of presenting with respiratory failure despite of oxygen therapy. Randomised controlled studies are needed to confirm these results.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Belen Ruiz-Antoran","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Aranzazu Sancho-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ferran Torres","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic, Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Victor Moreno-Torres","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Itziar de Pablo Lopez de Abechuco","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal"},{"author_name":"Paulina Garcia Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Torrecardenas"},{"author_name":"Francisco Abad-Santos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Clara Maria Rosso Fernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio"},{"author_name":"Ana Aldea-Perona","author_inst":"Consorcio Parc Salut Mar"},{"author_name":"Eva Montane","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Germans Trias i Pujol"},{"author_name":"Ruth M Aparicio-Hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Central de la Defensa Gomez Ulla"},{"author_name":"Roser LLop Rius","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge"},{"author_name":"Consuelo Pedros","author_inst":"Hospital General Universitari de Valencia"},{"author_name":"Paloma Gijon","author_inst":"Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez Carballo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Nuestra Senora Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Pedrosa Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerto Real"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Prada-Ramallal","author_inst":"Fundacion Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Santiago de Compostela (FIDIS)"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Cabrera Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Clinico San Carlos"},{"author_name":"Josefa Andrea Aguilar Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Costa del Sol Marbella"},{"author_name":"Rocio Sanjuan-Jimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Iveth Ortiz Barraza","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal"},{"author_name":"Enrique Sanchez Chica","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ana Fernandez-Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"- TOCICOV-study group.","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Matthew P Spindler","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Tamar Plitt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Pei Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Andrea Cerutti","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY;

Coronavirus lead pandemic is a new found disease with no gold standard diagnostic and therapeutic guideline across the globe. Amidst this scenario our aim is to develop a prediction model that makes mass screening easy on par with reducing strain on hospitals diagnostic facility and doctors alike. For this prediction model, a neural network based on Chest X-ray images has been developed. Alongside the aim is also to generate a case record form that would include prediction model result along with few other subclinical factors for generating disease identification. Once found positive then only it will proceed to RT-PCR for final validation. The objective was to provide a cheap alternative to RT-PCR for mass screening and to reduced burden on diagnostic facility by keeping RT-PCR only for final confirmation. Methods: Datasets of chest X-ray images gathered from across the globe has been used to test and train the network after proper dataset curing and augmentation. Results: The final neural network-based prediction model showed an accuracy of 81% with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 90%. The AUC score obtained is 93.7%. Discussion and Conclusion: The above results based on the existing datasets showcase our model capability to successfully distinguish patients based on Chest X-ray (a non-invasive tool) and along with the designed case record form it can significantly contribute in increasing hospitals monitoring and health care capability.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akash Bararia","author_inst":"Tata Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Abhirup Ghosh","author_inst":"Jio Platforms Ltd, Navi Mumbai"},{"author_name":"Chiranjit Bose","author_inst":"IPGME&R and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Debarati Bhar","author_inst":"R.

Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality. Methods. We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings. Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received [&ge;]2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation. We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among patients who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J DeVito","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian MacKenna","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Morton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy P Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anna Schultze","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William J Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Richard Croker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henry Drysdale","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Medicine and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"The Phoenix Partnership"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"William G Dixon","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Noam Harpaz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Silvio Danese","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Nikhil A Kumta","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Alessio Aghemo","author_inst":"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Petralia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Mehandru","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
