A total of 66 upper respiratory swabs, 51 feces, 56 urine and 56 plasma samples were sequentially collected from 23 patients in a designated hospital. The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healthy and negative for respiratory swabs. These results indicated that beside respiratory samples, intestinal samples (e.g. feces) should be recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19, especially before a patient discharge and for monitoring the relapse of discharged patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ning Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Center for Influenza Research and Early-warning (CASCIRE), Chinese Acad"},{"author_name":"Yuhuan Gong","author_inst":"Institutes of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, China"},{"author_name":"Fanping Meng","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

However, it is urgent to need the rapid and accurate detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based and nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Method: We retrospectively and observationally studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from Feb 17 to Mar 1, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time RT-PCR detection for COVID-19 patients. Results: Of 133 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no significant difference of gender and age among three subgroups. Overall, the positive ratio in IgM antibody test was higher than in RT-PCR detection. In RT-PCR detection, the positive ratio was 65.91%, 71.15%, and 67.57% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas, the positive ratio of IgM\/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.55%\/93.18%, 82.69%\/100%, and 72.97%\/97.30% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Moreover, the concentrations of antibodies were also measured in three subgroups. Conclusion: The IgM-IgG antibodies-based test exhibited a comparative superiority to the NAT for COVID-19 diagnosis, which provides an effective complement to the false negative results from NAT for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rui Liu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Gongli Hospital, the Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huan Han","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan Shereen","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhili Niu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kailang Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Luo","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Chengliang Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044693","rel_title":"Why estimating population-based case fatality rates during epidemics may be misleading","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044693","rel_abs":"Different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics can yield widely different results, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date. Using available data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and simple assumptions, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose a more systematic method to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and errors in the data.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas B\u00f6ttcher","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Mingtao Xia","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Tom Chou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan Shereen","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhili Niu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kailang Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Luo","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Chengliang Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040758","rel_title":"Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040758","rel_abs":"Aims: Studies have indicated that chloroquine (CQ) shows antagonism against COVID-19 in vitro. However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg\/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 31) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group. Significance: Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaowei Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jijia Hu","author_inst":"Renmin hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zongwei Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shan Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shoumeng Han","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Dandan Yan","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruhong Zhuang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ben Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Zhan Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chengliang Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20043075","rel_title":"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Depression and Anxiety of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20043075","rel_abs":"Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has raised international concern. Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored in our fight against it. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p<0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360p<0.05) symptoms among patients with COVID-19. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender ({beta}=1.446, p=0.034), age ({beta}=0.074, p=0.003), oxygen saturation ({beta} =-2.140, p=0.049), and social support ({beta} =-1.545, p=0.017) were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, age ({beta}=0.084, p=0.001), family infection with SARS-CoV-2 ({beta} =1.515, p=0.027) and social support ({beta} =-2.236, p<0.001) were the factors associated with depression. Conclusion: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 presented features of anxiety and depression.

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now should move from explaining that citizens should stay at home to what they can do at home. We need interventions that make staying at home and following public health protocols more desirable, or possibly even fun. These interventions could include virtual social interactions, such as online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, among others - all designed to reduce the boredom of being socially isolated for long periods of time and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations. Interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world, and staying inside wears on people.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soubhik Barari","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Stefano Caria","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Antonio Davola","author_inst":"Luiss Guido Carli University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Falco","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Thiemo Fetzer","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fiorin","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Lukas Hensel","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Andriy Ivchenko","author_inst":"Expilab Research"},{"author_name":"Jon Jachimowicz","author_inst":"Harvard Business School"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Gordon Kraft-Todd","author_inst":"Boston College"},{"author_name":"Alice Ledda","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary MacLennan","author_inst":"London School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Lucian Mutoi","author_inst":"University of Stirling"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20047217","rel_title":"Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

DESIGN: Update of a Cochrane review that included a meta-analysis of observational studies during the SARS outbreak of 2003. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous review; search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from October 2010 up to 1 April 2020; and forward and backward citation analysis. DATA SELECTION: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials of people of any age, testing the use of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing against standard practice, or a similar physical barrier. Outcomes included any acute respiratory illness and its related consequences. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. We used a generalised inverse variance method for pooling using a random-effects model and reported results with risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for influenza (Risk Ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.43). Harms were poorly reported and limited to discomfort with lower compliance. The only trial testing quarantining workers with household ILI contacts found a reduction in ILI cases, but increased risk of quarantined workers contracting influenza. All trials were conducted during seasonal ILI activity. CONCLUSIONS: Most included trials had poor design, reporting and sparse events. There was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation on the use of facial barriers without other measures. We found insufficient evidence for a difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators and limited evidence to support effectiveness of quarantine. Based on observational evidence from the previous SARS epidemic included in the previous version of our Cochrane review we recommend the use of masks combined with other measures.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Jefferson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Lubna A Al Ansari","author_inst":"Kind Saud University, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ghada Bawazeer","author_inst":"King Saud, University, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Elaine Beller","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Conly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Microbiology, Immunology & Infectious Diseases, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary and Alberta Health Services , Calgary,"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20045955","rel_title":"Medical treatment of 55 patients with COVID-19 from seven cities in northeast China who fully recovered: a single-center, retrospective, observational study","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20045955","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; no specific medication has been identified to date. We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This single-center, retrospective, and observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Demographic information, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and eight patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. Findings: All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all eight severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; four received lopinavir\/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all eight in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; two received linezolid). Moreover, seven patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and nine (16.36%) with immunomodulators. Interpretation: Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir\/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lichao Fan","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Na Li","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"Shenyang Sixth People's Hospita"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20045880","rel_title":"Presence of SARS-Coronavirus-2 in sewage","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20045880","rel_abs":"In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of cases shed SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with their faeces.

Our results offer the insightful into Vietnamese citizens responses in terms of using medical masks; even the uses of this method are still controversial. Our results are robust by performing Exploratory Factor Analysis for five features and further regressions.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Toan D Huynh","author_inst":"University of Economics HCMC"},{"author_name":"Leo Heijnen","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Goffe Elsinga","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ronald Italiaander","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046110","rel_title":"Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?Empirical Research Based on Prevention and Control Cases in China","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046110","rel_abs":"Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what's more, measures should be formulated according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shanlang Lin","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Junpei Huang","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Ziwen He","author_inst":"School of economics and management, tongji university"},{"author_name":"Dandan Zhan","author_inst":"251227468@qq.com"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20045187","rel_title":"How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20045187","rel_abs":"Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day.

The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early.

To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians were 60 years of age or older, 246167 (25.0%) 65 years and older, and 106121 (10.8%) 70 years or older. States in the US reported that a median 5470 licensed physicians (interquartile range [IQR], 2394 to 10108) were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2). Discussion: Older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohan Khera","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lovedeep Singh Dhingra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Snigdha Jain","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Harlan Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20043331","rel_title":"A Machine Learning Model Reveals Older Age and Delayed Hospitalization as Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20043331","rel_abs":"Objective: The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and significant mortality.

Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jit Sarkar","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Partha Chakrabarti","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Snigdha Jain","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Harlan Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.006213","rel_title":"Comparative Genomic Analysis of Rapidly Evolving SARS CoV-2 Viruses Reveal Mosaic Pattern of Phylogeographical Distribution","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.006213","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has spread worldwide emerging as a global pandemic. The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 60,000 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, their underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13-16 (ORF1b polyprotein) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from the USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication, indicating highly evolved viral strains circulating in the population of USA than other countries. Furthermore, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of the USA isolate (MT188341) leading to shift in amino acid frame from position 2540 onwards. Through the construction of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, we further revealed that multiple host proteins (PHB, PPP1CA, TGF-{beta}, SOCS3, STAT3, JAK1\/2, SMAD3, BCL2, CAV1 & SPECC1) are manipulated by the viral proteins (nsp2, PL-PRO, N-protein, ORF7a, M-S-ORF3a complex, nsp7-nsp8-nsp9-RdRp complex) for mediating host immune evasion. Thus, the replicative machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges which need to be considered for developing effective treatment strategies.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roshan Kumar","author_inst":"P.G.

The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. Based on the target cell model, SARS-CoV-2 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esteban Abelardo Hernandez Vargas","author_inst":"Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies"},{"author_name":"Jorge X.

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1{degrees}C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months.

Here we report the establishment and screening of genome-wide RNAi library and CRISPR library for the model megabat, Pteropus Alecto. We used the complementary RNAi and CRISPR libraries to interrogate Pteropus Alecto cells for infection with two different viruses, mumps virus and Influenza A virus, respectively. Screening results converged on the endocytosis pathway and the protein secretory pathway as required for both viral infections. Additionally, we revealed a general dependence of the C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene, MTHFD1, for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human cells. MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton potently blocked replication of several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

Objective: To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive. Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital: No. IRBID: TJ-20200320) Setting: A database of outpatients in Tongji Hospital (University Hospital) from 15 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. Patients: 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19 Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS-CoV-2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive. Results: Of the 1,324 outpatients who diagnosed of COVID-19, 633 patients tested positive in their first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (47.8%), with a mean age of 51 years (SD=14.9); the rest, which had a mean age of 47 years (SD=15.4), tested negative in the first test. Ground glass opacity in a CT imaging report was associated with a lower chance of false negatives (aOR, 0.56), and reduced the length of time window for testing positive by 26%. Consolidation was associated with a higher chance of false negatives (aOR, 1.57), and extended the length of time window for testing positive by 44%. In blood routine tests, basophils (aOR, 1.28) and eosinophils (aOR, 1.29) were associated with a higher chance of false negatives, and were found to extend the time window for testing positive by 23% and 41%, respectively. Age and gender also affected the significantly. Limitation: Data were generated in a large single-center study. Conclusion: Testing outcome and positive window of SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 patients were associated with CT imaging results, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms. Taking into account relevant information in CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms helped reduce a false negative testing outcome. The predictive AFT model, what we believe to be one of the first statistical models for predicting time window of SARS-CoV-2 detection, could help clinicians improve the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis, and hence, optimizes the timing of nucleic acid detection and alleviates the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits around the world.

Principal component analysis and Paired Wilcoxcon test suggested that a higher RNA concentration and A260\/A280 would be obtained using silicone swab.

Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation. Results: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves. Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days. In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days. In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration. Conclusions: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings. We recommend that schools implement a post-fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam Burns","author_inst":"Loyola University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gutfraind","author_inst":"Loyola University Medical Center; University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nan Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Applied Soil Biochemistry, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Li","author_inst":"Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Gansu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Zhang","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Li","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy of Gastrointestinal Tumor, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongren Ma","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Sto"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Ailin Luo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Peihua Niu","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Xuming Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xu Tan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.013920","rel_title":"Crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 9, Nsp9","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.013920","rel_abs":"Many of the proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate both viral replication and virulence. Current understanding suggests that Nsp9 is involved in viral genomic RNA reproduction. Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer. Together we have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure and identified a peptide-binding site that may warrant further study from the perspective of understanding Nsp9 function.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dene Littler","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Gully","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Rhys N Colson","author_inst":"Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Rossjohn","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Zhang","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Li","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy of Gastrointestinal Tumor, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongren Ma","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Sto"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province, Key Laboratory of Stomatology of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Northwest Minzu"},{"author_name":"Ailin Luo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Peihua Niu","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Xuming Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xu Tan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20045997","rel_title":"Development and external validation of a prognostic multivariable model on admission for hospitalized patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20045997","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and the ability to stratify the most vulnerable patients is vital. However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required. Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. Findings: The final model included age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 as independent predictors of mortality. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0.89) and external (c=0.98) validation. Internal calibration was excellent (calibration slope=1). External validation showed some over-prediction of risk in low-risk individuals and under-prediction of risk in high-risk individuals prior to recalibration. Recalibration of the intercept and slope led to excellent performance of the model in independent data. Interpretation: COVID-19 is a new disease and behaves differently from common critical illnesses. This study provides a new prediction model to identify patients with lethal COVID-19. Its practical reliance on commonly available parameters should improve usage of limited healthcare resources and patient survival rate.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xie","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Daniel Hungerford","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China"},{"author_name":"Simon T Abrams","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"},{"author_name":"Guozheng Wang","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Yishan Wang","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Hanyujie Kang","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Laura Bonnett","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruiqiang Zheng","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xuyan Li","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Tong","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Qiu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hock Toh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xu Tan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046136","rel_title":"EARLY ESTIMATION OF REPRODUCTION NUMBER OF COVID-19 IN VIETNAM","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046136","rel_abs":"Reproduction number is an epidemiologic indicator that reflects the contagiousness and transmissibility of infectious agents.

Methods 125 COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were classified into mild (93 cases) and severe (32 cases) groups, basing on their 3 to 7-days clinical outcomes. Patients' gender, age, comorbid with underlying diseases, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and subsequently analyzed with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods. Finally, we evaluate their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results Seventeen factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups. Next, only four factors, including the comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24\/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP >10mg\/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >250U\/liter), were found to be independently associated with the later disease development. Prognostic value analysis by ROC indicated that individual factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia, but that the combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increase the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). Three- or four-factors combinations, including elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, further increased the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission could independently predict the severe illness occurrence. Conclusions General clinical characteristics and laboratory tests, such as combinations consisting of elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, and detectable viral RNA in serum post-admission could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuijiang Cai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yueping Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Youxia Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinqiang Fan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Linghua Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunliang Lei","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengyu Hu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xilong Deng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Tong","author_inst":"Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Qiu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hock Toh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xu Tan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20044776","rel_title":"Electrophysiology in the time of coronavirus: coping with the great wave.","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20044776","rel_abs":"Aims: To chart the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activity of interventional electrophysiology services in affected regions. Methods: We reviewed the electrophysiology laboratory records in 3 affected cities: Wenzhou in China, Milan in Italy and London, United Kingdom. We interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff members. Results: There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, work-flow dropped to <5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In 2 of 3 centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a recovery from the restrictions in activity. Following an intense nationwide program of public health interventions, local transmission of COVID-19 ceased to be detectable after February 18th allowing the electrophysiology service to resume with a strict testing regime for all patients. Conclusion: Interventional electrophysiology is vulnerable to closure in times of great social difficulty including the COVID-19 pandemic. Intense public health intervention can permit suppression of local disease transmission allowing resumption of some normal activity.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Mazzone","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Lisa Leung","author_inst":"St George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Weiqian Lin","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Angelo","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Jun Ma","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Jin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Zaki Akhtar","author_inst":"St. George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Yuechun Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Paolo E Della Bella","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Jiafeng Lin","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Mark M Gallagher","author_inst":"St. George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Qiu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hock Toh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xu Tan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044404","rel_title":"Clear plastic drapes may be effective at limiting aerosolization and droplet spray during extubation: implications for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044404","rel_abs":"Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount.

This meta-analysis is to analyze the correlation between hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Available data from PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, WanFang Database and VIP Database, were analyzed using a fixed effects model meta-analysis to derive overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and Begg's were used to assess publication bias. Findings: Of 182 articles found following our initial search, we assessed 34 full-text articles, of which 9 articles with 1936 COVID-19 patients met all selection criteria for our meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity between studies. There were significant correlations between COVID-19 severity and hypertension [OR=2.3 [95% CI (1.76, 3.00), P<0.01], diabetes [OR=2.67, 95% CI (1.91, 3.74), P<0.01], coronary heart disease [OR=2.85 [95% CI (1.68, 4.84), P<0.01]. Most of the studies in the funnel plot are on the upper part and few on the base part, and are roughly symmetrical left and right. Begg's test: hypertension (Z=-0.1, P=1.0), diabetes (Z=0.73, P=0.466), coronary heart disease (Z=0.38, P=0.707), all found no publication bias. Interpretation: Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease can affect the severity of COVID-19. It may be related to the imbalance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the cytokine storm induced by Glucolipid metabolic disorders (GLMD).","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yingyu Chen","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University; Guangdong metabolic Diseases Research Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine; Key L"},{"author_name":"Xiao Gong","author_inst":"School of public health, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Lexun Wang","author_inst":"Guangdong metabolic Diseases Research Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine; Key Laboratory of Glucolipid Metabolic Disorder, Ministry of Education "},{"author_name":"Jiao Guo","author_inst":"Guangdong metabolic Diseases Research Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine; Key Laboratory of Glucolipid Metabolic Disorder, Ministry of Education "},{"author_name":"Giuseppe D'Angelo","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Jun Ma","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Jin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Zaki Akhtar","author_inst":"St. George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Yuechun Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Paolo E Della Bella","author_inst":"San Raffaele di Milano"},{"author_name":"Jiafeng Lin","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No.109 Xueyuan West Road, Lucheng Distric"},{"author_name":"Mark M Gallagher","author_inst":"St. George's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Jiangdu People's Hospital of Yangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Haibo Qiu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hock Toh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xu Tan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"}]}
