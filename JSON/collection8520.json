Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tapiwa Ganyani","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt)"},{"author_name":"Cecile Kremer","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt)"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands; Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrea Torneri","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt); University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Hasselt University (UHasselt)"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands; Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University; University of Antwerp"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20031740","rel_title":"A data-driven assessment of early travel restrictions related to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 within mainland China","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20031740","rel_abs":"Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Aleta","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qitong Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jiachen Ye","author_inst":"Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Peng Ji","author_inst":"Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yamir Moreno","author_inst":"Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), University of Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Jacco Wallinga","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands; Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University; University of Antwerp"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20031849","rel_title":"A mathematical model for estimating the age-specific transmissibility of a novel coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20031849","rel_abs":"Background: A novel coronavirus named as \"SARS-CoV-2\" has spread widely in many countries since December 2019, especially in China. This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: >= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups ({chi}2 = 4.99 x 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups ({chi}2 = 4.85 x 10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeyu Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Zhao Zhu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jing-Wen Xu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qing-Qing Hu","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Zhao Lei","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jia Rui","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xingchun Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yao Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Li Luo","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shan-Shan Yu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jia Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Yun Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Fang Xie","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ying-Ying Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chen Chiang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yanhua Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Benhua Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20031880","rel_title":"Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: Simulations Based on Air Traffic directly from Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20031880","rel_abs":"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies. Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03\/01\/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03\/01\/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03\/01\/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474). Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03\/01\/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dalin Li","author_inst":"IBIRI institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jun Lv","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory Botwin","author_inst":"IBIRI Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Braun","author_inst":"IBIRI Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Weihua Cao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Liming Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Dermot P.B.

However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huayan Xu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Keke Hou","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Hong Xu","author_inst":"West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenlin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huizhu Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Na Zhang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Rong Xu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hang Fu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Ran Sun","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Lingyi Wen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Linjun Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Kun Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Joseph B Selvanayagam","author_inst":"Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders University of South Australia"},{"author_name":"Chuan Fu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Shihua Zhao","author_inst":"Cardiac Imaging Center, Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases of China, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colle"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, Sichuan university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.20031401","rel_title":"Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.20031401","rel_abs":"Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 160 protocols. For protocols of TCM clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and almost half (34\/76, 44.74%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative. 27 (27\/76, 35.53%) outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 10 outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. For protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 126 outcomes from 17 outcome domains were reported; almost half (62\/126, 49.21%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was proportion of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2. 27 outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 40 (40\/126, 31.75%) outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. Conclusion: Outcome reporting in protocols of clinical trials of COVID-19 is inconsistent. Thus, developing a core outcome set is necessary.

There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. We aimed to explore risk factors affecting susceptibility to infection and prioritize drug repositioning candidates, based on Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on ACE2 lung expression. We conducted a phenome-wide MR study to prioritize diseases\/traits and blood proteins causally linked to ACE2 lung expression in GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR, as these drugs may alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. The most consistent finding was tentative evidence of an association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), T2DM was causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (p=2.91E-03;MR-IVW). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) with ACE2 expression was observed across multiple DM datasets and analytic methods, for type 1 and 2 diabetes and related traits including early start of insulin. Other diseases\/traits having nominal significant associations with increased expression included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT. We also identified drugs that may target the top-ranked proteins in MR, such as fostamatinib and zinc. In conclusion, our analysis suggested that diabetes and related traits may increase ACE2 expression, which may influence susceptibility to infection (or more severe infection). However, none of these findings withstood rigorous multiple testing corrections (at FDR<0.05). Proteome-wide MR analyses might help uncover mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression and guide drug repositioning. Further studies are required to verify our findings.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shitao Rao","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Alexandria Lau","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hon-Cheong So","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Changming Zhong","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Chen Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Basic Research In Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jiayuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Third Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ya Huang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Songjie Han","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Tianmai He","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Baokang Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin China"},{"author_name":"Hongcai Shang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Kun Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Joseph B Selvanayagam","author_inst":"Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders University of South Australia"},{"author_name":"Chuan Fu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Shihua Zhao","author_inst":"Cardiac Imaging Center, Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases of China, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colle"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, Sichuan university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20031518","rel_title":"Clinical characterization and chest CT findings in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20031518","rel_abs":"Background: Imagery techniques have been used as essential parts of diagnostic workup for patients suspected for 2019-nCoV infection, Multiple studies have reported the features of chest computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients. Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation.

Conclusion: The most CT-scan abnormality is Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just CT findings will lead to miss some patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Golnaz Vaseghi","author_inst":"Isfahan Cardiovascular research center, cardiovascular research institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Marjan Mansourian","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Health, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Raheleh Karimi","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Health, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Kiyan Heshmat-Ghahdarijani","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran"},{"author_name":"Sadegh Baradaran Mahdavi","author_inst":"Department of Physical Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran"},{"author_name":"Amirhossein Pezeshki","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran"},{"author_name":"Behrooz Ataei","author_inst":"Infectious disease and tropical medicine research center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alireza Zandifar","author_inst":"Applied physiology research center, cardiovascular research institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Omid Shafaat","author_inst":"Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shaghayegh Haghjoo Javanmard","author_inst":"Applied physiology research center, cardiovascular research institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Baokang Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin China"},{"author_name":"Hongcai Shang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Kun Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Joseph B Selvanayagam","author_inst":"Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders University of South Australia"},{"author_name":"Chuan Fu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Shihua Zhao","author_inst":"Cardiac Imaging Center, Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases of China, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colle"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, Sichuan university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20031278","rel_title":"The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers Under the Outbreak of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20031278","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in China remains to be a serious challenge for frontline medical workers (fMW). They are under high risk of being infected and high mental stress, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate sleep disturbances of fMW and made a comparison with non-fMW. The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or\/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Findings A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p<0.0001), AIS (p<0.0001), anxiety (p<0.0001) and depression (p=0.0010), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (p<0.0001) and AIS > 6 points (p<0.0001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p=0.022) and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (p<0.0001). Interpretation fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-fMW. Female fMW were more vulnerable to having sleep disturbances than male fMW.

Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible, and broader mitigation measures must be implemented. Methods: To estimate the comparative efficacy of these case-based interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit to the incubation period distribution and each of two sets of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4.8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7.5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we consider two feasibility settings: a high feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and low feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a two-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation. Findings: Our results suggest that individual quarantine in high feasibility settings where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined contains an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. When resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. Interpretation: Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts. To the extent these interventions can be implemented they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Corey M Peak","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roman Woelfel","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Guggemos","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Seilmaier","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sabine Zange","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Mueller","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Vollmar","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Camilla Rothe","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bleicker","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Bruenink","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Julia Schneider","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rosina Ehmann","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katrin Zwirglmaier","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Wendtner","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, Sichuan university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20031856","rel_title":"A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 admitted hospital patients","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20031856","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge for public health laboratories. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and\/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127\/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67\/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. Keywords.

Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Hernandez","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Milechin","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Shakti K Davis","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rich DeLaura","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kajal T Claypool","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Albert Swiston","author_inst":"MIT Lincoln Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Daniela Niemeyer","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Vollmar","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Camilla Rothe","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bleicker","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Bruenink","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Julia Schneider","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rosina Ehmann","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katrin Zwirglmaier","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Wendtner","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, Sichuan university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.20031773","rel_title":"Estimating the infection and case fatality ratio for COVID-19 using age-adjusted data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship","rel_date":"2020-03-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.20031773","rel_abs":"Adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-death, we estimated case and infection fatality ratios (CFR, IFR) for COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess ship as 1.2% (0.38-2.7%) and 2.3% (0.75%-5.3%).

These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongyue Wei","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sipeng Shen","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mingzhi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University Corresponding Email: fengchen@njmu.edu.cn"},{"author_name":"Feng Chen","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"CMMID nCov working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tobias Bleicker","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Bruenink","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Julia Schneider","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rosina Ehmann","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katrin Zwirglmaier","author_inst":"Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Wendtner","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, Sichuan university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.976167","rel_title":"Direct RNA sequencing and early evolution of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-03-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.976167","rel_abs":"Fundamental aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology remain to be described, having the potential to provide insight to the response effort for this high-priority pathogen.

The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Houcemeddine Othman","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa."},{"author_name":"Zied Bouslama","author_inst":"Laboratory of veterinary epidemiology and microbiology LR16IPT03.

Coronavirus has a history of causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 [A]. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which will facilitate to vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zied Bouslama","author_inst":"Laboratory of veterinary epidemiology and microbiology LR16IPT03.

By using genomic, sequence, structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongjun Tan","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Theresa Schneider","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Leong","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"L Aravind","author_inst":"NCBI, NLM, NIH"},{"author_name":"Dapeng Zhang","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Kais Ghedira","author_inst":"Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Biomathematics and Biostatistics - LR16IPT09, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia."},{"author_name":"Najet-Srairi Abid","author_inst":"Universite de Tunis El Manar, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LR11IPT08 Venins et Biomolecules Therapeutiques, 1002, Tunis, Tunisia."},{"author_name":"Scott Hazelhurst","author_inst":"Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences and School of Electrical and Information Engineering,  University of the Witwaters"},{"author_name":"Thomas Tran","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Jason Roberts","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nichollas Scott","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mike Catton","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Lachlan Coin","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Duchene","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clemens Wendtner","author_inst":"Klinikum Muenchen-Schwabing, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ming Yang","author_inst":"Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Yingkun Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of Ministry of Education, Sichuan university"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.05.979260","rel_title":"LY6E impairs coronavirus fusion and confers immune control of viral disease","rel_date":"2020-03-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.05.979260","rel_abs":"Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie Pfaender","author_inst":"Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Katrina B Mar","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Michailidis","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Annika Kratzel","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Dagny Hirt","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Wenchun Fan","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nadine Ebert","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Hanspeter Stalder","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kleine-Weber","author_inst":"University Gottingen"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"Deutsches Primatenzentrum GmbH"},{"author_name":"H.

While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vanessa M.

However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 [A] crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the {beta}-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sisi Kang","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mei Yang","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhongsi Hong","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 519000, Zhuhai, China"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Institution of South China Sea Ecology and Envir"},{"author_name":"Zhaoxia Huang","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxue Chen","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Suhua He","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ziliang Zhou","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhechong Zhou","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qiuyue Chen","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yan Yan","author_inst":"Molecular Imaging Center, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Changsheng Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Materia Medica, Institution of South China Sea Ecology and Envir"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shoudeng Chen","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mary Wight-Carter","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Natasha W Hanners","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stefan Pohlmann","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Tom Gallagher","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Daniel Todt","author_inst":"Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Gert Zimmer","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Charles M Rice","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"John W Schoggins","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Volker Thiel","author_inst":"University of Bern"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.976662","rel_title":"Genome-wide data inferring the evolution and population demography of the novel pneumonia coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)","rel_date":"2020-03-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.976662","rel_abs":"As the highly risk and infectious diseases, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses unprecedent challenges to global health. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, compared with the coronavirus carried by pangolins (Pangolin-CoV), the virus carried by bats (bat-RaTG13-CoV) has a closer relationship with SARS-CoV-2. The network results showed that SARS-CoV-2 had diverse haplotypes around the world by February 11. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from Huanan seafood market assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term.

This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients.

Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36\/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaowei Deng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiling Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxin Zhou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyuan Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yinzi Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Han Yan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yongli Zhang","author_inst":"Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Gong","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xianglin Wei","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were identified. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data from electronic medical records. Results Among 101 nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0), 59.4% were male, 79.2% had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4%), cardiovascular disease (22.8%), diabetes (20.8%) etc. The most common symptoms were fever (76.2%), cough (58.4%) and dyspnea (54.5%). Respiratory failure (99.0%), acute cardiac injury (52.5%), sepsis (40.6%) and acute kidney injury (23.8%) were most common complications. Compared with patients died after 3 days of admission, patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6.7*109\/L, P=0.001) and neutrophil count (8.9 vs 5.5*109\/L, P=0.001), longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040), higher D-dimer concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040), higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol\/L, P=0.042), lower oxygen saturation (85.0% vs 91.0%, P=0.008), and were more likely to suffer sepsis (52.1% vs 30.2%, P=0.025). Conclusions Older patients with underlying comorbidities suffering COVID-19 were at high risk of death. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of COVID-19 patients. Early development of sepsis was associated with the rapid disease progress to death.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiao Shi","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kailiang Zhao","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jia Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Jiang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Feng","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kaiping Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yupu Hong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Man Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Weixing Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xianglin Wei","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen, immune cell markers (CD8, CD68 and CD56) and the complement C5b-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the viral particles in kidneys were also investigated by transmission electronic microscope (EM). RESULTS 27.06% (23\/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively). H&E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. EM observation also demonstrated that viruses- like particles are visible in the kidneys. Viral infection not only induces CD68+ macrophages infiltrated into tubulointerstitium, but also enhances complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients. Viruses directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. The viruses not only have direct cytotoxicity, but also initiate CD68+ macrophage together with complement C5b-9 deposition to mediate tubular pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,   China"},{"author_name":"Chenhui Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Rongshuai Wang","author_inst":"Hubei Chongxin Judicial Expertise Center, Wuhan,China"},{"author_name":"Zeqing Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yingjun Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Huiming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province,China"},{"author_name":"Changsong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, 989th Hospital of PLA, Luoyang, Henan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Liu","author_inst":"Hubei Chongxin Judicial Expertise Center, Wuhan, Hubei province,  China"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,  China"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of  Central Theater Command, Wuhan,  China"},{"author_name":"Gang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zilin Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Center, General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Ren","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated. METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Tang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Danyan Xu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jia He","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Tang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shi Tai","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhi Wu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Ren","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan, Hubei province, China"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,China"},{"author_name":"Yongwen Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Peng Wu","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hon"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.
