Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. A negatively charged tetrapeptide (GluGluLeuGlu) is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites. We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site. Our work enhances understanding of the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, which may aid the design of therapeutics for COVID-19 infection.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY TOC:\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex showing the polybasic cleavage sites\n\nC_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baofu Qiao","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Monica Olvera de la Cruz","author_inst":"Northwestern University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120618","rel_title":"COVID19 REAL-WORLD DATA FOR THE US AND LESSONS TO RE-OPEN BUSINESSRevisedMEDRXIV\/2020\/109538","rel_date":"2020-06-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120618","rel_abs":"In March of 2020, the COVID19 pandemic had expanded to the United States of America (US). Companies designated as essential for the US had to maintain productivity in spite of the growing threat created by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. With this report, we present the response of one such company, the Lennar Corporation, a major homebuilder in the US. Within days, Lennar had implemented a morning health check via its enterprise resource planning system , to identify associates (employees) who were sick, or not in their usual state of health. With this survey, Lennar was able to ensure that no one sick would show up to work, and instead, would self-quarantine at home. Furthermore, with thorough contact tracking, associates exposed to COVID19 patients (suspected or RT-PCR test-confirmed), were also asked to self-quarantine. This survey, in addition to other safety measures, such as an overhaul of the company with nearly 50% of the company working from home, prolific communication, and many more measures, Lennar was able to function safely for its associates and successfully as an enterprise. The data that we present here are real world data collected in the context of working throughout a dreadful pandemic, and the lessons learned could be helpful to other companies that are preparing to return to work.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"pascal j goldschmidt-clermont","author_inst":"Lennar Corporation"},{"author_name":"Monica Olvera de la Cruz","author_inst":"Northwestern University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125856","rel_title":"Identification of multiple large deletions in ORF7a resulting in in-frame gene fusions in clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125856","rel_abs":"Peculiar among human RNA viruses, coronaviruses have large genomes containing accessory genes that are not required for replication.

Here we identify a consensus peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated Covid-19 patients who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The core signature conspicuously blended adaptive B cell responses typical of virus infection or vaccination with discrete traits hitherto associated with sepsis, including monocyte and dendritic cell dampening, and hyperactivation and depletion of discrete T cell subsets. This blending of immuno-protective and immuno-pathogenic potentials was exemplified by near-universal CXCL10\/IP10 upregulation, as occurred in SARS1 and MERS. Moreover, specific parameters including CXCL10\/IP10 over-expression, T cell proliferation, and basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion correlated, often prognostically, with Covid-19 progression, collectively composing a resource to inform SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and risk-based patient stratification.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam G.

This paper investigated the evolution of COVID 19 in five states of India (Maharashtra, UP, Gujrat, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi) from 1st April 2020 to 20th May 2020. Variation of doubling rate and reproduction number (from SIQR) with time is used to analyse the performance of the majorly affected Indian states. It has been determined that Uttar Pradesh is one of the best performers among five states with the doubling rate crossing 18 days as of 20th May. Tamil Nadu has witnessed the second wave of infections during the second week of May. Maharashtra is continuously improving at a steady rate with its doubling rate reaching to 12.67 days. Also these two states are performing below the national average in terms of infection doubling rate. Gujrat and Delhi have reported the doubling rate of 16.42 days and 15.49 days respectively. Comparison of these states has also been performed based on time-dependent reproduction number.

protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic is the N95 filtering facepiece respirator. N95 respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory pathogens, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and are increasingly employed by other frontline workers and the general public. Under routine circumstances, these masks are disposable, single-use items, but extended use and reuse practices have been broadly enacted to alleviate critical supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. While extended-time single use presents a low risk of pathogen transfer, repeated donning and doffing of potentially contaminated masks presents increased risk of pathogen transfer. Therefore, efficient and safe decontamination methods for N95 masks are needed to reduce the risk of reuse and mitigate local supply shortages. Here we review the available literature concerning use of germicidal ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light to decontaminate N95 masks. We propose a practical method for repeated point-of-use decontamination using commercially-available UV-C crosslinker boxes from molecular biology laboratories to expose each side of the mask to 800-1200 mJ\/cm2 of UV-C. We measure the dose that penetrated to the interior of the respirators and model the potential germicidal action on SARS-CoV-2. Our experimental results, in combination with modeled data, suggest that a two-minute UV-C treatment cycle should induce a >3-log-order reduction in viral bioburden on the surface of the respirators, and a 2-log order reduction throughout the interior. The resulting exposure is 100-fold less than the dose expected to damage the masks, facilitating repeated decontamination. As such, UV-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a practical strategy for small-scale point-of-use decontamination of N95s.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Huber","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Olivia Goldman","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Alexander E.

However, there is uncertainty in the effectiveness of such measures for specific regions with varying population demographics and different levels of adherence to social distancing. The objective of this paper is to determine the impact of social distancing measures in unique regions. Methods: We developed COVid-19 Agent-based simulation Model (COVAM), an agent-based simulation model (ABM) that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering population demographics, limited testing availability, imported infections from outside of the region, asymptomatic disease transmission, and adherence to social distancing measures. We adopted COVAM to represent COVID-19-associated events in Dane County, Wisconsin, Milwaukee metropolitan area, and New York City (NYC). We used COVAM to evaluate the impact of three different aspects of social distancing: 1) Adherence to social distancing measures; 2) timing of implementing social distancing; and 3) timing of easing social distancing. Results: We found that the timing of social distancing and adherence level had a major effect on COVID-19 occurrence. For example, in NYC, implementing social distancing measures on March 5, 2020 instead of March 12, 2020 would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from 191,984 to 43,968 as of May 30, whereas a 1-week delay in implementing such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases to 1,299,420. Easing social distancing measures on June 1, 2020 instead of June 15, 2020 in NYC would increase the total number of confirmed cases from 275,587 to 379,858 as of July 31. Conclusion: The timing of implementing social distancing measures, adherence to the measures, and timing of their easing have major effects on the number of COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oguzhan Alagoz","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Ajay Sethi","author_inst":"University of

As its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, the accurate and fast detection of the COVID-19 infection is crucial. Although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans, there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques. In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1-score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%). We further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance. At last, we design an automated deep learning methodology to generate a lightweight deep learning model MNas3DNet41 that achieves an accuracy of 87.14%, F1-score of 87.25%, and AUC of 0.957, which are on par with the best models made by AI experts. The automated deep learning design is a promising methodology that can help health-care professionals develop effective deep learning models using their private data sets.

knowledge on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and its evolution over time, related to control measures that have been taken, is tremendously important to guide policy makers aiming to control the epidemic wave. Objective To assess the evolving seroprevalence and seroincidence with regards to a national lock-down in Belgium. Design, setting and participants In this prospective serial cross-sectional nationwide seroprevalence study, stratified by age, sex and region, 3000-4000 residual samples were collected in each of five collection periods during and after national lockdown between 30 March and 5 July 2020. Residual sera from outside hospitals were randomly selected by diagnostic laboratories and analyzed for IgG antibodies against S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with a semi-quantitative commercial ELISA. Seropositivity (overall, by age category and sex) and seroincidence over 3 to 4 week periods were estimated for the Belgian population. Exposure Recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated in the Belgian population. Main outcomes and measures The primary study outcomes were the weighted seroprevalence and seroincidence against SARS-CoV-2 in the Belgian population during five consecutive periods in Belgium. Results The weighted overall seroprevalence initially increased from 2.9% (95% CI 2.3 to 3.6) to 6.0% (95% CI 5.1 to 7.1), implying a seroincidence of 3.1% (95% CI 1.9 to 4.3) between the 1st and 2nd collection period. Thereafter, seroprevalence stabilized and decreased from the 3rd to 5th period from 6.9% (95% CI 5.9 to 8.0) to 4.5% (95% CI 3.7 to 5.4). Conclusions and relevance During lockdown, an initial small but increasing fraction of the Belgian population showed serologically detectable signs of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which did not further increase when confinement measures eased and full lockdown was lifted. In combination with the reported COVID-19 cases in Belgium, the estimated seroprevalences reported in this study may have helped to calibrate the Belgian response to the epidemic's first wave and to guide policy makers to control for potential future waves. Seroprevalence estimates indicate that we are far from herd-immunity. Moreover, more research is needed to confirm if seropositivity correlates to protective immunity against the virus.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sereina

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to a rapid and deadly pandemic which reached almost all countries in the world in a few months. In most countries, rigorous measures of mitigation, including national or subnational lockdowns were established. The present work aimed at quantifying the effect of national lockdown in France on hospital occupancy. Methods. A compartmental model describing patient hospital flows was developed, where the effect of lockdown was quantified on the hospitalization rate. Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling. Results. French lockdown led to a hospitalization rate decreased by thrice from 12 days after its beginning. However, lockdown may not to have decreased either hospital occupancy or deaths in hospital, which would have been both decreased by 30% and 85% in average if lockdown was started 20 and 30 days before this date, respectively. Conclusion. The present work showed an intrinsic effect of lockdown to decrease hospital burden, but its efficacy on hospital burden may have been increased if established sooner.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Ternant","author_inst":"University of Tours"},{"author_name":"Jessie De Bie","author_inst":"University of

domestic violence (DV) hotlines across the globe suggest that there may be an increase of IPV prevalence in association with the COVID-19 outbreak; however, no study has investigated this phenomenon empirically. Objective: To evaluate the association between COVID-19 related conditions and recent use or experience of IPV (since the pandemic outbreak in the U.S). Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected online from a sample of noninstitutionalized adults (age 18+) in the U.S. (N=2,045). More than half of the sample self-identified as being in an intimate relationship at the time of the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: A four-item tool was used to assess IPV perpetration and victimization since the outbreak of COVID-19. The rapid tool inquired about two forms of IPV, psychological and physical. Participants self-reported demographic data and recent health histories, including COVID-19 tests results, related symptoms and degree of personal social distancing. We hypothesized that COVID-19 related factors would increase risks of IPV. Results: In this study, self-reported COVID-19 impacted respondents had an increased risk of IPV victimization and perpetration. Among those who reported having symptoms consistent with coronavirus, but were denied access to testing, psychological IPV victimization was 3 times greater than those who did not (Exp[B] =3.15, [1.19, 2.29] p <.05). For participants who reported testing positive to COVID-19, the odds of using psychological IPV (Exp[B] =3.24, [1.18, 8.89] p <.05) and physical IPV (Exp[B]=3.02, [1.12, 8.17] p <.05) against an intimate partner increased by more than 3 times. Conclusions and Relevance: Patient education and community outreach\/health care system initiatives focused on IPV risk behaviors may help reduce the potential development of IPV. Continued surveillance is imperative to improve health and well-being along with effective intervention development and implementation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxine

relationship pattern between COVID 19 daily cases with weather parameters and air pollutants in mainland India. We consider mean temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, wind speed, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO as independent variable and daily COVID 19 cases as dependent variable for 18 states during 18th march to 30th April, 2020.After dividing the dataset for 0 to 10 day, 10 to 25 days and 0 to 44 days, the current study applied Akaike s Information Criteria (AIC) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to examine the kind of relationship between independent variables with COVID 19 cases. Initially GAM model result shows variables like temperature and solar radiation has positive relation (p<0.05) in 0 to 10 days study with daily cases. In 25 days dataset it significantly shows that temperature has positive relation above 23 degree centigrade, SO2 has a negative relationship and relative humidity has negative (between 30% to 45% and > 60%) and a positive relationship (45% to 60%) with COVID 19 cases (p=0.05). 44 days dataset has six parameters includes temperature as positive, relative humidity as negative (between 0 to 45%) and then positive (after >45%), NO2 as Positive (0 to 35 microgram\/m3) followed by negative trend (after > 40 microgram\/m3), SO2 and rainfall as negative relation. After sensitive analysis, it is found that weather variables like relative humidity, solar radiation and rainfall are more sensitive than temperature and wind speed. Whereas pollutants like NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CO are more sensitive variables than SO2 in this study. In summary this study finds temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, SO2, PM2.5, and CO may be important factors associated with COVID 19 pandemic. Keywords: Weather parameter, Air pollutants, Daily COVID 19 cases, Akaike s Information Criteria (AIC), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Sensitive analysis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kousik Das","author_inst":"Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, West Bengal, India Pin: 721102"},{"author_name":"Nilanjana Das

sizes, show that stay-in-place-orders (SIPOs) are associated with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Our estimation approach relies on county-pairs across state-borders where one state has SIPO whereas the other state does not, controls for matched county-pair fixed effects and day of observation fixed-effects. The county-pair sample from southern, mid-western, and mountain region states (from March 1, 2020 to April 25, 2020) shows that daily COVID-19 incidence case growth rate is 1.994 percentage points lower for counties in SIPO states relative to those bordering in non-SIPO states. Specifically, we find SIPO reduced daily growth rates by 1.97, 2.14, 2.03, and 2.27 percentage points after 1 to 5 days, 6 to 10 days, 11 to 15 days, and 16 to 20 days, respectively. Our effect sizes are much smaller than in the previous studies with the caveat that states in the northeast and on the west coast could not be included in the border county-pair specification. We find limited evidence of heterogeneous effects in counties with a higher population density, percentage of black or Hispanic residents, proportion of population over 65 years, and social association rates in a county. Nor do we find evidence of meaningful differences in effects of SIPO by county Gini index, unemployment, or GDP. The results of this study could further inform policymakers in making decisions on SIPO extensions or lifting of such orders.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Srikant

Methods: We included 477 adult cases that died after admission from March 1 to March 31, 2020: 281 with confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 who died of other causes. Results: The number of comorbidities was high in the confirmed COVID-19, and CI was common (30%: 21.1% dementia; 8.9% mild cognitive impairment). Subjects with CI were older, more lived in nursing homes and had shorter times from symptom onset to death than those without CI. COVID-19 patients with CI were rarely admitted to the ICU and fewer received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, but palliative care was provided more often. Conclusions: Dementia is a frequent comorbidity in COVID-19 deceased patients. The burden of COVID-19 in the dementia community will be high.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paloma Martin-Jimenez","author_inst":"Department of Neurology.

These patients also develop cytokine storm syndrome, and organ dysfunctions, which is a clinical picture that resembles sepsis. Considering that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as an important factors of tissue damage in sepsis, we investigated whether NETs would be produced in COVID-19 patients and participate in the lung tissue damage. A cohort of 32 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and respective healthy controls were enrolled. NETs concentration was assessed by MPO-DNA PicoGreen assay or by confocal immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2-induced NETs was analyzed in human epithelial lung cells (A549 cells). The concentration of NETs was augmented in plasma and tracheal aspirate from COVID-19 patients and their neutrophils spontaneously released higher levels of NETs. NETs were also found in the lung tissue specimens from autopsies of COVID-19 patients. Notably, viable SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce in vitro release of NETs by healthy neutrophils in a PAD-4-dependent manner. Finally, NETs released by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils promote lung epithelial cell death in vitro. These results unravel a possible detrimental role of NETs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Therefore, the inhibition of NETs represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":43,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavio Protasio Veras","author_inst":"University of Sao

has become a major global pathogen in an astonishingly short period of time. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 also has been notable due to its impacts on individuals residing within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. SNF residents tend to possess several risk factors for the most severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities. Indeed, residents of long-term care facilities represent approximately 40 percent of US SARS-CoV-2 deaths. To assess the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among SNF workers, determine the extent of asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2, and provide information on the genomic epidemiology of the virus within these unique care settings, we sampled workers weekly at five SNFs in Colorado using nasopharyngeal swabs, determined the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus among these workers, and sequenced 48 nearly complete genomes. This manuscript reports results from the first five to six weeks of observation. Our data reveal a strikingly high degree of asymptomatic infection, a strong correlation between RNA detection and the presence of infectious virus in NP swabs, persistent RNA in a subset of individuals, and declining incidence over time. Our data suggests that asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to virus transmission within the workplace.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kendra

analyse transmission of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), their contribution to transmission is unclear. Viral load, as measured by RT-PCR, can inform considerations regarding transmission, especially if existing knowledge of viral load in other respiratory diseases is taken into account. RT-PCR threshold cycle data from 3303 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (out of 77,996 persons tested in total, drawn from across Germany) were analysed to examine the relationship between patient age and estimated viral load. Two PCR systems were used. In data from the PCR system predominantly used for community and cluster screening during the early phase of the epidemic (Roche LightCycler 480 II), when such screening was frequent practice, viral loads do not differ significantly in three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences in log10 viral loads between young and old estimated from raw viral load data and a Bayesian mixture model of gamma distributions collectively range between -0.11 and -0.43). Data from a second type of PCR system (Roche cobas 6800\/8800), introduced into diagnostic testing on March 16, 2020 and used during the time when household and other contact testing was reduced, show a credible but small difference in the three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences, measured as above, collectively range between -0.43 and -0.83). This small difference may be due to differential patterns of PCR instrument utilization rather than to an actual difference in viral load. Considering household transmission data on influenza, which has a similar viral load kinetic to SARS-CoV-2, the viral load differences between age groups observed in this study are likely to be of limited relevance. Combined data from both PCR instruments show that viral loads of at least 250,000 copies, a threshold we previously established for the isolation of infectious virus in cell culture at more than 5% probability, were present across the study period in 29.0% of kindergarten-aged patients 0-6 years old (n=38), 37.3% of those aged 0-19 (n=150), and in 51.4% of those aged 20 and above (n=3153). The differences in these fractions may also be due to differences in test utilization. We conclude that a considerable percentage of infected people in all age groups, including those who are pre- or mild-symptomatic, carry viral loads likely to represent infectivity. Based on these results and uncertainty about the remaining incidence, we recommend caution and careful monitoring during gradual lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In particular, there is little evidence from the present study to support suggestions that children may not be as infectious as adults.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Terry C

for patients with emerging infectious diseases often experience psychological distress. However, the psychological impact and behavior change of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among HCWs are still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the worries and concerns of HCWs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, a web-based questionnaire was distributed among HCWs working in hospitals or clinics across Japanese medical facilities from April 20 to May 1, 2020. The questionnaire comprised items on demographics, worries and concerns, perceptions regarding the sufficiency of information, and behavioral changes pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 4386 HCWs completed the survey; 1648 (64.7%) were aged 30-39 years, 2379 (54.2%) were male, and 782 (18.1%) were frontline HCWs, directly caring for patients with COVID-19 on a daily basis. 3500 HCWs (79.8%) indicated that they were seriously worried about the pandemic. The most frequent concern was the consequence of becoming infected on their family, work, and society (87.4%). Additionally, the majority (55.5%) had restricted social contact and almost all HCWs endorsed a shortage in personal protective equipment (median, 8\/9 (interquartile range; 7-9) on a Likert scale). There was no significant difference in the degree of worry between frontline and non-frontline HCWs (8\/9 (7-9) vs. 8\/9 (7-9), p=0.25). Frontline HCWs, compared to non-frontline HCWs, were more likely to have the need to avoid contact with families and friends (24.8% vs. 17.8%, p<0.001) and indicated that they cannot evade their professional duty during the COVID-19 pandemic (9\/9 (7-9) vs. 8\/9 (6-9), p<0.001). Further, the extremely low proportion of frontline HCWs reported that they would take a leave of absence to avoid infection (1.2%). Conclusions: Both frontline and non-frontline HCWs expressed comparable concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Because HCWs, especially frontline HCWs, reported that they cannot be obliged to do avoid their duty, effective mental health protection strategies should be developed and implemented for HCWs.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuki Sahashi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine; Department of Health Data Science, Graduate School of Data Science, Yokohama City Univers"},{"author_name":"Hirohisa Endo","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tadafumi Sugimoto","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Mie University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takeru Nabeta","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimitaka Nishizaki","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Nephrology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Kikuchi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Osaka General Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shingo Matsumoto","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Toho University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Sato","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadahiro Goto","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Health Economics, School of Public Health, The University of Tokyo; TXP Medical Co.

novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality show only small variation even though the number of deaths per country shows large variation. To understand the determinant for this situation, we constructed a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics and natural history of COVID-19 and analyzed the dataset of fatal cases of COVID-19 in Italy, Spain, and Japan. We estimated the parameter which describes the age-dependency of susceptibility by fitting the model to reported data, taking into account the effect of change in contact patterns during the outbreak of COVID-19, and the fraction of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Our modelling study revealed that if the mortality rate or the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases does not depend on age, then unrealistically different age-dependencies of susceptibilities against COVID-19 infections between Italy, Japan, and Spain are required to explain the similar age distribution of mortality but different basic reproduction numbers (R0). Variation of susceptibility by age itself cannot explain the robust age distribution in mortality by COVID-19 in those three countries, however it does suggest that the age-dependencies of i) the mortality rate and ii) the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases determine the age distribution of mortality by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryosuke Omori","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Ryota Matsuyama","author_inst":"Hiroshima University"},{"author_name":"Yukihiko Nakata","author_inst":"Aoyama Gakuin University"},{"author_name":"Takeru Nabeta","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimitaka Nishizaki","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Nephrology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Kikuchi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Osaka General Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shingo Matsumoto","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Toho University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Sato","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadahiro Goto","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Health Economics, School of Public Health, The University of Tokyo; TXP Medical Co.

Efforts to delay and reduce infections can compromise their own success, especially in populations with age-structure in both disease risk and social learning - two critical features of the current COVID-19 crisis. Our results concur with anecdotal observations of age-based differences in reactions to public health recommendations. We show how shifting reliance on types of learning affect the course of an outbreak, and could therefore factor into policy-based interventions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Carrignon","author_inst":"NIMBioS, University of Tennessee, Knoxville"},{"author_name":"R.

services have been recognized as a highly precautionary measure essential to protecting human health during this COVID-19 outbreak. However, it is currently unknown whether poor or non- availability of these services are also closely related to COVID-19 fatalities. We analysed the latest data on COVID-19 fatality rates in Sub Saharan Africa with indicators of safe water and sanitation governance to test this hypothesis. We found a strong correlation between a higher case fatality rate and poorer access to safe drinking water as well as safe sanitation. The Pearson correlation is stronger for access to safe sanitation ( -0.30) compared to access to safe drinking water (-0.20). The Chad, Niger and Sierra Leone were amongst the countries with the highest fatality rates (>6.0) and also had particularly poor access to safe drinking water (<34%) and safe sanitation (<22%). The hypothesis of an association between COVID-19 fatalities and poor access to water and sanitation was confirmed by this study. However, our analysis does not establish causality. Given the increase spread of COVID-19 and related deaths, this analysis serves as an important reminder that safe water and sanitation services are key for public health interventions and highlights the need to prioritise this sector in all economies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Godfred Amankwaa","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Christian Fischer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew Silk","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Nina H Fefferman","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Kimitaka Nishizaki","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Nephrology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Kikuchi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Osaka General Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shingo Matsumoto","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Toho University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Sato","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadahiro Goto","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Health Economics, School of Public Health, The University of Tokyo; TXP Medical Co.

longitudinal study","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20120584","rel_abs":"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 infection in Healthcare Workers (HCWs) is a public health concern during the pandemic. Little description has been made of their antibody response over time in the presence or absence detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA and of symptoms. We followed a cohort of patient-facing HCWs at an acute hospital in London to measure seroconversion and RNA detection at the peak of the pandemic in London. Methods We enrolled 200 front-line HCWs between 26 March and 8 April 2020 and collected twice-weekly self-administered nose and throat swabs and monthly blood samples. Baseline and regular symptom data were also collected. Swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and serum for IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies to the virus spike protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. Findings We enrolled HCWs with a variety of roles who worked in areas where COVID-19 patients were admitted and cared for. During the first month of observation, 42\/200 (21%) HCWs were PCR positive in at least one nose and throat swab. Only 8\/42 HCW (19%) who were PCR positive during the study period had symptoms that met the current case definition. Of 181 HCWs who provided enrollment and follow-up blood samples, 82\/181 (45.3%) were seropositive; 36\/181 (19.9%) seroconverted during the study and 46\/181 (25.4%) were seropositive at both time points. In 33 HCWs who had positive serology at baseline but were PCR negative, 32 remained PCR negative throughout follow-up. One HCW had a PCR positive swab six days after enrollment, likely representing a waning infection. Interpretation The extremely high seropositivity and RNA detection in this cohort of front-line HCWs who worked during the peak of the pandemic brings policies to protect staff and patients in the hospital environment into acute focus. Our findings have implications for planning for the expected second wave and for future vaccination roll out campaigns in similar settings. The further evidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection indicates that asymptomatic surveillance of HCWs is essential while our study sets the foundations to answer pertinent questions around the duration of protective immune response and the risk of re-infection.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine Houlihan","author_inst":"University College London

evidence indicates sex differences in the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, whether immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 differ between sexes, and whether such differences explain male susceptibility to COVID-19, is currently unknown. In this study, we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19 patients. By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5, along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients. These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide important basis for the development of sex-based approach to the treatment and care of men and women with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takehiro Takahashi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wong","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Mallory Ellingson","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Carolina Lucas","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jon Klein","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Julio Silva","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jieun Oh","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Mao","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maria Tokuyama","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Annsea Park","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Amit Meir","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sun","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Eric Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

We studied the relationship between anti-spike ectodomain (ECD) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG titers, and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (VN) titers generated by two different in vitro assays using convalescent plasma samples obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients, including 13 who donated plasma multiple times. Only 23% (16\/68) of donors had been hospitalized. We also studied 16 samples from subjects found to have anti-spike protein IgG during surveillance screening of asymptomatic individuals. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers, and in vitro VN titer. Anti-RBD plasma IgG correlated slightly better than anti-ECD IgG titer with VN titer. The probability of a VN titer [&ge;]160 was 80% or greater with anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers of [&ge;]1:1350. Thirty-seven percent (25\/68) of convalescent plasma donors lacked VN titers [&ge;]160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease either VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2,814 asymptomatic adults found 27 individuals with anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers of [&ge;]1:1350, and evidence of VN [&ge;]1:160. Taken together, we conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors. Plasma anti-RBD or anti-ECD titer of [&ge;]1:1350 may provide critical information about protection against COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Salazar","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suresh V Kuchipudi","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University University Park : Penn State"},{"author_name":"Paul A Christensen","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Todd N Eagar","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Yi","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Picheng Zhao","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Jin","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"S.

As the function of the non-structural ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of host-pathogen relationship is still obscure, we investigated its role in host factor mimicry using computational protein modelling techniques. Modest sequence similarity of ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 with the substrate binding site within the C-terminus serine-protease catalytic domain of human complement factor 1 (F1; PDB ID: 2XRC), prompted us to verify their resemblance at the structural level. The modelled ORF8 protein was found to superimpose on the F1 fragment. Further, protein-protein interaction simulation confirmed ORF8 binding to C3b, an endogenous substrate of F1, via F1-interacting region on C3b. Docking results suggest ORF8 to occupy the binding groove adjacent to the conserved \"arginine-serine\" (RS) F1-mediated cleavage sites on C3b. Comparative H-bond interaction dynamics indicated ORF8\/C3b binding to be of higher affinity than the F1\/C3b interaction. Hence, ORF8 is predicted to inhibit C3b proteolysis by competing with F1 for C3b binding using molecular mimicry with a possibility of triggering unregulated complement activation. This could offer a mechanistic premise for the unrestrained complement activation observed in large number of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasdeep Singh","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine-Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sudeshna Kar","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Surajit Ganguly","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Medicine-Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Caio Coelho","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Monica Imbernon","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Deligia","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Romain Perbet","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Vincent Florent","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Marc Baroncini","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Florence Pasquier","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Francois Trottein","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Lille"},{"author_name":"Claude-Alain Maurage","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Virginie Mattot","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"Paolo Giacobini","author_inst":"Inserm UMR-S 1172"},{"author_name":"S.

We analyzed 294 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found that IGHV3-53 is the most frequently used IGHV gene for targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. We determined crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies +\/- Fab CR3022 ranging from 2.33 to 3.11 [A] resolution. The germline-encoded residues of IGHV3-53 dominate binding to the ACE2 binding site epitope with no overlap with the CR3022 epitope. Moreover, IGHV3-53 is used in combination with a very short CDR H3 and different light chains. Overall, IGHV3-53 represents a versatile public VH in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, where their specific germline features and minimal affinity maturation provide important insights for vaccine design and assessing outcomes.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng Yuan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hejun Liu","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C.
